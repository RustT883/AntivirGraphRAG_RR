17512723	RDH12, a retinol dehydrogenase causing Leber's congenital amaurosis, is also involved in steroid metabolism.	Three retinol dehydrogenases (RDHs) were tested for steroid converting abilities: human and murine RDH 12 and human RDH13. RDH12 is involved in retinal degeneration in Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA). We show that murine Rdh12 and human RDH13 do not reveal activity towards the checked steroids, but that human type 12 RDH reduces dihydrotestosterone to androstanediol, and is thus also involved in steroid metabolism. Furthermore, we analyzed both expression and subcellular localization of these enzymes.
23557993	A diarylheptanoid phytoestrogen from Curcuma comosa, 1,7-diphenyl-4,6-heptadien-3-ol, accelerates human osteoblast proliferation and differentiation.	Curcuma comosa Roxb. is ginger-family plant used to relieve menopausal symptoms. Previous work showed that C. comosa extracts protect mice from ovariectomy-induced osteopenia with minimal effects on reproductive organs, and identified the diarylheptanoid (3R)-1,7-diphenyl-(4E,6E)-4,6-heptadien-3-ol (DPHD) as the major active component of C. comosa rhizomes. At 1-10μM, DPHD increased differentiation in transformed mouse osteoblasts, but the effect of DPHD on normal bone cells was unknown. We examined the concentration dependency and mechanism of action of DPHD relative to 17β-estradiol in nontransformed human osteoblasts (h-OB). The h-OB were 10-100 fold more sensitive to DPHD than transformed osteoblasts: DPHD increased h-OB proliferation at 10nM and, at 100nM, activated MAP kinase signaling within 30min. In long-term differentiation assays, responses of h-OB to DPHD were significant at 10nM, and optimal response in most cases was at 100nM. At 7-21 days, DPHD accelerated osteoblast differentiation, indicated by alkaline phosphatase activity and osteoblast-specific mRNA production. Effects of DPHD were eliminated by the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI182780. During differentiation, DPHD promoted early expression of osteoblast transcription factors, RUNX2 and osterix. Subsequently, DPHD accelerated production of bone structural genes, including COL1A1 and osteocalcin comparably to 17β-estradiol. In h-OB, DPHD increased the osteoprotegerin to RANKL ratio and supported mineralization more efficiently than 10nM 17β-estradiol. We conclude that DPHD promotes human osteoblast function in vitro effectively at nanomolar concentrations, making it a promising compound to protect bone in menopausal women.
23161873	The role of the carbohydrate response element-binding protein in male fructose-fed rats.	By 2030, nearly half of Americans will have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. In part, this epidemic is fueled by the increasing consumption of caloric sweeteners coupled with an innate capacity to convert sugar into fat via hepatic de novo lipogenesis. In addition to serving as substrates, monosaccharides also increase the expression of key enzymes involved in de novo lipogenesis via the carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP). To determine whether ChREBP is a potential therapeutic target, we decreased hepatic expression of ChREBP with a specific antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) in male Sprague-Dawley rats fed either a high-fructose or high-fat diet. ChREBP ASO treatment decreased plasma triglyceride concentrations compared with control ASO treatment in both diet groups. The reduction was more pronounced in the fructose-fed group and attributed to decreased hepatic expression of ACC2, FAS, SCD1, and MTTP and a decrease in the rate of hepatic triglyceride secretion. This was associated with an increase in insulin-stimulated peripheral glucose uptake, as assessed by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. In contrast, ChREBP ASO did not alter hepatic lipid content or hepatic insulin sensitivity. Interestingly, fructose-fed rats treated with ChREBP ASO had increased plasma uric acid, alanine transaminase, and aspartate aminotransferase concentrations. This was associated with decreased expression of fructose aldolase and fructokinase, reminiscent of inherited disorders of fructose metabolism. In summary, these studies suggest that targeting ChREBP may prevent fructose-induced hypertriglyceridemia but without the improvements in hepatic steatosis and hepatic insulin responsiveness.
17292977	Biological activity of AC3174, a peptide analog of exendin-4.	Exenatide, the active ingredient of BYETTA (exenatide injection), is an incretin mimetic that has been developed for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. Exenatide binds to and activates the known GLP-1 receptor with a potency comparable to that of the mammalian incretin GLP-1(7-36), thereby acting as a glucoregulatory agent. AC3174 is an analog of exenatide with leucine substituted for methionine at position 14, [Leu(14)]exendin-4. The purpose of these studies was to evaluate the glucoregulatory activity and pharmacokinetics of AC3174. In RINm5f cell membranes, the potency of AC3174 for the displacement of [(125)I]GLP-1 and activation of adenylate cyclase was similar to that of exenatide and GLP-1. In vivo, AC3174, administered as a single IP injection, significantly decreased plasma glucose concentration and glucose excursion following the administration of an oral glucose challenge in both non-diabetic (C57BL/6) and diabetic db/db mice (P<0.05 vs. vehicle-treated). The magnitude of glucose lowering of AC3174 was comparable to exenatide. The ED(50) values of AC3174 for glucose lowering (60 minute post-dose) were 1.2 microg/kg in db/db mice and 1.3 microg/kg in C57BL/6 mice. AC3174 has insulinotropic activity in vivo. Administration of AC3174 resulted in a 4-fold increase in insulin concentrations in normal mice following an IP glucose challenge. AC3174 was also shown to inhibit food intake and decrease gastric emptying in rodent models. AC3174 was stable in human plasma (>90% of parent peptide was present after 5 h of incubation). In rats, the in vivo half-life of AC3174 was 42-43 min following SC administration. In summary, AC3174 is an analog of exenatide that binds to the GLP-1 receptor in vitro and shares many of the biological and glucoregulatory activities of exenatide and GLP-1 in vivo.
23348500	A novel metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 positive allosteric modulator acts at a unique site and confers stimulus bias to mGlu5 signaling.	Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5) is a target for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders, such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, mGlu5 has been shown to play an important role in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, specifically in long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP), which is thought to be involved in cognition. Multiple mGlu5-positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) have been developed from a variety of different scaffolds. Previous work has extensively characterized a common allosteric site on mGlu5, termed the MPEP (2-Methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine) binding site. However, one mGlu5 PAM, CPPHA (N-(4-chloro-2-[(1,3-dioxo-1,3-dihydro-2H-isoindol-2-yl)methyl]phenyl)-2-hydroxybenzamide), interacts with a separate allosteric site on mGlu5. Using cell-based assays and brain slice preparations, we characterized the interaction of a potent and efficacious mGlu5 PAM from the CPPHA series termed NCFP (N-(4-chloro-2-((4-fluoro-1,3-dioxoisoindolin-2-yl)methyl)phenyl)picolinamide). NCFP binds to the CPPHA site on mGlu5 and potentiates mGlu5-mediated responses in both recombinant and native systems. However, NCFP provides greater mGlu5 subtype selectivity than does CPPHA, making it more suitable for studies of effects on mGlu5 in CNS preparations. Of interest, NCFP does not potentiate responses involved in hippocampal synaptic plasticity (LTD/LTP), setting it apart from other previously characterized MPEP site PAMs. This suggests that although mGlu5 PAMs may have similar responses in some systems, they can induce differential effects on mGlu5-mediated physiologic responses in the CNS. Such stimulus bias by mGlu5 PAMs may complicate drug discovery efforts but would also allow for specifically tailored therapies, if pharmacological biases can be attributed to different therapeutic outcomes.
7828655	Dopamine receptor blockade increases dopamine D2 receptor and glutamic acid decarboxylase mRNAs in mouse substantia nigra.	To study the influence of dopaminergic activity on the expression of dopamine D2 receptors and glutamic acid decarboxylase in substantia nigra, mice were treated daily for several days with an irreversibly acting dopamine D1 and dopamine D2 receptor antagonist N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ) or with a selective irreversible D2 dopamine receptor antagonist fluphenazine-N-mustard. Mice were killed 24 h after the last injection. Dopamine D1 and dopamine D2 receptors were determined by receptor autoradiography, and dopamine D1 and dopamine D2 receptor mRNA and glutamic acid decarboxylase mRNA were determined by in situ hybridization histochemistry. The results showed that treatment with EEDQ, which blocked 80% to 85% of the dopamine D2 and dopamine D1 receptors in substantia nigra, increased the levels of dopamine D2 receptor mRNA in substantia nigra by about 27%. Treatment with fluphenazine-N-mustard, which blocked about 85% of the dopamine D2 receptors in substantia nigra but had no significant effect on dopamine D1 receptors, increased the levels of dopamine D2 receptor mRNA by about 34%. There were no detectable levels of dopamine D1 receptors, increased the levels of dopamine D2 receptor mRNA by about 34%. There were no detectable levels of dopamine D1 receptor mRNA in substantia nigra either in control animals or in animals treated with the dopamine receptor antagonists. Glutamic acid decarboxylase mRNA was expressed in several regions of the mid-brain but only that expressed in substantia nigra was altered by treatment with dopamine receptor antagonists.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
15456329	Nabumetone: therapeutic use and safety profile in the management of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.	Nabumetone is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory prodrug, which exerts its pharmacological effects via the metabolite 6-methoxy-2-naphthylacetic acid (6-MNA). Nabumetone itself is non-acidic and, following absorption, it undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism to form the main circulating active metabolite (6-MNA) which is a much more potent inhibitor of preferentially cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2. The three major metabolic pathways of nabumetone are O-demethylation, reduction of the ketone to an alcohol, and an oxidative cleavage of the side-chain occurs to yield acetic acid derivatives. Essentially no unchanged nabumetone and < 1% of the major 6-MNA metabolite are excreted unchanged in the urine from which 80% of the dose can be recovered and another 10% in faeces. Nabumetone is clinically used mainly for the management of patients with osteoarthritis (OA) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to reduce pain and inflammation. The clinical efficacy of nabumetone has also been evaluated in patients with ankylosing spondylitis, soft tissue injuries and juvenile RA. The optimum oral dosage of nabumetone for OA patients is 1 g once daily, which is well tolerated. The therapeutic response is superior to placebo and similar to nonselective COX inhibitors. In RA patients, nabumetone 1 g at bedtime is optimal, but an additional 0.5-1 g can be administered in the morning for patients with persistent symptoms. In RA, nabumetone has shown a comparable clinical efficacy to aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), diclofenac, piroxicam, ibuprofen and naproxen. Clinical trials and a decade of worldwide safety data and long-term postmarketing surveillance studies show that nabumetone is generally well tolerated. The most frequent adverse effects are those commonly seen with COX inhibitors, which include diarrhoea, dyspepsia, headache, abdominal pain and nausea. In common with other COX inhibitors, nabumetone may increase the risk of GI perforations, ulcerations and bleedings (PUBs). However, several studies show a low incidence of PUBs, and on a par with the numbers reported from studies with COX-2 selective inhibitors and considerably lower than for nonselective COX inhibitors. This has been attributed mainly to the non-acidic chemical properties of nabumetone but also to its COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor profile. Through its metabolite 6-MNA, nabumetone has a dose-related effect on platelet aggregation, but no effect on bleeding time in clinical studies. Furthermore, several short-term studies have shown little to no effect on renal function. Compared with COX-2 selective inhibitors, nabumetone exhibits similar anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties in patients with arthritis and there is no evidence of excess GI or other forms of complications to date.
17258485	Vitamin C transport and SVCT1 transporter expression in chick renal proximal tubule cells in culture.	The characteristics of vitamin C (ascorbic acid, ASC) transport were studied in polarized cultured monolayers of the chick (Gallus gallus) renal proximal tubule in Ussing chambers. Under voltage clamp conditions, monolayers responded to apical addition of ASC in a dose-dependent manner, with positive short circuit currents (I(SC)), ranging from 3 microA/cm(2) at 5 microM ASC to a maximal response of 27 microA/cm(2) at 200 microM, and a half-maximal response at 40 microM. There was no effect of basolateral addition of ASC, indicating a polarized transport process. The oxidized form of ASC, dehydroascorbic acid had negligible effects. The I(SC) response to ASC was completely eliminated with Na(+) ion replacement, and was also eliminated by bilateral reduction of bath Cl(-), from 137 to 2.6 mM. There was significant inhibition of the I(SC) responses to 30 microM ASC by the flavanoid quercetin (50 microM) and by 100 microM 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS) and 5-ethylisopropylamiloride (EIPA), blockers of anion exchangers and sodium-proton exchangers, respectively. There was no inhibition, however, by the chloride channel blocker 5-nitro-2(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid (NPPB). Phorbol 12-myristate 13 acetate (PMA), the phorbol ester activator of protein kinase C, caused a 37% decrease in the I(SC) response to ASC. Chicken-specific primers to an EST homolog of the human vitamin C transporter SVCT1 (SLC23A1) were designed and used to probe transporter expression in these cells. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated the presence of chicken SVCT1 in both cultured cells and in freshly isolated proximal tubule fragments. These data indicate the presence of an electrogenic, sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter (SVCT1) in the chick renal proximal tubule. Vitamin C transport and conservation by the kidney is likely to be especially critical in birds, due to high plasma glucose levels and resulting high levels of reactive oxygen species.
23545568	Stable and high-rate overcharge protection for rechargeable lithium batteries.	Rechargeable lithium or lithium-ion cells can be overcharge-protected by an electroactive polymer composite separator. The use of non-woven fibrous membranes instead of conventional microporous membranes as the composite substrates allowed better distribution of the electroactive polymer, which led to improved utilization and a 40-fold increase in sustainable current density. For the first time, stable overcharge protection for hundreds of cycles was demonstrated in several cell chemistries, including LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2, LiFePO4, and spinel Li1.05Mn1.95O4 half-cells. Protection at a charging rate as high as 5 C was achieved at a steady state cell potential below 4.85 V.
23152189	2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-mediated production of reactive oxygen species is an essential step in the mechanism of action to accelerate human keratinocyte differentiation.	Chloracne is commonly observed in humans exposed to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD); yet, the mechanism of toxicity is not well understood. Using normal human epidermal keratinocytes, we investigated the mechanism of TCDD-mediated enhancement of epidermal differentiation by integrating functional genomic, metabolomic, and biochemical analyses. TCDD increased the expression of 40% of the genes of the epidermal differentiation complex found on chromosome 1q21 and 75% of the genes required for de novo ceramide biosynthesis. Lipid analysis demonstrated that eight of the nine classes of ceramides were increased by TCDD, altering the ratio of ceramides to free fatty acids. TCDD decreased the expression of the glucose transporter, SLC2A1, and most of the glycolytic transcripts, followed by decreases in glycolytic intermediates, including pyruvate. NADH and Krebs cycle intermediates were decreased, whereas NAD(+) was increased. Mitochondrial glutathione (GSH) reductase activity and the GSH/glutathione disulfide ratio were decreased by TCDD, ultimately leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, characterized by decreased inner mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production, and increased production of the reactive oxygen species (ROS), hydrogen peroxide. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) antagonists blocked the response of many transcripts to TCDD, and the endpoints of decreased ATP production and differentiation, suggesting regulation by the AHR. Cotreatment of cells with chemical antioxidants or the enzyme catalase blocked the TCDD-mediated acceleration of keratinocyte cornified envelope formation, an endpoint of terminal differentiation. Thus, TCDD-mediated ROS production is a critical step in the mechanism of this chemical to accelerate keratinocyte differentiation.
7981624	Annexin 1 regulation in human epidermal cells.	Annexin 1 (named p35, lipocortin I or calpactin II), initially described as a glucocorticoid induced protein, belongs to a new characterized family of intracellular proteins. In the skin, the role of annexins has still not been elucidated. In a previous study, we reported the localization of annexin 1 in both freshly isolated human epidermal cells and in cultured keratinocytes using immunofluorescence, FACS analysis and immunoblotting techniques. The protein was characterized by Western blot and immunoprecipitation as a 35 kDa protein. Results from in vivo studies confirmed the presence of annexin 1 in basal and suprabasal layers of normal human skin with modified reactivity patterns in hyperproliferative lesions. In the present study, the role of glucocorticoids in annexin 1 regulation was investigated in epidermal cells by Western blot and immunoprecipation assays. In contrast to other studies, we found that glucocorticoid treatment of epidermal cells led to a decrease in annexin 1 content in the cytoplasm and the membranes of cells. As annexin 1 was not detected in the nucleus of cells, we conclude that there was a down regulation of annexin 1 after glucocorticoid treatments rather than a translocation of the protein to the nucleus. Despite the absence of the signal peptide sequence necessary for protein secretion, annexin 1 was released in the keratinocyte culture medium. We found that the protein was secreted only in low Ca2+ medium (0.15 mM), this process required an active metabolism.
11607047	A review of the pharmacological and clinical profile of mirtazapine.	The novel antidepressant mirtazapine has a dual mode of action. It is a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA) that acts by antagonizing the adrenergic alpha2-autoreceptors and alpha2-heteroreceptors as well as by blocking 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors. It enhances, therefore, the release of norepinephrine and 5-HT1A-mediated serotonergic transmission. This dual mode of action may conceivably be responsible for mirtazapine's rapid onset of action. Mirtazapine is extensively metabolized in the liver. The cytochrome (CYP) P450 isoenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 are mainly responsible for its metabolism. Using once daily dosing, steady-state concentrations are reached after 4 days in adults and 6 days in the elderly. In vitro studies suggest that mirtazapine is unlikely to cause clinically significant drug-drug interactions. Dry mouth, sedation, and increases in appetite and body weight are the most common adverse effects. In contrast to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), mirtazapine has no sexual side effects. The antidepressant efficacy of mirtazapine was established in several placebo-controlled trials. In major depression, its efficacy is comparable to that of amitriptyline, clomipramine, doxepin, fluoxetine, paroxetine, citalopram, or venlafaxine. Mirtazapine also appears to be useful in patients suffering from depression comorbid with anxiety symptoms and sleep disturbance. It seems to be safe and effective during long-term use.
12512695	Vascular effects of COX inhibition and AT1 receptor blockade in transgenic rats harboring mouse renin-2 gene.	Ang II-induced endothelial dysfunction is associated with perivascular inflammation and increased superoxide production in the vascular wall. The present study examined the role of cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-synthetized eicosanoids in the pathogenesis of Ang II-induced endothelial dysfunction in transgenic rats harboring mouse renin-2 gene (mREN2 rats). Five-to-six-week-old, heterozygous mREN2 rats received the following drug regimens for 8 weeks: 1) vehicle, 2) cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor (MF-tricyclic [3-(3,4-difluorophenyl)-4-(4-(methylsulfonyl) phenyl)-2(5H)-furanone], 14 mg/kg p.o.), 3) COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor (sulindac, 14 mg/kg p.o.), 4) angiotensin II receptor antagonist (losartan 40 mg/kg p.o.). Normotensive Sprague Dawley (SD) rats served as controls. In vitro vascular responses of the descending aorta and renal artery were studied using organ bath system. mREN2 rats developed pronounced hypertension which was associated with impaired endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vascular relaxations in the aorta. In contrast, the relaxation responses of the renal arteries remained largely unchanged in mREN2 rats. Urinary NO, excretion, a marker of total body NO generation, was also decreased in mREN2 rats. Neither non-selective COX inhibitor sulindac nor COX-2 selective MF-tricyclic were capable of preventing Ang II-induced hypertension or endothelial dysfunction in mREN2 rats, whereas ATi receptor antagonist losartan completely normalized blood pressure, vascular relaxation responses as well as urinary NOx excretion. Our findings indicate that NO synthesis and/or bioavailability as well as the sensitivity of arterial smooth muscle cells to NO are decreased in mREN2 rats. The present study also demonstrated that COX does not play a central role in the pathogenesis of Ang II-induced endothelial dysfunction in mREN2 rats.
23237733	Isoliquiritigenin showed strong inhibitory effects towards multiple UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) isoform-catalyzed 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) glucuronidation.	Isoliquiritigenin, a herbal ingredient with chalcone structure, has been speculated to be able to inhibit one of the most drug-metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT). Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the inhibition of isoliquiritigenin towards important UGT isoforms in the liver and intestine, including UGT1A1, 1A3, 1A6, 1A7, 1A8, 1A9 and 1A10. The recombinant UGT-catalyzed 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) glucuronidation was used as probe reactions. The results showed that 100μM of isoliquiritigenin inhibited the activity of UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A6, UGT1A7, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, and UGT1A10 by 95.2%, 76.1%, 78.9%, 87.2%, 67.2%, 94.8%, and 91.7%, respectively. The data fitting using Dixon plot and Lineweaver-Burk plot showed that the inhibition of UGT1A1, UGT1A9 and UGT1A10 by isoliquiritigenin was all best fit to the competitive inhibition, and the second plot using the slopes from the Lineweaver-Burk plot versus isoliquiritigenin concentrations was used to calculate the inhibition kinetic parameter (K(i)) to be 0.7μM, 0.3μM, and 18.3μM for UGT1A1, UGT1A9, and UGT1A10, respectively. All these results indicated the risk of clinical application of isoliquiritigenin on the drug-drug interaction and other possible diseases induced by the inhibition of isoliquiritigenin towards these UGT isoforms.
23361305	Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) and low mitochondrial membrane potential are specific for Barth syndrome.	Barth syndrome (BTHS) is an X-linked mitochondrial defect characterised by dilated cardiomyopathy, neutropaenia and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria (3-MGCA). We report on two affected brothers with c.646G > A (p.G216R) TAZ gene mutations. The pathogenicity of the mutation, as indicated by the structure-based functional analyses, was further confirmed by abnormal monolysocardiolipin/cardiolipin ratio in dry blood spots of the patients as well as the occurrence of this mutation in another reported BTHS proband. In both brothers, 2D-echocardiography revealed some features of left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) despite marked differences in the course of the disease; the eldest child presented with isolated cardiomyopathy from late infancy, whereas the youngest showed severe lactic acidosis without 3-MGCA during the neonatal period. An examination of the patients' fibroblast cultures revealed that extremely low mitochondrial membrane potentials (mtΔΨ about 50 % of the control value) dominated other unspecific mitochondrial changes detected (respiratory chain dysfunction, abnormal ROS production and depressed antioxidant defense). 1) Our studies confirm generalised mitochondrial dysfunction in the skeletal muscle and the fibroblasts of BTHS patients, especially a severe impairment in the mtΔΨ and the inhibition of complex V activity. It can be hypothesised that impaired mtΔΨ and mitochondrial ATP synthase activity may contribute to episodes of cardiac arrhythmia that occurred unexpectedly in BTHS patients. 2) Severe lactic acidosis without 3-methylglutaconic aciduria in male neonates as well as an asymptomatic mild left ventricular noncompaction may characterise the ranges of natural history of Barth syndrome.
9353417	Differential regulation of D2 and D4 dopamine receptor mRNAs in the primate cerebral cortex vs. neostriatum: effects of chronic treatment with typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs.	The RNase Protection Assay was used to examine the regulation of D2 and D4 dopamine receptor mRNAs in the cerebral cortex and neostriatum of nonhuman primates after chronic treatment with a wide spectrum of antipsychotic medications (chlorpromazine, clozapine, haloperidol, molindone, olanzapine, pimozide, remoxipride and risperidone). Tiapride, a D2 antagonist that lacks antipsychotic activity, was also included. All drugs were administered orally for 6 months at doses recommended for humans. All antipsychotic drug treatments examined in this study caused a statistically significant up-regulation of both the long and short isoforms of the D2 receptor mRNAs in the prefrontal and temporal cortex. Tiapride, in contrast, significantly up-regulated only the level of D2-long mRNA in these areas. The same drug treatments produced less uniform effects in the neostriatum than in the cortex: clozapine and olanzapine failed to significantly elevate either D2-long or D2-short receptor messages in this structure unlike all other drugs, including tiapride. In both the cerebral cortex and striatum, D4 receptor mRNA was upregulated by certain typical (chlorpromazine and haloperidol) and certain atypical (clozapine, olanzapine and risperidone) antipsychotic agents as well as by tiapride. Other drugs of the typical (molindone and pimozide) and atypical (remoxipride) classes had no effect on D4 mRNA levels in either cortical or striatal tissue. The finding that up-regulation of D2 dopamine receptor mRNAs was a consistently observed effect of a wide range of antipsychotic agents in the cerebral cortex but not in the neostriatum, coupled with the fact that the D2-short isoforms in the cortex were not regulated by a nonantipsychotic D2 antagonist, tiapride, draws attention to the importance of the D2 dopamine receptor in the cerebral cortex as a potentially critical, common site of action of antipsychotic medications.
14585280	Inhibitors of DNA methylation in the treatment of hematological malignancies and MDS.	"DNA methylation abnormalities have recently emerged as one of the most frequent molecular changes in hematopoietic neoplasms. Since methylation and transcriptional status are inversely correlated, the hypermethylation of genes involved in cell-cycle control and apoptosis could have a pathogenetic role in the development of cancer. In particular, high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and secondary leukemias show a high prevalence of tumor suppressor gene hypermethylation. The progression of chronic myeloproliferative diseases and of myelodysplastic syndromes, as well as that of lymphoproliferative diseases, is associated with an increased methylation rate, pointing to a role for hypermethylation of critical promoter regions in the transformation to more aggressive phenotypes. In the same line, a significantly worse prognosis has been shown for patients with hypermethylation of several genes compared to that of patients with unmethylated genes. For these reasons, the use of irreversible DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, such as 5-azacytidine and Decitabine, appears to be a promising option for the treatment of MDS and acute myeloid leukemia. In clinical trials, Azacytidine results in a significantly higher response rate, improved quality of life, reduced risk of leukemic transformation, and improved survival compared to supportive care. Similarly, Decitabine showed favorable results, promising response rates, a good nonhematologic toxicity profile, and a trend for better survival compared to intensive chemotherapy, particularly in older patients. The synergistic effect of histone deacetylase inhibitors, including phenylbutyrate (PB), in reactivating silenced genes encouraged clinical studies on the combination of PB and demethylating agents in hematological diseases, characterized by p15 silencing. The sequential administration of a ""first generation"" demethylating agent and HDAC inhibitors gave preliminary evidence of a reduced methylation of target genes, as also described with Decitabine. Clinical trials are still ongoing, and preliminary data indicate for the first time that the natural history of MDS may be changed by a non-intensive treatment, characterized by an outstanding toxicity profile."
23211364	AT1 receptor antagonism is proangiogenic in the brain: BDNF a novel mediator.	Candesartan is an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB) that has been to shown to limit ischemic stroke and improve stroke outcome. In experimental stroke, candesartan induces a proangiogenic effect that is partly attributable to vascular endothelial growth factor. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a member of the neurotrophin family that has been reported to have angiogenic effects and play an important role in recovery after stroke. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the role of BDNF in the proangiogenic effect of candesartan in the brain under hypertensive conditions. Accordingly, spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated with candesartan, and brain tissue samples were collected for quantification of BDNF expression. In addition, human cerebromicrovascular endothelial cells were treated with either low-dose (1 ƒM) or high-dose (1 µM) angiotensin II alone or in combination with candesartan (0.16 µM) to assess the effect of candesartan treatment and BDNF involvement in the behavior of endothelial cells. Candesartan significantly increased the expression of BDNF in the SHR (P < 0.05). In addition, candesartan reversed the antiangiogenic effect of the 1-µM dose of AngII (P = 0.0001). The observed effects of candesartan were ablated by neutralizing the effects of BDNF. Treatment with the AT2 antagonist PD-123319 significantly reduced tube-like formation in endothelial cells. AT2 stimulation induced the BDNF expression and migration (P < 0.05). In conclusion, candesartan exerts a proangiogenic effect on brain microvascular endothelial cells treated with angiotensin II. This response is attributable to increased BDNF expression and is mediated through stimulation of the AT2 receptor.
23624810	Antiaggressive activity of central oxytocin in male rats.	RATIONALE: A substantial body of research suggests that the neuropeptide oxytocin promotes social affiliative behaviors in a wide range of animals including humans. However, its antiaggressive action has not been unequivocally demonstrated in male laboratory rodents. OBJECTIVE: Our primary goal was to examine the putative serenic effect of oxytocin in a feral strain (wild type Groningen, WTG) of rats that generally show a much broader variation and higher levels of intermale aggression than commonly used laboratory strains of rats. METHODS: Resident animals were intracerebroventricularly (icv) administered with different doses of synthetic oxytocin and oxytocin receptor antagonist, alone and in combination, in order to manipulate brain oxytocin functioning and to assess their behavioral response to an intruder. RESULTS: Our data clearly demonstrate that acute icv administered oxytocin produces dose-dependent and receptor-selective changes in social behavior, reducing aggression and potentiating social exploration. These antiaggressive effects are stronger in the more offensive rats. On the other hand, administration of an oxytocin receptor antagonist tends to increase (nonsignificantly) aggression only in low-medium aggressive animals. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that transiently enhancing brain oxytocin function has potent antiaggressive effects, whereas its attenuation tends to enhance aggressiveness. In addition, a possible inverse relationship between trait aggression and endogenous oxytocinergic signaling is revealed. Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of brain oxytocinergic signaling for regulating intermale offensive aggression. This study supports the suggestion that oxytocin receptor agonists could clinically be useful for curbing heightened aggression seen in a range of neuropsychiatric disorders like antisocial personality disorder, autism, and addiction.
10626836	Lithium modulates desensitization of the glutamate receptor subtype gluR3 in Xenopus oocytes.	Analysis of splice variants and site-directed mutants of the AMPA receptor GluR3 expressed in Xenopus oocytes has shown that lithium produces a large potentiation of the GluR3 flop splice variant and suggested that lithium might inhibit rapid desensitization, which is characteristic of this receptor (Karkanias, N. and Papke, R., Subtype-specific effects of lithium on glutamate receptor function. J. Neurophysiol., 81 (1999) 1506-1512). We now show that mutation of the 769R/ G desensitization site (Lomeli, H.M.J., Melcher, T., Hoger, T., Geiger, J.R., Kuner, T., Monyer, H., Higuchi, M.B.A. and Seeburg, P.H, Control of kinetic properties of AMPA receptor channels by nuclear RNA editing. Science, 9(266) (1994) 1709-1713) greatly attenuates the lithium-induced potentiation of GluR3. Additionally, experiments with the non-desensitizing site-directed mutant GluR3(L507Y) (Stern-Bach, Y., Russo, S., Neuman, M. and Rosenmund, C., A point mutation in the glutamate binding site blocks desensitization of AMPA receptors. Neuron, 21 (1998) 907-918) further confirms that lithium enhances GluR3 responses by reducing desensitization, since lithium's effects are reversed in this mutant. Lithium's effects on GluR3 desensitization are distinct from the effects of aniracetam on desensitization. Specifically, aniracetam, which potentiates wild-type AMPA receptors, is ineffective on the non-desensitizing GluR3(L507Y) mutant, but has synergistic effects with lithium on wild-type receptors.
23536522	The effects of gender difference on monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension in rats.	The present study aimed to compare the effect of gender difference on hemodynamic consequences in the development of monocrotaline (MCT)-induced pulmonary hypertension in rat. The effect of antioxidant enzyme systems on the development of pulmonary hypertension mediated by the phytotoxin MCT and the effect of gender on these antioxidant systems were also investigated. For this purpose, the right ventricular pressures (RVPs) and right ventricular/heart weight (HW) ratios were compared between groups and the glutathione (GSH) level and superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities were determined in lung and liver tissue samples of rats. RVP and right ventricular/HW ratios significantly increased in the MCT group compared to the control group. In the MCT group, RVP was significantly higher in males than females. MCT-induced pulmonary hypertension resulted in decreased GSH level, decreased GST and SOD activities and increased CAT activity in lung and liver tissues of both male and female rats. In addition, the lung and liver GSH level and GST and SOD levels were higher in female control rats compared to male control rats. The results of the present study, that antioxidant enzyme activities were different between the groups, highlight the possible role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of MCT-induced pulmonary hypertension in rats. Moreover, the lower antioxidant defense capacity of male rats than female rats may be considered as a cause of more aggressive course of MCT-induced pulmonary hypertension in males compared to females.
23198810	Profluorogenic reductase substrate for rapid, selective, and sensitive visualization and detection of human cancer cells that overexpress NQO1.	Achieving the vision of identifying and quantifying cancer-related events and targets for future personalized oncology is predicated on the existence of synthetically accessible and economically viable probe molecules fully able to report the presence of these events and targets in a rapid and highly selective and sensitive fashion. Delineated here are the design and evaluation of a newly synthesized turn-on probe whose intense fluorescent reporter signature is revealed only through probe activation by a specific intracellular enzyme present in tumor cells of multiple origins. Quenching of molecular probe fluorescence is achieved through unique photoinduced electron transfer between the naphthalimide dye reporter and a covalently attached, quinone-based enzyme substrate. Fluorescence of the reporter dye is turned on by rapid removal of the quinone quencher, an event that immediately occurs only after highly selective, two-electron reduction of the sterically and conformationally restricted quinone substrate by the cancer-associated human NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase isozyme 1 (hNQO1). Successes of the approach include rapid differentiation of NQO1-expressing and -nonexpressing cancer cell lines via the unaided eye, flow cytometry, fluorescence imaging, and two-photon microscopy. The potential for use of the turn-on probe in longer-term cellular studies is indicated by its lack of influence on cell viability and its in vitro stability.
11426832	Characterization of organic anion transport inhibitors using cells stably expressing human organic anion transporters.	The organic anion transport system is involved in the tubular excretion of various clinically important drugs. The purpose of this study was to characterize the effects of various organic anion transport inhibitors on organic anion transport using proximal tubule cells stably expressing human organic anion transporter 1 (human-OAT1) and human-OAT3, which are localized to the basolateral membrane of the proximal tubule. Organic anion transport inhibitors including betamipron, cilastatin, KW-3902 (8-(noradamantan-3-yl)-1,3-dipropylxanthine) and probenecid significantly inhibited human-OAT1- and human-OAT3-mediated organic anion uptake in a dose-dependent manner. Kinetic analyses revealed that these inhibitions were competitive. The Ki values of betamipron, cilastatin, KW-3902 and probencid for human-OAT1 were 23.6, 1470, 7.82 and 12.1 microM, whereas those for human-OAT3 were 48.3, 231, 3.70 and 9.0 microM. These results suggest that betamipron and probenecid could inhibit both human-OAT1- and human-OAT3-mediated organic anion transport in vivo, whereas cilastatin could inhibit only human-OAT3-mediated one. In contrast, KW-3902 did not exert the effects of significance, whereas KW-3902 was the most potent.
10047461	Cyclin E-cdk2 activation is associated with cell cycle arrest and inhibition of DNA replication induced by the thymidylate synthase inhibitor Tomudex.	Tomudex (ZD1694) is a specific antifolate-based thymidylate synthase inhibitor active in a variety of solid tumor malignancies. Studies were carried out in vitro to evaluate downstream molecular alterations induced as a consequence of the potent and sustained inhibition of thymidylate synthase by Tomudex. Twenty-four hours following the initial 2-h treatment with Tomudex, human A253 head and neck squamous carcinoma cells, not expressing p53 and p21(WAF1), were accumulated with DNA content characteristic of early S phase of the cell cycle with a concomitant reduction of cells in G1 and G2/M phases. The changes in cyclin and cdk protein expression and their kinase activities were examined in control and drug-treated A253 cells. Tomudex treatment resulted in the decrease in p27(kip1) expression, with an increase in cyclin E and cdk2 protein expression and kinase activities 24 h after a 2-h exposure. Although cyclin A protein expression was markedly increased, cyclin A kinase activity was only slightly increased. Cyclin D1, cyclin B, cdk4, and cdc2 protein expression and kinase activities remain constant. Lack of activation of cyclin A- and B-cdc2 was associated with a reduced proportion of cells in G2/M phases. Increased cyclin E-cdk2 protein expression was accompanied by the inhibition of DNA synthesis, with a decrease in E2F-1 expression. These results propose that cyclin E-cdk2 kinase can negatively regulate DNA replication. The studies with dThyd rescue from cyclin E-cdk2 protein overexpression and growth inhibition by Tomudex indicate that increased cyclin E-cdk2 protein expression is associated with effective inhibition of thymidylate synthase and resultant dNTP pool imbalance. Provision of dThyd more than 24 h after exposure to Tomudex allowed cells to replicate DNA for a single cycle back to G1, but did not prevent the profound growth-inhibitory effect manifested in the following 5 days. Tomudex treatment resulted in a time-dependent induction of the megabase DNA fragments, followed by secondary 50- to 300-kb DNA fragmentation. The 50- to 300-kb DNA fragmentation may be derived from the inhibition of DNA synthesis associated with cyclin E-cdk2 activation. These results suggest that the megabase DNA fragmentation is induced as a consequence of inhibition of thymidylate synthase by Tomudex and kilobase DNA fragmentation may correlate with the reduction of p27(kip1) expression and the increase in cyclin E and cdk2 kinase activities. Activation of cyclin E and cdk2 kinases allows cells to transit from G1 to S phase accompanied by the inhibition of DNA synthesis. The changes in cell cycle regulatory proteins associated with growth inhibition and DNA damage by Tomudex are not p53 dependent.
9950599	Oxidative stress induces differential gene expression in a human lens epithelial cell line.	PURPOSE: To identify differentially expressed genes in a human lens epithelial cell line exposed to oxidative stress. METHODS: Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) differential display was used to evaluate differential gene expression in a human lens epithelial cell line (SRA 01-04) when cells were exposed for 3 hours to a single bolus of 200 microM hydrogen peroxide. Differentially expressed genes were identified through DNA sequencing and a nucleotide database search. Differential expression was confirmed by northern blot and RT-PCR analyses. RESULTS: Using 18 primer sets, 28 RT-PCR products were differentially expressed between control and hydrogen peroxide-treated cells. In stressed cells, mitochondrial transcripts nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) dehydrogenase subunit 4 and cytochrome b were downregulated 4-fold. Of the cytoplasmic mRNAs, glutamine cyclotransferase decreased 10-fold, whereas cytokine-inducible nuclear protein, alternative splicing factor 2, and beta-hydroxyisobutyryl-coenzyme A hydrolase increased 2-, 4-, and 10-fold, respectively. Analysis of mitochondrial transcripts in a 24-hour time course showed that NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 mRNA decreased by 2-fold as early as 1 hour after oxidative stress, whereas the rate of decrease was slower for cytochrome b, cytochrome oxidase III, and 16S rRNA. CONCLUSIONS: Oxidative stress induced specific expressed gene changes in hydrogen peroxide-treated lens cells, including genes involved in cellular respiration and mRNA and peptide processing. These early changes may reflect pathways involved in the defense, pathology, or both of the lens epithelium, which is exposed to oxidative stress throughout life.
18480678	Differential pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of methylphenidate enantiomers: does chirality matter?	d,l-threo-methylphenidate (MPH) is an effective first-line treatment for the symptoms associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. threo-methylphenidate inhibits the dopamine transporter and the norepinephrine transporter, resulting in elevations of these monoamines after impulse release. Although MPH has long been administered as a racemic mixture of the 2 enantiomers, d-MPH and l-MPH, converging lines of evidence drawn from investigations using in vitro systems, animal models, and humans indicate that it is predominantly, if not exclusively, d-MPH that mediates the pharmacological/therapeutic actions of MPH. In both rodent and primate animal models, the binding of radiolabeled d-MPH to dopamine transporter was found to be selective, saturable, and reversible, whereas binding of l-MPH was diffuse and nonspecific. The behavioral effects of the enantiomers of MPH have been tested in several animal models, and results indicate these observed behavioral changes are likewise mediated by d-MPH, whereas l-MPH has little or no effect.The contribution of the l-isomer to the overall pharmacological profile of the racemate remains unclear, owing to several studies suggesting that l-MPH may not be merely an inert isomeric ballast. For example, behavioral studies conducted in rats demonstrate an attenuation of the effect of d-MPH in animals pretreated with l-MPH, suggesting that l-MPH may interfere with the action of the active enantiomer. The importance of MPH chirality to central nervous system MPH receptor targeting has culminated in human imaging studies revealing that d-MPH binds specifically to striatal structures, whereas l-MPH binding is nonspecific. Taken together, data from in vitro, animal, and human studies support the premise that the d-enantiomer of MPH mediates the neurophysiological actions of MPH and therefore likely mediates its clinical efficacy.
8697470	[Inactivated factor VII exercises a powerful antithrombotic activity in an experimental model of recurrent arterial thrombosis].	The extrinsic coagulation pathway is activated when tissue factor (TF) is exposed as a consequence of arterial damage. TF binds to factor VII (FVII) or activated FVII (FVIIa), generating a complex that activates both FX and FIX, ultimately leading to thrombin formation. To determine whether inhibition of FVII binding to TF would result in antithrombotic effects, active site-blocked FVIIa (FVIIai) was used in a rabbit model of intravascular thrombus formation. In addition, to study the interaction between extrinsic coagulation pathway activation and platelet aggregation, in the same model of intravascular thrombus formation, recombinant human FVIIa was administered in antiplatelet-treated rabbits. Cyclic flow variations (CFVs), due to recurrent thrombus formation, were initiated by placing an external constrictor around the endothelially-injured rabbit carotid arteries (Folt's model). Carotid blood flow was measured continuously by a Doppler flow probe placed proximally to the constrictor. CFVs were induced in 29 New Zealand White rabbits. After CFVs were observed for 30 min, the animals were randomly divided in four groups: 5 animals received via a small catheter (26G) placed proximally to the stenosis, an intra-arterial infusion of human recombinant FVIIai (0.1 mg/kg/min for 10 min); 9 animals received AP-1, a monoclonal antibody against rabbit TF (0.1 mg/kg i.v. bolus); 7 animals received ridogrel, a dual thromboxane A2 synthetase inhibitor and thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist (10 mg/kg i.v. bolus); finally, 8 rabbits received aurintrycarboxilic acid (ATA), an inhibitor of platelet glycoprotein Ib/von Willebrand factor interaction (10 mg/kg i.v. bolus). FVIIai abolished CFVs in 5 of 5 animals (CFV frequency minutes 0 cycles/hour; p < 0.05; carotid blood flow velocity minutes 106 +/- 9% of the baseline values; NS vs baseline). AP-1 abolished CFVs in 7 of 9 animals (CFV frequency minutes 0 cycles/hour; p < 0.05; carotid blood flow velocity minutes 58 +/- 35% of the baseline values; NS vs baseline). Finally, in all the animals receiving ridogrel or ATA CFVs were abolished (CFV frequency 0 cycles/hour; p < 0.05 in both groups; carotid blood flow velocity, respectively 62 +/- 32 and 66 +/- 40% of the baseline values; NS vs baseline in both groups). Thirty minutes following inhibition of CFVs, in the FVIIai treated rabbits, human recombinant FVIIa was infused, via the small catheter placed proximally to the stenosis, at the dose of 0.1 mg/kg/min for 10 min. In the other three groups, FVIIa, at the same dose, was infused i.v. Infusion of FVIIa restored CFVs in all FVIIai treated animals and in 6 of 7 AP-1 treated animals, thus indicating that AP-1 and FVIIai bindings to TF was competitive and was replaced by FVIIa. Infusion of FVIIa failed to restore CFVs in ridogrel e ATA treated rabbits (1 of 7 and 0 of 8 rabbits, respectively), showing that activation of extrinsic coagulation by FVIIa was overcome by inhibition of platelet function. Activated partial thromboplastin time, and ex vivo platelet aggregation in response to ADP and thrombin, were not different after FVIIai infusion, while prothrombin time was slightly but significantly prolonged as compared to baseline values. Thus, FVII-VIIa plays an important role in initiating thrombus formation in vivo. Administration of FVIIai exerts a potent antithrombotic effects in this model without affecting systemic coagulation. In addition, in this model platelets exert an important role in arterial thrombosis, since in the presence of inhibition of platelet function, activation of the extrinsic coagulation pathway failed to restore thrombus formation.
23323829	Design and application of anthracene derivative with aggregation-induced emission charateristics for visualization and monitoring of erythropoietin unfolding.	Erythropoietin (EPO) is an attractive protein-unfolding/folding model because of its high degree of unfolding and folding reversibility and intermediate size. Due to its function for regulating red blood cell production by stimulating late erythroid precursor cells, EPO presents obvious values to biological research. A nonemissive anthracene derivative, that is 9,10-bis[4-(3-sulfonatopropoxyl)-styryl]anthracene sodium salt (BSPSA), with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) charateristics shows a novel phenomenon of AIE when EPO is added. The AIE biosensor for EPO shows the limit of detection is 1 × 10(-9) M. Utilizing the AIE feature of BSPSA, the unfolding process of EPO using guanidine hydrochloride is monitored, which indicates three steps for the folding structures of EPO to transform to random coil. Computational modeling suggests that the BSPSA luminogens prefer docking in the hydrophobic cavity in the EPO folding structures, and the assembly of BSPSA in this cavity makes the AIE available, making the monitoring of unfolding of EPO possible.
23404739	Optimization of marine triterpene sipholenols as inhibitors of breast cancer migration and invasion.	Sipholenol A, a sipholane triterpene isolated from the Red Sea sponge Callyspongia siphonella, has the ability to reverse multidrug resistance in cancer cells that overexpress P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Here, the antimigratory activity of sipholenol A and analogues are reported against the highly metastatic human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 in a wound-healing assay. Sipholenol A and sipholenone A were semisynthetically optimized using ligand-based strategies to generate structurally diverse analogues in an attempt to maximize their antimigratory activity. A total of 22 semisynthetic ester, ether, oxime, and carbamate analogues were generated and identified by extensive one- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy and high-resolution mass spectrometry analyses. Sipholenol A 4β-4-chlorobenzoate and 19,20-anhydrosipholenol A 4β-4-chlorobenzoate esters were the most potent of all tested analogues in the wound-healing assay, with IC(50) values of 5.3 and 5.9 μM, respectively. Generally, ester derivatives showed better antimigratory activities than the carbamate analogues. A KINOMEscan of 19,20-anhydrosipholenol A 4β-benzoate ester against 451 human protein kinases identified protein tyrosine kinase 6 (PTK6) as a potential target. In breast tumor cells, PTK6 promotes growth factor signaling and migration, and as such the semisynthetic sipholanes were evaluated for their ability to inhibit PTK6 phosphorylation in vitro. The two analogues with the highest antimigratory activities, sipholenol A 4β-4-chlorobenzoate and 19,20-anhydrosipholenol A 4β-4-chlorobenzoate esters, also exhibited the most potent inhibition of PTK6 phosphorylation inhibition. None of the compounds exhibited cytotoxicity in a normal epithelial breast cell line. These derivatives were evaluated in an in vitro invasion assay, where sipholenol A succinate potently inhibited MDA-MB-231 cell invasion at 10 μM. These results highlight sipholane triterpenoids as novel antimigratory marine natural products with potential for further development as agents for the control of metastatic breast malignancies.
23258671	Super-stable ultrafine beta-tungsten nanocrystals with metastable phase and related magnetism.	Ultrafine tungsten nanocrystals (average size of 3 nm) with a metastable phase (beta-tungsten with A15 structure, β-W) have been prepared by laser ablation of tungsten in liquid nitrogen. The as-prepared metastable nanocrystals exhibited super-stablity, and can keep the same metastable structure over a period of 6 months at room temperature. This super-stability is attributed to the nanosized confinement effect of ultrafine nanocrystals. The magnetism measurements showed that the β-W nanocrystals have weak ferromagnetic properties at 2 K, which may arise from surface defects and unpaired electrons on the surface of the ultrafine nanocrystals. These findings provided useful information for the application of ultrafine β-W nanocrystals in microelectronics and spintronics.
10403635	Success of pyridostigmine, physostigmine, eptastigmine and phosphotriesterase treatments in acute sarin intoxication.	The acute toxicity of organophosphorus (OP) compounds in mammals is due to their irreversible inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the nervous system, which leads to increased synaptic acetylcholine levels. The protective actions of intravenously (i.v.) administered pyridostigmine, physostigmine, eptastigmine, and an organophosphate hydrolase, phosphotriesterase, in acute sarin intoxication were studied in mice. The acute intragastric (i.g.) toxicity (LD50) of sarin with and without the pretreatments was tested by the up-and-down method. The mice received pyridostigmine (0.06 mg/kg body weight), physostigmine (0.09 mg/kg body weight), the physostigmine derivative eptastigmine (0.90 mg/kg body weight) or phosphotriesterase (104 U/g, 10.7 microg/g body weight) 10 min prior to the i.g. administration of sarin. Physostigmine was also administered with phosphotriesterase. Phosphotriesterase was the most effective antidote in sarin intoxication. The LD50 value for sarin increased 3.4-fold in mice receiving phosphotriesterase. Physostigmine was the most effective carbamate in sarin exposure. The protective ratios of physostigmine and pyridostigmine were 1.5- and 1.2-1.3-fold, respectively. Eptastigmine did not give any protection against sarin toxicity. Both the phosphotriesterase and physostigmine treatments protected the brain AChE activities measured 24 h after sarin exposure. In phosphotriesterase and physostigmine-treated mice, a 4- and 2-fold higher sarin dose, respectively, was needed to cause a 50% inhibition of brain AChE activity. Moreover, the combination of phosphotriesterase-physostigmine increased the LD50 value for sarin 4.3-fold. The animals pretreated with phosphotriesterase-ephysostigmine tolerated four times the lethal dose in control animals, furthermore their survival time was 2-3 h in comparison to 20 min in controls. In conclusion, phosphotriesterase and physostigmine were the most effective treatments against sarin intoxication. However, eptastigmine did not provide any protection against sarin toxicity.
23585380	Dual Growth Factor Delivery Using Biocompatible Core-Shell Microcapsules for Angiogenesis.	An optimized electrodropping system produces homogeneous core-shell microcapsules (C-S MCs) by using poly(L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and alginate. Fluorescence imaging clearly shows the C-S domain in the MC. For release control, the use of high-molecular-weight PLGA (HMW 270 000) restrains the initial burst release of protein compared to that of low-MW PLGA (LMW 40 000). Layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly of chitosan and alginate on MCs is also useful in controlling the release profile of biomolecules. LBL (7-layer) treatment is effective in suppressing the initial burst release of protein compared to no LBL (0-layer). The difference of cumulative albumin release between HMW (7-layer LBL) and LMW (0-layer LBL) PLGA is determined to be more than 40% on day 5. When dual angiogenic growth factors (GFs), such as platelet-derived GF (PDGF) and vascular endothelial GF (VEGF), are encapsulated separately in the core and shell domains, respectively, the VEGF release rate is much greater than that of PDGF, and the difference of the cumulative release percentage between the two GFs is about 30% on day 7 with LMW core PLGA and more than 45% with HMW core PLGA. As for the angiogenic potential of MC GFs with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), the fluorescence signal of CD31+ suggests that the angiogenic sprout of ECs is more active in MC-mediated GF delivery than conventional GF delivery, and this difference is significant, based on the number of capillary branches in the unit area. This study demonstrates that the fabrication of biocompatible C-S MCs is possible, and that the release control of biomolecules is adjustable. Furthermore, MC-mediated GFs remain in an active form and can upregulate the angiogenic activity of ECs.
15276688	Extracellular serotonin, dopamine and glutamate levels are elevated in the hypothalamus in a serotonin syndrome animal model induced by tranylcypromine and fluoxetine.	Serotonin (5-HT) syndrome is a potentially fatal condition associated with various combinations of serotonergic drugs. The present study was undertaken to demonstrate that nervous systems other than the 5-HT system also participate in the pathophysiology of 5-HT syndrome. Concentrations of 5-HT, dopamine (DA) and glutamate in the hypothalamus were measured in two different 5-HT syndrome animal models using a microdialysis technique. The first model was induced by tranylcypromine, a nonselective monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor (3.5 mg/kg) and fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) (10 mg/kg). The second model was induced by clorgyline, an MAO-A inhibitor (1.2 mg/kg) and 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan, a precursor of 5-HT (5-HTP) (80 mg/kg). In the first model, the levels of 5-HT and DA increased by 40-fold and 44-fold, respectively, compared with the preadministration levels. In the second model, the concentrations of 5-HT increased by up to 140-fold, whereas DA levels increased by only 10-fold, of the preadministration levels. Although the level of glutamate in the second model barely changed, a delayed increase in the glutamate level was observed in the first model. These findings suggest that not only hyperactivity of the 5-HT system, but also hyperactivity of the DA system, are present in 5-HT syndrome, and that the glutamatergic system is influenced in some 5-HT syndrome cases in which the DA concentration markedly increases.
15561708	Characterization of the NifS-like domain of ABA3 from Arabidopsis thaliana provides insight into the mechanism of molybdenum cofactor sulfuration.	The molybdenum cofactor sulfurase ABA3 from Arabidopsis thaliana specifically regulates the activity of the molybdenum enzymes aldehyde oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase by converting their molybdenum cofactor from the desulfo-form into the sulfo-form. ABA3 is a two-domain protein with an NH2-terminal domain sharing significant similarities to NifS proteins that catalyze the decomposition of l-cysteine to l-alanine and elemental sulfur for iron-sulfur cluster synthesis. Although different in its physiological function, the mechanism of ABA3 for sulfur mobilization was found to be similar to NifS proteins. The protein binds a pyridoxal phosphate cofactor and a substrate-derived persulfide intermediate, and site-directed mutagenesis of strictly conserved binding sites for the cofactor and the persulfide demonstrated that they are essential for molybdenum cofactor sulfurase activity. In vitro, the NifS-like domain of ABA3 activates aldehyde oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase in the absence of the C-terminal domain, but in vivo, the C-terminal domain is required for proper activation of both target enzymes. In addition to its cysteine desulfurase activity, ABA3-NifS also exhibits selenocysteine lyase activity. Although l-selenocysteine is unlikely to be a natural substrate for ABA3, it is decomposed more efficiently than l-cysteine. Besides mitochondrial AtNFS1 and plastidial AtNFS2, which are both proposed to be involved in iron-sulfur cluster formation, ABA3 is proposed to be a third and cytosolic NifS-like cysteine desulfurase in A. thaliana. However, the sulfur transferase activity of ABA3 is used for post-translational activation of molybdenum enzymes rather than for iron-sulfur cluster assembly.
7911719	Functional studies on alpha 1-adrenoceptor subtypes mediating inotropic effects in rat right ventricle.	1. We have studied the alpha 1-adrenoceptor subtypes mediating inotropic effects of adrenaline in rat right ventricle and the Ca2+ sources used to elicit these effects. alpha 1A-Adrenoceptor-mediated contractile effects in rat vas deferens were studied for comparison in some cases. 2. Treatment with chloroethylclonidine did not affect the maximal beta-adrenoceptor-mediated inotropic effects in rat right ventricle or the maximal alpha 1A-adrenoceptor-mediated contractile effects in rat vas deferens; it did not alter the potency of isoprenaline in the ventricle and reduced the potency of the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists in vas deferens only slightly. Treatment of right ventricular strips with CdCl2 markedly reduced resting tension and enhanced maximal inotropic effects of isoprenaline but did not affect its potency. 3. Inactivation of cardiac alpha 1B-adrenoceptors by treatment with chloroethylclonidine slightly enhanced the maximal inotropic effects of the full agonist, adrenaline and of several partial agonists. 4. Schild analysis of inhibition experiments with the alpha 1A-adrenoceptor-selective antagonists, 5-methyl-urapidil and (+/-)-tamsulosin, demonstrated that adrenaline causes its inotropic effects mainly via the alpha 1B-adrenoceptor subtype. Schild analysis of 5-methyl-urapidil inhibition experiments in chloroethylclonidine-treated ventricles indicated that only alpha 1A-adrenoceptors mediate the inotropic effects of adrenaline following inactivation of the alpha 1B-adrenoceptors. 5. In control ventricles the organic Ca2+ entry blocker, nitrendipine and treatment with the inorganic Ca2+ entry blocker, CdCl2 did not reduce inotropic effects of adrenaline whereas ryanodine treatment inhibited them. In contrast, nitrendipine and CdCl2 treatment had major inhibitory effects in chloroethylclonidine-treated but lacked inhibitory effects in phenoxybenzamine-treated ventricular strips. 6. We conclude that inotropic effects of adrenaline in rat heart are mediated mainly by alpha 1B-adrenoceptors via release of Ca2+ from an intracellular pool. Following inactivation of alpha 1B-adrenoceptors by chloroethylclonidine treatment, alpha lA-adrenoceptors can fully compensate and mediate inotropic effects by promoting influx of extracellular Ca2+ at least partly via voltage-operated channels.Therefore, we speculate that alpha 1B-adrenoceptors exert a tonic inhibitory effect on alpha 1A-adrenoceptors.
17372252	An international case-control study of glutathione transferase and functionally related polymorphisms and risk of primary adult brain tumors.	BACKGROUND: Glutathione transferases (GST) detoxify environmental and endogenous compounds and levels of two polymorphic GST proteins, GSTM3 and GSTP1, are high in the brain. Previous studies of GSTM3 and GSTP1 polymorphisms and adult brain tumor risk have produced inconsistent results, whereas the GSTM3 -63 variant is newly identified and, therefore, has not yet been studied in this context. We therefore examined associations between GSTM3 -63, GSTM3 *A/*B, GSTP1 105, and GSTP1 114 variants and adult brain tumor risk and the interaction of the effects of these same polymorphisms with cigarette smoking. In addition, the enzymes NQO1 and CYP1A1 alter susceptibility to oxidative brain damage. Because there is less previous evidence for a role of NQO1, CYP1A1, GSTM1, and GSTT1 variants, we restricted analysis of these variants to a small preliminary study. METHODS: We genotyped DNA collected for an international population-based case-control study of 725 glioma cases, 329 of which were glioblastoma cases, 546 meningioma cases and 1,612 controls. Study participants were residents of Sweden, southeast England, Denmark, and Finland. RESULTS: We found no associations between the GSTM3, GSTP1, NQO1, CYP1A1, GSTM1, or GSTT1 polymorphisms and adult brain tumor risk with the possible exception of a weak association between the G-C (Val-Ala) GSTP1 105/114 haplotype and glioma [odds ratio (OR), 0.73; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.54, 0.99], nor was there an interaction between the effects of the GSTM3 or GSTP1 polymorphisms and cigarette smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we observed no strong evidence for an association between GST or related enzyme polymorphisms and adult brain tumor risk.
23086035	PGC-1α improves glucose homeostasis in skeletal muscle in an activity-dependent manner.	Metabolic disorders are a major burden for public health systems globally. Regular exercise improves metabolic health. Pharmacological targeting of exercise mediators might facilitate physical activity or amplify the effects of exercise. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) largely mediates musculoskeletal adaptations to exercise, including lipid refueling, and thus constitutes such a putative target. Paradoxically, forced expression of PGC-1α in muscle promotes diet-induced insulin resistance in sedentary animals. We show that elevated PGC-1α in combination with exercise preferentially improves glucose homeostasis, increases Krebs cycle activity, and reduces the levels of acylcarnitines and sphingosine. Moreover, patterns of lipid partitioning are altered in favor of enhanced insulin sensitivity in response to combined PGC-1α and exercise. Our findings reveal how physical activity improves glucose homeostasis. Furthermore, our data suggest that the combination of elevated muscle PGC-1α and exercise constitutes a promising approach for the treatment of metabolic disorders.
22424117	Antioxidant and lipoxygenase inhibiting new iridoid glucosides from Caryopteris odorata.	The phytochemical investigation of the ethylacetate-soluble fraction of Caryopteris odorata (Ham. ex Roxb.) led to the isolation of four new iridoid glucosides (1-4): 8-O-trans-cinnamoyl caryoptoside (1), 8-O-trans-cinnamoyl shanzhiside methylester (2), 8-O-trans-cinnamoyl mussaenoside (3) and 8-O-cafeoyl massenoside (4). The structures of these compounds were determined by FAB-MS, IR, 1D and 2D-NMR spectroscopy and by comparing with the published data of the closely related compounds. The antioxidant potential of the isolated iridoids (1-4) was evaluated relative to conventionally used standards and these molecules exhibited good antioxidant potential. Moreover, their inhibitory potential was also screened against three enzymes, namely acetyl cholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase and lipoxygenase. These iridoid glucosides were found to be inactive against acetyl and butyrylcholinesterases but active against lipoxygenase.
3917545	Inactivation of prostaglandin H synthase and prostacyclin synthase by phenylbutazone. Requirement for peroxidative metabolism.	Phenylbutazone (PB), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is an efficient reducing cofactor for the peroxidase activity of prostaglandin H synthase (PHS). Most reducing cofactors for the peroxidase protect PHS and prostacyclin synthase from inactivation by hydroperoxides. PB, however, does not protect these enzymes, but rather augments their hydroperoxide-dependent inactivation. Using ram seminal vesicle microsomes as a source of PHS and prostacyclin synthase, we have examined the interaction of PB and exogenous hydroperoxides. Chromatographic analysis of the metabolism of 14C-labeled arachidonic acid in this system revealed that PB-dependent inactivation of PHS is markedly increased in the presence of 100 microM H2O2. This inactivation is a linear function of PB concentration between 10 and 250 microM, with a half-maximal effect in this range at about 100 microM PB. Prostacyclin synthase is even more sensitive to inactivation by the combined PB and H2O2 treatment, with a corresponding half-maximal effect at PB concentrations near 25 microM. This PB- and H2O2-dependent inactivation is demonstrable whether PGH2 is generated in situ from arachidonic acid or is added exogenously, supporting a direct effect of the treatment on prostacyclin synthase. As PB undergoes peroxide-dependent co-oxygenation catalyzed by PHS, we propose that it is an oxygenated derivative of PB, rather than the parent compound, which is responsible for the inactivation of PHS and prostacyclin synthase. Nafazatrom, a competitive inhibitor of PB co-oxygenation, blocks the effects of the PB and H2O2 treatment, supporting our proposal.
7832763	Expression and selective inhibition of the constitutive and inducible forms of human cyclo-oxygenase.	The enzyme cyclo-oxygenase catalyses the oxygenation of arachidonic acid, leading to the formation of prostaglandins. Recently two forms of cyclo-oxygenase have been described: a constitutive (COX-1) enzyme present in most cells and tissues, and an inducible (COX-2) isoenzyme observed in many cells in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines. Constitutive and inducible forms of human cyclo-oxygenase (hCOX-1 and hCOX-2) were cloned and expressed in insect cells, utilizing a baculovirus expression system. hCOX-1 had a specific activity of 18.8 mumol of O2/mg with a Km of 13.8 microM for arachidonate and Vmax. of 1500 nmol of O2/nmol of enzyme, whereas hCOX-2 had a specific activity of 12.2 mumol of O2/mg with a Km of 8.7 microM for arachidonate and a Vmax. of 1090 nmol of O2/nmol of enzyme. Indomethacin inhibited both hCOX-1 and hCOX-2, whereas NS-398 and Dup-697 selectively inhibited hCOX-2. Both NS-398 and Dup-697 exhibited time-dependent inactivation of hCOX-2, as did indomethacin on both enzymes. The competitive inhibitor of hCOX-1, mefenamic acid, also displayed competitive inhibition of hCOX-2. These results demonstrate the ability to generate selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which could provide useful improvement therapeutically in the treatment of chronic inflammatory disease.
23386616	Toll-like receptor 2 mediates peripheral nerve injury-induced NADPH oxidase 2 expression in spinal cord microglia.	We have previously reported that NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2) is up-regulated in spinal cord microglia after spinal nerve injury, demonstrating that it is critical for microglia activation and subsequent pain hypersensitivity. However, the mechanisms and molecules involved in Nox2 induction have not been elucidated. Previous studies have shown that Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are involved in nerve injury-induced spinal cord microglia activation. In this study, we investigated the role of TLR in Nox2 expression in spinal cord microglia after peripheral nerve injury. Studies using TLR knock-out mice have shown that nerve injury-induced microglial Nox2 up-regulation is abrogated in TLR2 but not in TLR3 or -4 knock-out mice. Intrathecal injection of lipoteichoic acid, a TLR2 agonist, induced Nox2 expression in spinal cord microglia both at the mRNA and protein levels. Similarly, lipoteichoic acid stimulation induced Nox2 expression and reactive oxygen species production in primary spinal cord glial cells in vitro. Studies on intracellular signaling pathways indicate that NF-κB and p38 MAP kinase activation is required for TLR2-induced Nox2 expression in glial cells. Conclusively, our data show that TLR2 mediates nerve injury-induced Nox2 gene expression in spinal cord microglia via NF-κB and p38 activation and thereby may contribute to spinal cord microglia activation.
17590520	Nicotine receptor gene CHRNA4 modulates early event-related potentials in auditory and visual oddball target detection tasks.	The present study seeks to identify effects of a common genetic polymorphism in the human nicotinic alpha4beta2 receptor on components of the cognitive event-related potentials in auditory and visual modalities. The same sense thymine-to-cytosine polymorphism (c.1629T-C; Ser543Ser) was shown to preferentially modulate early components in both modalities. Specifically, the auditory N1 component amplitude was higher for T allele homozygotes than for C allele carriers. The visual P1 component revealed the same pattern of significant polymorphic modulation, but the later N1 amplitude differences were only marginally significant. There was no reliable indication of interactions between genotype and task factors. Parallel modulation of early latency modality-specific event-related potential (ERP) components in vision and audition may indicate that the CHRNA4 polymorphism affects factors that are common to top-down modulation of sensory processing across modalities.
23416191	Fragment-based drug design and identification of HJC0123, a novel orally bioavailable STAT3 inhibitor for cancer therapy.	Fragment-based drug design (FBDD) is a promising approach for the generation of lead molecules with enhanced activity and especially drug-like properties against therapeutic targets. Herein, we report the fragment-based drug design, systematic chemical synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of novel scaffolds as potent anticancer agents by utilizing six privileged fragments from known STAT3 inhibitors. Several new molecules such as compounds 5, 12, and 19 that may act as advanced chemical leads have been identified. The most potent compound 5 (HJC0123) has demonstrated to inhibit STAT3 promoter activity, downregulate phosphorylation of STAT3, increase the expression of cleaved caspase-3, inhibit cell cycle progression and promote apoptosis in breast and pancreatic cancer cells with low micromolar to nanomolar IC50 values. Furthermore, compound 5 significantly suppressed estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumor growth in vivo (p.o.), indicating its great potential as an efficacious and orally bioavailable drug candidate for human cancer therapy.
17069932	High-affinity GABA uptake and GABA-metabolizing enzymes in pig forebrain white matter: a quantitative study.	GABA receptor activation in central nervous white matter may be protective during white matter hypoxia in the adult, and it may modify axonal conduction, especially in the developing brain. GABA uptake is important for the shaping of the GABA signal, but quantitative data are lacking for GABA uptake and GABA-metabolizing enzymes in central nervous white matter. We report that high-affinity uptake of GABA in adult pig corpus callosum, fimbria, subcortical pyramidal tracts, and occipital white matter is approximately 20% of that in temporal cortex gray matter. Tiagabine (0.1 microM), an antiepileptic drug that specifically inhibits the GAT-1 GABA transporter inhibited GABA uptake 50% in temporal cortex and 60-68% in white structures. This finding indicates that GAT-1 is an important GABA transporter in white matter and suggests that white matter GABA uptake is inhibited during tiagabine therapy. GABA transaminase activity in white structures was approximately 20% of neocortical values. Glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) activity in white structures was only 4% of that in neocortex (7-12 pmol/mg tissue x min(-1) versus approximately 200 pmol/mg tissue x min(-1)). Since white matter activity of citrate synthase of the tricarboxylic acid cycle was approximately 25% of neocortical values ( approximately 0.4 nmol/mg tissue x min(-1) versus approximately 1.5 nmol/mg tissue x min(-1)), the low GAD activity suggests a slower metabolic turnover of GABA in white than in gray matter.
14753499	Aquaporin-1 deletion reduces osmotic water permeability and cerebrospinal fluid production.	Aquaporin-1 (AQP1) is a water channel that is strongly expressed at the ventricular-facing surface of choroid plexus epithelium. Using wildtype and AQP1 null mice, we developed novel methods to compare the water permeability in isolated choroid plexus, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production in living mice. Osmotically-induced water transport was rapid in freshly isolated choroid plexus from wildtype mice as measured by a spatial-filtering optical method, and reduced by 5-fold by AQP1 deletion. CSF production, an isosmolar fluid secretion process, was measured by a dye dilution method involving fluid collections using a second microneedle introduced into the cisterna magna. CSF production in wildtype mice was (in microl/min) 0.37 +/- 0.04 microl/min (control), 0.16 +/- 0.03 microl/min (acetazolamide-treated) and 1.14 +/- 0.15 microl/min (forskolin-treated), and reduced by up to 25% in AQP1 null mice. The impaired CSF production in AQP1 null mice provides direct functional evidence for the involvement of AQP1 in CSF formation.
17065073	Adenosine kinase from rat liver: new biochemical properties.	Adenosine kinase is a well-known enzyme which catalyzes the phosphorylation of adenosine to AMP: Its metabolic and kinetic properties are well studied. Here, we report new properties of rat liver enzyme, demonstrating a new reaction: ADP can be a phosphate donor instead ATP, according to the reaction: adenosine + ADP --> 2AMP) demonstrating the efficiency of AdK to phosphorylate adenosine, also starting from ADP. Cells could exploited this property in situations in which ATP levels are strongly decreased and ADP decreases slowly.
20517484	The role of rasagiline in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.	Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting 1% to 2% of people older than 60 years. Treatment of PD consists of symptomatic therapies while neuroprotective strategies have remained elusive. Rasagiline is a novel, potent, and irreversible monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) inhibitor which has been approved for treatment of PD. Rasagiline inhibits MAO-B more potently than selegiline and has the advantage of once-daily dosing. In several large, randomized, placebo-controlled trials, rasagiline has demonstrated efficacy as monotherapy in early PD and as adjunctive therapy in advanced PD. In addition, rasagiline has been shown to have neuroprotective effects in in vitro and in vivo studies. The recently completed delayed-start ADAGIO (Attenuation of Disease Progression with Azilect Given Once-daily) trial suggests a potential disease-modifying effect for rasagiline 1 mg/day, though the clinical import of this finding has yet to be established.
23216335	Platelet-derived microparticles in overweight/obese women with the polycystic ovary syndrome.	A substantial proportion of women with the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are obese and obesity is considered as a prothrombotic state. Platelet-derived microparticles (PMPs) might be implicated in the activation of the coagulation cascade. We aimed to assess plasma PMPs in overweight/obese women with PCOS. We measured plasma PMPs and determined anthropometric, metabolic, hormonal and ultrasonographic features of PCOS in 67 overweight/obese women with PCOS (with body mass index [BMI] >25.0 kg/m(2)) and in 21 BMI-matched healthy women. Circulating androgens and markers of insulin resistance (IR) were higher in women with PCOS than in controls. Plasma PMPs were also higher in women with PCOS than in controls (p = 0.046). In women with PCOS, plasma PMPs correlated with the mean number of follicles in the ovaries (r = 0.343; p = 0.006). In controls, plasma PMPs did not correlate with any of the studied parameters. In conclusion, plasma PMPs are elevated in overweight/obese women with PCOS compared with BMI-matched controls. The cause of this increase is unclear but both IR and hyperandrogenemia might be implicated. More studies are required to elucidate the pathogenesis of the elevation of PMPs in PCOS and to assess its implications on the cardiovascular risk of these patients.
17327402	Fatal hemorrhage in mice lacking gamma-glutamyl carboxylase.	The carboxylation of glutamic acid residues to gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) by the vitamin K-dependent gamma-glutamyl carboxylase (gamma-carboxylase) is an essential posttranslational modification required for the biological activity of a number of proteins, including proteins involved in blood coagulation and its regulation. Heterozygous mice carrying a null mutation at the gamma-carboxylase (Ggcx) gene exhibit normal development and survival with no evidence of hemorrhage and normal functional activity of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors IX, X, and prothrombin. Analysis of a Ggcx(+/-) intercross revealed a partial developmental block with only 50% of expected Ggcx(-/-) offspring surviving to term, with the latter animals dying uniformly at birth of massive intra-abdominal hemorrhage. This phenotype closely resembles the partial midembryonic loss and postnatal hemorrhage previously reported for both prothrombin- and factor V (F5)-deficient mice. These data exclude the existence of a redundant carboxylase pathway and suggest that functionally critical substrates for gamma-carboxylation, at least in the developing embryo and neonate, are primarily restricted to components of the blood coagulation cascade.
12826150	"Calcineurin-free protocols with basiliximab induction allow patients included in ""old to old"" programs achieve standard kidney transplant function."	"INTRODUCTION: The EuroTransplant ""old to old"" program establishes that patients older than 60 years can receive offers of organs from donors older than 60 years. The compromised function of these organs makes it a priority to preserve their initial kidney function. HYPOTHESIS: Calcineurin-sparing protocols using anti-IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) antibody induction (Simulect) may benefit initial kidney function in these patients, as assessed by the rates of delayed graft function and of rejection during the first month after transplant. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cohort of 15 consecutive elderly patients were prospectively compared with 30 cadaveric kidney transplants in younger recipients. Study patients were induced with Simulect (20 mg, 30 minutes before reperfusion and 4 days after transplantation) and steroids, delaying the introduction of CsA until the serum creatinine was below 3 mg/dL. The other cohort of patients were immunosuppressed with tacrolimus (trough 8 to 12), mycophenolats mofetil (MMF, 1 g/d), and an identical taper of steroids. The analysis compared donor and recipient ages, mean cold ischemic time, incidence of initial kidney function (diuresis in the first 24 h) serum creatinine levels, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), number of dialysis sessions, and rejection rate in the two groups. RESULTS: Except for the donor and recipient ages (72 vs 54 in donors, and 67 versus 52 years in recipients), no significant differences were observed between the groups among the rates of acute rejection (6.6% vs 13.2%), delayed graft function (13.2% required dialysis), or infection (6.6%). Within 1 month all 45 grafts showed primary function with equal creatinine levels (mean 1.65). CONCLUSIONS: Calcineurin-free protocols using IL-2 therapy as the initial suppression allow patients in the ""old to old"" ET program to display equal results to cadaveric kidney transplants with initial treatment with calcineurin antagonists."
23314046	Identification of novel antimycobacterial chemical agents through the in silico multi-conformational structure-based drug screening of a large-scale chemical library.	The increasing prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis, which is resistant to effective multiple antibiotic, presents a major global health threat. The thymidine monophosphate kinase (TMPK) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis), which is an essential enzyme for the maintenance of the thymidine triphosphate pools, is considered an attractive target for the development of effective antibiotics against tuberculosis. In this study, we attempted to identify novel chemical compounds that specifically target the M. tuberculosis TMPK (mtTMPK). We performed in silico structure-based drug screening using the crystal structure data of mtTMPK and a large-scale virtual compound library, which is composed of 6,192,930 chemicals. Through a three-step screening method using the DOCK and GOLD, we identified ten chemical compounds that were predicted to have high binding affinity to the active site cleft of the mtTMPK. We then evaluated the antibiotic effects of these chemical compounds on model mycobacteria strains. As a result, we found that a chemical compound, K10, completely inhibited the growth of Mycobacterium vanbaalenii (M. vanbaalenii) and Mycobacterium smegmatis (M. smegmatis). Moreover, K10 does not exhibit any toxic effects on the growth of enterobacteria and mammalian cells. The structural and experimental information regarding this novel chemical compound, K10, is likely to be useful for the hit-to-lead optimization of new antibiotics for the treatment of tuberculosis.
23401472	Epigenetic Regulation Is a Crucial Factor in the Repression of UGT1A1 Expression in the Human Kidney.	Human UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 catalyzes the metabolism of numerous clinically and pharmacologically important compounds such as bilirubin and SN-38. UGT1A1 is predominantly expressed in the liver and intestine, but not in the kidney. The purpose of this study was to uncover the mechanism of the tissue-specific expression of UGT1A1, focusing on its epigenetic regulation. Bisulfite sequence analysis revealed that the CpG-rich region near the UGT1A1 promoter (-85 to +40) was hypermethylated (83%) in the kidney, whereas it was hypomethylated (37%) in the liver. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that histone H3 near the promoter was hypoacetylated in the kidney but was hyperacetylated in the liver; this hyperacetylation was accompanied by the recruitment of HNF1α to the promoter. The UGT1A1 promoter in human kidney-derived HK-2 cells that do not express UGT1A1 was fully methylated, but was relatively unmethylated in human liver-derived HuH-7 cells that express UGT1A1. Treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC), an inhibitor of DNA methylation, resulted in an increase of UGT1A1 mRNA expression in both cell types, but the increase was much larger in HK-2 cells than in HuH-7 cells. The transfection of an HNF1α expression plasmid into the HK-2 cells resulted in an increase of UGT1A1 mRNA only in the presence of 5-Aza-dC. In summary, we found that DNA hypermethylation along with histone hypoacetylation interferes with the binding of HNF1α, resulting in the defective expression of UGT1A1 in the human kidney. Thus, epigenetic regulation is a crucial determinant of tissue-specific expression of UGT1A1.
23408116	The UDP-Glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A Polymorphism c.2042C>G (rs8330) Is Associated with Increased Human Liver Acetaminophen Glucuronidation, Increased UGT1A Exon 5a/5b Splice Variant mRNA Ratio, and Decreased Risk of Unintentional Acetaminophen-Induced Acute Liver Failure.	Acetaminophen is cleared primarily by hepatic glucuronidation. Polymorphisms in genes encoding the acetaminophen UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes could explain interindividual variability in acetaminophen glucuronidation and variable risk for liver injury after acetaminophen overdose. In this study, human liver bank samples were phenotyped for acetaminophen glucuronidation activity and genotyped for the major acetaminophen-glucuronidating enzymes (UGTs 1A1, 1A6, 1A9, and 2B15). Of these, only three linked single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the shared UGT1A-3'UTR region (rs10929303, rs1042640, rs8330) were associated with acetaminophen glucuronidation activity, with rs8330 consistently showing higher acetaminophen glucuronidation at all the tested concentrations of acetaminophen. Mechanistic studies using luciferase-UGT1A-3'UTR reporters indicated that these SNPs do not alter mRNA stability or translation efficiency. However, there was evidence for allelic imbalance and a gene-dose proportional increase in the amount of exon 5a versus exon 5b containing UGT1A mRNA spliced transcripts in livers with the rs8330 variant allele. Cotransfection studies demonstrated an inhibitory effect of exon 5b containing cDNAs on acetaminophen glucuronidation by UGT1A1 and UGT1A6 cDNAs containing exon 5a. In silico analysis predicted that rs8330 creates an exon splice enhancer site that could favor exon 5a (over exon 5b) utilization during splicing. Finally, the prevalence of rs8330 was significantly lower (P = 0.027, χ(2) test) in patients who had acute liver failure from unintentional acetaminophen overdose compared with patients with acute liver failure from other causes or a race- or ethnicity-matched population. Together, these findings suggest that rs8330 is an important determinant of acetaminophen glucuronidation and could affect an individual's risk for acetaminophen-induced liver injury.
17603759	L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria, a defect of metabolite repair.	L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria is a metabolic disorder in which L-2-hydroxyglutarate accumulates as a result of a deficiency in FAD-linked L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase, a mitochondrial enzyme converting L-2-hydroxyglutarate to alpha-ketoglutarate. The origin of the L-2-hydroxyglutarate, which accumulates in this disorder, is presently unknown. The oxidation-reduction potential of the 2-hydroxyglutarate/alpha-ketoglutarate couple is such that L-2-hydroxyglutarate could potentially be produced through the reduction of alpha-ketoglutarate by a NAD- or NADP-linked oxidoreductase. In fractions of rat liver cytosolic extracts that had been chromatographed on an anion exchanger we detected an enzyme reducing alpha-ketoglutarate in the presence of NADH. This enzyme co-purified with cytosolic L-malate dehydrogenase (cMDH) upon further chromatography on Blue Sepharose. Mitochondrial fractions also contained an NADH-linked, 'alpha-ketoglutarate reductase', which similarly co-purified with mitochondrial L-malate dehydrogenase (mMDH). Purified mMDH catalysed the reduction of alpha-ketoglutarate to L-2-hydroxyglutarate with a catalytic efficiency that was about 10(7)-fold lower than that observed with oxaloacetate. For the cytosolic enzyme, this ratio amounted to 10(8), indicating that this enzyme is more specific. Both cMDH and mMDH are highly active in tissues and alpha-ketoglutarate is much more abundant than oxaloacetate and more concentrated in mitochondria than in the cytosol. As a result of this, the weak activity of mMDH on alpha-ketoglutarate is sufficient to account for the amount of L-2-hydroxyglutarate that is excreted by patients deficient in FAD-linked L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase. The latter enzyme appears, therefore, to be responsible for a 'metabolite repair' phenomenon and to belong to the expanding class of 'house-cleaning' enzymes.
23386394	PHI: A powerful new program for the analysis of anisotropic monomeric and exchange-coupled polynuclear d- and f-block complexes.	A new program, PHI, with the ability to calculate the magnetic properties of large spin systems and complex orbitally degenerate systems, such as clusters of d-block and f-block ions, is presented. The program can intuitively fit experimental data from multiple sources, such as magnetic and spectroscopic data, simultaneously. PHI is extensively parallelized and can operate under the symmetric multiprocessing, single process multiple data, or GPU paradigms using a threaded, MPI or GPU model, respectively. For a given problem PHI is been shown to be almost 12 times faster than the well-known program MAGPACK, limited only by available hardware. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
23266270	Anti-inflammatory effects of trans-1,3-diphenyl-2,3-epoxypropane-1-one mediated by suppression of inflammatory mediators in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages.	To assess the potential therapeutic properties of trans-1,3-diphenyl-2,3-epoxypropane-1-one (DPEP), its anti-inflammatory effects were investigated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated mouse macrophage (RAW 264.7) cells. DPEP induced dose-dependent reduction of the protein levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and concomitant reduction in the production of NO and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)). Additionally, DPEP suppressed the production of inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6. We investigated the mechanism by which DPEP inhibits NO and PGE(2) by examining the level of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation within the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which is an inflammation-induced signaling pathway in RAW 264.7 cells. DPEP inhibited LPS-induced phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and p38. Furthermore, DPEP inhibited the LPS-induced phosphorylation of inhibitor κB (IκB)-α and NF-κB p50. Taken together, the results of this study demonstrate that DPEP inhibits LPS-stimulated inflammation by blocking the NF-κB and MAPK pathways in macrophages.
23376608	Apigenin induces c-Myc-mediated apoptosis in FRO anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cells.	Apigenin promotes apoptosis in cancer cells. We studied the effect of apigenin on cell survival and c-Myc expression in FRO anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) cells. Apigenin caused apoptosis via the elevation of c-Myc levels in conjunction with the phosphorylation of p38 and p53. In the c-Myc siRNA-transfected and apigenin-treated cells, compared with the apigenin-treated control cells, apoptosis and phosphorylation of p38 and p53 were ameliorated. In the presence of apigenin, diminution of p38 and p53 did not affect cell survival although apigenin activated the phosphorylation of p38 and p53 via increased c-Myc levels. In conclusion, our results indicate that apigenin induces apoptosis mediated via c-Myc with concomitant phosphorylation of p53 and p38 in FRO ATC cells. These findings suggest that augmented c-Myc acts as a core regulator and is necessary for apigenin-induced apoptosis in FRO ATC cells.
23122072	An improved mass spectrometric method for identification and quantification of phenolic compounds in apple fruits.	Thirty-nine phenolic compounds were analysed using ultra high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with diode array and accurate mass spectrometry detection using electrospray ionisation (DAD/ESI-am-MS). Instrumental parameters such as scan speed, resolution, and mass accuracy were optimised to establish accurate mass measurements. The method was fully validated in terms of model deviation (r(2)>0.9990), range (typically 10-3500 ngg(-1)), intra/inter-day precision (<6% and <8%, respectively) and accuracy (typically 100 ± 10%). The mass accuracy of each selected phenolic compound was below 1.5 ppm. The results confirmed that the UHPLC-DAD/ESI-am-MS method developed here was convenient and reliable for the determination of phenolic compounds in apple extracts.
11246672	Minocycline inhibits the production of inducible nitric oxide synthase in articular chondrocytes.	OBJECTIVE: To determine the in vitro effects of tetracyclines and nonsteroidal antiiflammatory drugs on interleukin 1alpha (IL-1alpha) induced NO production and biosynthesis of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) by articular chondrocytes. METHODS: Bovine chondrocytes were cultured in alginate beads. Cells were treated with IL-lalpha in the presence or absence of drugs at various concentrations. Expression of mRNA for iNOS was analyzed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-ELISA. Protein synthesis of iNOS was determined by immunoprecipitation. NO production was taken as a measure for the activity of the enzyme. RESULTS: Minocycline dose dependently reduced IL-1 stimulated NO production by inhibition of the mRNA expression (IC50 = 69.9 microM) and protein synthesis (IC50 = 37.11 microM) of iNOS. Diclofenac-Na at a concentration of 10 microM only weakly reduced nitrite accumulation and mRNA expression of iNOS. No effects were observed for tetracycline, doxycycline, and meloxicam. CONCLUSION: Inhibition of iNOS in articular chondrocytes may be a new mechanism by which minocycline could exert its beneficial effects in the treatment of joint diseases.
14500570	Minireview: malonyl CoA, AMP-activated protein kinase, and adiposity.	An increasing body of evidence has linked AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and malonyl coenzyme A (CoA) to the regulation of energy balance. Thus, factors that activate AMPK and decrease the concentration of malonyl CoA in peripheral tissues, such as exercise, decrease triglyceride accumulation in the adipocyte and other cells. The data reviewed here suggest that this is related to the fact that these factors concurrently increase fatty acid oxidation, decrease the esterification of fatty acids to form glycerolipids, and, by mechanisms still unknown, increase energy expenditure. Malonyl CoA contributes to these events because it is an allosteric inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase, the enzyme that controls the transfer of long-chain fatty acyl CoA from the cytosol to the mitochondria, where they are oxidized. AMPK activation in turn increases fatty acid oxidation (by effects on enzymes that govern malonyl CoA synthesis and possibly its degradation) and inhibits triglyceride synthesis. It also increases the expression of uncoupling proteins and the transcriptional regulator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC1alpha), which could possibly increase energy expenditure. Recent studies suggest that the ability of leptin, adiponectin, 5'-aminoimidazole 4-carboxamide riboside (AICAR), adrenergic agonists, and metformin to diminish adiposity may be mediated, at least in part, by AMPK activation in peripheral tissues. In addition, preliminary studies suggest that malonyl CoA and AMPK take part in fuel-sensing and signaling mechanisms in the hypothalamus that could regulate food intake and energy expenditure.
23215461	Recombinant human fibrinogen that produces thick fibrin fibers with increased wound adhesion and clot density.	Human fibrinogen is a biomaterial used in surgical tissue sealants, scaffolding for tissue engineering, and wound healing. Here we report on the post-translational structure and functionality of recombinant human FI (rFI) made at commodity levels in the milk of transgenic dairy cows. Relative to plasma-derived fibrinogen (pdFI), rFI predominately contained a simplified, neutral carbohydrate structure and >4-fold higher levels of the γ'-chain transcriptional variant that has been reported to bind thrombin and Factor XIII. In spite of these differences, rFI and pdFI were kinetically similar with respect to the thrombin-catalyzed formation of protofibrils and Factor XIIIa-mediated formation of cross-linked fibrin polymer. However, electron microscopy showed rFI produced fibrin with much thicker fibers with less branching than pdFI. In vivo studies in a swine liver transection model showed that, relative to pdFI, rFI made a denser, more strongly wound-adherent fibrin clot that more rapidly established hemostasis.
23382458	Characterization of efflux transporters involved in distribution and disposition of apixaban.	The studies reported here were conducted to investigate the transport characteristics of apixaban (1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-7-oxo-6-(4-(2-oxopiperidin-1-yl)phenyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridine-3-carboxamide) and to understand the impact of transporters on apixaban distribution and disposition. In human permeability glycoprotein (P-gp)- and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)-cDNA-transfected cell monolayers as well as Caco-2 cell monolayers, the apparent efflux ratio of basolateral-to-apical (PcB-A) versus apical-to-basolateral permeability (PcA-B) of apixaban was >10. The P-gp- and BCRP-facilitated transport of apixaban was concentration- and time-dependent and did not show saturation over a wide range of concentrations (1-100 μM). The efflux transport of apixaban was also demonstrated by the lower mucosal-to-serosal permeability than that of the serosal-to-mucosal direction in isolated rat jejunum segments. Apixaban did not inhibit digoxin transport in Caco-2 cells. Ketoconazole decreased the P-gp-mediated apixaban efflux in Caco-2 and the P-gp-cDNA-transfected cell monolayers, but did not affect the apixaban efflux to a meaningful extent in the BCRP-cDNA-transfected cell monolayers. Coincubation of a P-gp inhibitor (ketoconazole or cyclosporin A) and a BCRP inhibitor (Ko134) provided more complete inhibition of apixaban efflux in Caco-2 cells than separate inhibition by individual inhibitors. Naproxen inhibited apixaban efflux in Caco-2 cells but showed only a minimal effect on apixaban transport in the BCRP-transfected cells. Naproxen was the first nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug that was demonstrated as a weak P-gp inhibitor. These results demonstrate that apixaban is a substrate for efflux transporters P-gp and BCRP, which can help explain its low brain penetration, and low fetal exposures and high milk excretion in rats.
3440035	Pharmacological properties of lorglumide as a member of a new class of cholecystokinin antagonists.	Derivatives of 5-(dipentylamino)-5-oxo-pentanoic acid are a new class of non-peptide cholecystokinin (CCK) antagonists. The most potent compound, D,L-4-(3,4-dichlorobenzoylamino)-5-(dipentylamino)-5-oxo-pen tanoic acid (lorglumide, CR 1409), has a great affinity for the pancreatic CCK receptors and is a competitive, specific and potent CCK antagonist on the smooth muscles of the gall bladder and ileum of the guinea pig and on the CCK-induced amylase secretion of isolated pancreatic acini. In vivo lorglumide antagonizes the contraction of the gall bladder of the guinea pig and of the dog provoked by i.v. CCK-8 or ceruletide (caerulein). It antagonizes the satiety effect of CCK-8 in the rat and is protective against ceruletide-, taurocholate- and diet-induced pancreatitis. Lorglumide is therefore a useful pharmacological tool to study the functions of CCK. For its pharmacological properties, its relatively low toxicity and because it is active also after oral administration, lorglumide is a candidate for diagnostic or therapeutic use in man when an involvement of CCK is suspected.
23401473	Interaction of silymarin flavonolignans with organic anion-transporting polypeptides.	Organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs) are multispecific transporters mediating the uptake of endogenous compounds and xenobiotics in tissues that are important for drug absorption and elimination, including the intestine and liver. Silymarin is a popular herbal supplement often used by patients with chronic liver disease; higher oral doses than those customarily used (140 mg three times/day) are being evaluated clinically. The present study examined the effect of silymarin flavonolignans on OATP1B1-, OATP1B3-, and OATP2B1-mediated transport in cell lines stably expressing these transporters and in human hepatocytes. In overexpressing cell lines, OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated estradiol-17β-glucuronide uptake and OATP2B1-mediated estrone-3-sulfate uptake were inhibited by most of the silymarin flavonolignans investigated. OATP1B1-, OATP1B3-, and OATP2B1-mediated substrate transport was inhibited efficiently by silymarin (IC50 values of 1.3, 2.2 and 0.3 µM, respectively), silybin A (IC50 values of 9.7, 2.7 and 4.5 µM, respectively), silybin B (IC50 values of 8.5, 5.0 and 0.8 µM, respectively), and silychristin (IC50 values of 9.0, 36.4, and 3.6 µM, respectively). Furthermore, silymarin, silybin A, and silybin B (100 µM) significantly inhibited OATP-mediated estradiol-17β-glucuronide and rosuvastatin uptake into human hepatocytes. Calculation of the maximal unbound portal vein concentrations/IC50 values indicated a low risk for silymarin-drug interactions in hepatic uptake with a customary silymarin dose. The extent of silymarin-drug interactions depends on OATP isoform specificity and concentrations of flavonolignans at the site of drug transport. Higher than customary doses of silymarin, or formulations with improved bioavailability, may increase the risk of flavonolignan interactions with OATP substrates in patients.
17436082	Prokinetic effects of a new ghrelin receptor agonist TZP-101 in a rat model of postoperative ileus.	Postoperative ileus (POI) is a major cause of postoperative complications and prolonged hospitalization. Ghrelin, which is the endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor, has been found to stimulate gastric motility and accelerate gastric emptying. The present study investigates whether TZP-101 (0.03-1 mg/kg i.v.), a synthetic ghrelin-receptor agonist, could improve gastrointestinal transit in rats with POI. Since the main factors for the development of POI are the surgical manipulation and the gastrointestinal effects of opioid-receptor agonists used for pain management, the effect of TZP-101 was investigated in rats subjected to surgery, to morphine treatment (3 mg/kg s.c.), or to a combination of both. The results showed that TZP-101 is equally effective against the delayed gastrointestinal transit induced by surgery, by morphine, or by the combination of both interventions. The prokinetic action of TZP-101 was more pronounced in the stomach compared to the small intestine.
23340651	Low oxygen tension maintains multipotency, whereas normoxia increases differentiation of mouse bone marrow stromal cells.	Optimization of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) culture conditions is of great importance for their more successful application in regenerative medicine. O(2) regulates various aspects of cellular biology and, in vivo, MSC are exposed to different O(2) concentrations spanning from very low tension in the bone marrow niche, to higher amounts in wounds. In our present work, we isolated mouse bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) and showed that they contained a population meeting requirements for MSC definition. In order to establish the effect of low O(2) on cellular properties, we examined BSMC cultured under hypoxic (3% O(2)) conditions. Our results demonstrate that 3% O(2) augmented proliferation of BMSC, as well as the formation of colonies in the colony-forming unit assay (CFU-A), the percentage of quiescent cells, and the expression of stemness markers Rex-1 and Oct-4, thereby suggesting an increase in the stemness of culture when exposed to hypoxia. In contrast, intrinsic differentiation processes were inhibited by 3% O(2). Overall yield of differentiation was dependent on the adjustment of O(2) tension to the specific stage of BMSC culture. Thus, we established a strategy for efficient BMSC in vitro differentiation using an initial phase of cell propagation at 3% O(2), followed by differentiation stage at 21% O(2). We also demonstrated that 3% O(2) affected BMSC differentiation in p53 and reactive oxygen species (ROS) independent pathways. Our findings can significantly contribute to the obtaining of high-quality MSC for effective cell therapy.
23201622	High levels of ephrinB2 over-expression increases the osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells and promotes enhanced cell mediated mineralisation in a polyethyleneimine-ephrinB2 gene-activated matrix.	Gene therapy can be combined with tissue engineering constructs to produce gene-activated matrices (GAMs) with enhanced capacity for repair. Polyethyleneimine (PEI), a non-viral vector, has previously been optimised for high efficiency gene transfer in rat mesenchymal stem cells (rMSCs). The use of PEI to transfect human MSCs (hMSCs) with ephrinB2 is assessed here. Recently a role for the ephrinB2 ligand and EphB4 receptor duo has been proposed in bone remodelling. Herein, over-expression of the ephrinB2 ligand resulted in increased osteogenic differentiation in hMSCs. As ephrinB2 is a cell surface anchored ligand which only interacts with cells expressing the cognate EphB4 receptor through direct contact, we have shown that direct cell-cell contact between two neighbouring cells is responsible for enhanced osteogenesis. In an effort to begin to elucidate the molecular mechanisms at play downstream of ephrinB2 over-expression, RT-PCR was performed on the GAMs which revealed no significant changes in runx2 or BMP2 expression but an upregulation of osterix (Osx) and Dlx5 expression prompting the belief that the mode of osteogenesis is independent of the BMP2 pathway. This select interaction, coupled with the transient gene expression profile of PEI, makes the PEI-ephrinB2 GAM an ideal candidate matrix for a bone targeted GAM.
17259370	Rosiglitazone inhibits acyl-CoA synthetase activity and fatty acid partitioning to diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol via a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma-independent mechanism in human arterial smooth muscle cells and macrophages.	Rosiglitazone is an insulin-sensitizing agent that has recently been shown to exert beneficial effects on atherosclerosis. In addition to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma, rosiglitazone can affect other targets, such as directly inhibiting recombinant long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (ACSL)-4 activity. Because it is unknown if ACSL4 is expressed in vascular cells involved in atherosclerosis, we investigated the ability of rosiglitazone to inhibit ACSL activity and fatty acid partitioning in human and murine arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and macrophages. Human and murine SMCs and human macrophages expressed Acsl4, and rosiglitazone inhibited Acsl activity in these cells. Furthermore, rosiglitazone acutely inhibited partitioning of fatty acids into phospholipids in human SMCs and inhibited fatty acid partitioning into diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol in human SMCs and macrophages through a PPAR-gamma-independent mechanism. Conversely, murine macrophages did not express ACSL4, and rosiglitazone did not inhibit ACSL activity in these cells, nor did it affect acute fatty acid partitioning into cellular lipids. Thus, rosiglitazone inhibits ACSL activity and fatty acid partitioning in human and murine SMCs and in human macrophages through a PPAR-gamma-independent mechanism likely to be mediated by ACSL4 inhibition. Therefore, rosiglitazone might alter the biological effects of fatty acids in these cells and in atherosclerosis.
23146838	Influence of ovarian and non-ovarian estrogens on weight gain in response to disruption of sweet taste--calorie relations in female rats.	Regulation of energy balance in female rats is known to differ along a number of dimensions compared to male rats. Previous work from our lab has demonstrated that in female rats fed dietary supplements containing high-intensity sweeteners that may disrupt a predictive relation between sweet tastes and calories, excess weight gain is demonstrated only when females are also fed a diet high in fat and sugar, and is evidenced primarily in animals already prone to gain excess weight. In contrast, male rats show excess weight gain when fed saccharin-sweetened yogurt supplements when fed both standard chow diets and diets high in fat and sugar, and regardless of their proneness to excess weight gain. The goal of the present experiments was to determine whether ovarian, or other sources of estrogens, contributes to the resistance to excess weight gain in female rats fed standard chow diets along with dietary supplements sweetened with yogurt. Results of the first experiment indicated that when the ovaries were removed surgically in adult female rats, patterns of weight gain were similar in animals fed saccharin-sweetened compared to glucose-sweetened yogurt supplements. In the second experiment, when the ovaries were surgically removed in adult female rats, and local production of estrogens was suppressed with the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole, females fed the saccharin-sweetened yogurt consumed more energy and gained more weight than females fed the glucose-sweetened yogurt. However, when the ovaries were surgically removed prior to the onset of puberty (at 24-25 days of age), females given saccharin-sweetened yogurt along with vehicle gained excess weight. In contrast, weight gain was similar in those given saccharin-sweetened and glucose-sweetened yogurt along with anastrozole. The results suggest that behavioral differences between males and females in response to disruption of sweet→calorie relations may result from differences in patterns of local estrogen production. These differences may be established developmentally during the pubertal period in females.
23333908	Hibiscus sabdariffa L. in the treatment of hypertension and hyperlipidemia: a comprehensive review of animal and human studies.	The effectiveness of Hibiscus sabdariffa L. (HS) in the treatment of risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease is assessed in this review by taking a comprehensive approach to interpreting the randomized clinical trial (RCT) results in the context of the available ethnomedical, phytochemical, pharmacological, and safety and toxicity information. HS decoctions and infusions of calyxes, and on occasion leaves, are used in at least 10 countries worldwide in the treatment of hypertension and hyperlipidemia with no reported adverse events or side effects. HS extracts have a low degree of toxicity with a LD50 ranging from 2,000 to over 5,000mg/kg/day. There is no evidence of hepatic or renal toxicity as the result of HS extract consumption, except for possible adverse hepatic effects at high doses. There is evidence that HS acts as a diuretic, however in most cases the extract did not significantly influence electrolyte levels. Animal studies have consistently shown that consumption of HS extract reduces blood pressure in a dose dependent manner. In RCTs, the daily consumption of a tea or extract produced from HS calyxes significantly lowered systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in adults with pre to moderate essential hypertension and type 2 diabetes. In addition, HS tea was as effective at lowering blood pressure as the commonly used blood pressure medication Captropril, but less effective than Lisinopril. Total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides were lowered in the majority of normolipidemic, hyperlipidemic, and diabetic animal models, whereas high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was generally not affected by the consumption of HS extract. Over half of the RCTs showed that daily consumption of HS tea or extracts had favorable influence on lipid profiles including reduced total cholesterol, LDL-C, triglycerides, as well as increased HDL-C. Anthocyanins found in abundance in HS calyxes are generally considered the phytochemicals responsible for the antihypertensive and hypocholesterolemic effects, however evidence has also been provided for the role of polyphenols and hibiscus acid. A number of potential mechanisms have been proposed to explain the hypotensive and anticholesterol effects, but the most common explanation is the antioxidant effects of the anthocyanins inhibition of LDL-C oxidation, which impedes atherosclerosis, an important cardiovascular risk factor. This comprehensive body of evidence suggests that extracts of HS are promising as a treatment of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, however more high quality animal and human studies informed by actual therapeutic practices are needed to provide recommendations for use that have the potential for widespread public health benefit.
23592595	An in Vivo Tagging Method Reveals that Ras Undergoes Sustained Activation upon Transglutaminase-Mediated Protein Serotonylation.	Don't interrupt! Protein serotonylation has been implicated in living cells, yet its role remains poorly defined because of the lack of characterization tools. We synthesized a serotonin derivative to enable selective tagging of serotonylation and to investigate its effect on Ras; the latter displayed undisrupted interaction with Raf-1 at the Ras binding domain.
8626538	Molecular cloning of a novel diacylglycerol kinase isozyme with a pleckstrin homology domain and a C-terminal tail similar to those of the EPH family of protein-tyrosine kinases.	A fourth member of the diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) gene family termed DGK delta was cloned from the human testis cDNA library. The cDNA sequence contains an open reading frame of 3,507 nucleotides encoding a putative DGK protein of 130,006 Da. Interestingly, the new DGK isozyme contains a pleckstrin homology domain found in a number of proteins involved in signal transduction. Furthermore, the C-terminal tail of this isozyme is very similar to those of the EPH family of receptor tyrosine kinases. The primary structure of the delta-isozyme also has two cysteine-rich zinc finger-like structures (C3 region) and the C-terminal C4 region, both of which have been commonly found in the three isozymes previously cloned (DGKs alpha, beta and gamma). However, DGK delta lacks the EF-hand motifs (C2) and contains a long Glu- and Ser-rich insertion (317 residues), which divides the C4 region into two portions. Taken together, these structural features of DGK delta indicate that this isozyme belongs to a DGK subfamily distinct from that consisting of DGKs alpha, beta, and gamma. Increased DGK activity without marked preference to arachidonoyl type of diacylglycerol was detected in the particulate fraction of COS-7 cells expressing the transfected DGKdelta cDNA. The enzyme activity was independent of phosphatidylserine, which is a common activator for the previously sequenced DGKs. Northern blot analysis showed that the DGK delta mRNA (approximately 6.3 kilobases) is most abundant in human skeletal muscle but undetectable in the brain, thymus, and retina. This expression pattern is different from those of the previously cloned DGKs. Our results show that the DGK gene family consists of at least two subfamilies consisting of enzymes with distinct structural characteristics and that each cell type probably expresses its own characteristic repertoire of DGKs whose functions may be regulated through different signal transduction pathways.
23386390	Add-on therapy with the DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin improves glycemic control in insulin-treated Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.	The effect of add-on therapy with sitagliptin on glycemic control was prospectively investigated in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) receiving insulin alone or insulin combined with oral antidiabetic drugs. Seventy-one patients were evaluated (38 men and 33 women aged 63.9±10.2 years). They were divided into three groups, which were 45 patients receiving premixed insulin twice daily, 15 patients receiving multiple daily insulin injections, and 11 patients receiving basal insulin with oral antidiabetic drugs (basal insulin therapy). Concomitant oral drugs included sulfonylureas, α-glucosidase inhibitors and metformin. The hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of all patients improved significantly from 8.1±1.2% to 7.6±1.1% after 12 weeks of add-on therapy with sitagliptin (p<0.01), and the insulin dosage was reduced from 27.3±15.8 U/day to 24.5±16.5 U/day (p<0.001). Body weight did not change after the start of concomitant therapy and severe hypoglycemia was not observed. The baseline HbA1c and glycated albumin levels were identified as factors that predicted the response to add-on therapy with sitagliptin. These findings suggest that add-on therapy with sitagliptin can be expected to achieve improvement of poor glycemic control irrespective of a patient's demographic profile. Stratified analysis based on the insulin regimen revealed a stronger antidiabetic effect and a high efficacy of sitagliptin when it was added to basal insulin therapy. The results of this investigation confirmed that add-on therapy with sitagliptin to various insulin regimens could improve glycemic control without severe hypoglycemia and/or weight gain.
18073378	Extended adjuvant therapy with anastrozole among postmenopausal breast cancer patients: results from the randomized Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group Trial 6a.	BACKGROUND: Clinical trial data have shown that among breast cancer patients who were disease free after 5 years of adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen, further extended treatment with the nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor letrozole reduces breast cancer recurrence. We examined the efficacy and tolerability of extended adjuvant therapy with another aromatase inhibitor, anastrozole, for 3 years among women who had completed 5 years of adjuvant therapy. METHODS: Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group (ABCSG) Trial 6a is an extension of ABCSG Trial 6, in which hormone receptor-positive postmenopausal patients received 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen, with or without the aromatase inhibitor aminoglutethimide, for the first 2 years of therapy. For ABCSG Trial 6a, patients who were disease free at the end of Trial 6 were randomly assigned to receive either 3 years of anastrozole or no further treatment. Efficacy data were analyzed with the use of a Cox proportional hazards regression model with two-sided P values and Kaplan-Meier curves, and tolerability data were estimated using logistic regression analysis with odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: ABCSG Trial 6a included 856 patients. At a median follow-up of 62.3 months, women who received anastrozole (n = 387) had a statistically significantly reduced risk of recurrence (locoregional recurrence, contralateral breast cancer, or distant metastasis) compared with women who received no further treatment (n = 469; hazard ratio = 0.62; 95% CI = 0.40 to 0.96, P = .031). Anastrozole was well tolerated, and no unexpected adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm the benefit of extending adjuvant tamoxifen therapy beyond 5 years with anastrozole compared with no further treatment. Further research is required to define the optimum length of extended adjuvant therapy and to investigate the possibility of tailoring this period to suit different disease types.
17645691	Multiple protective effects of melatonin against maternal cholestasis-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in the rat fetal liver-placenta-maternal liver trio.	Maternal cholestasis is usually a benign condition for the mother but induces profound placental damage and may be lethal for the fetus. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects in rat maternal and fetal livers as also the placenta of melatonin or silymarin against the oxidative stress and apoptosis induced by maternal obstructive cholestasis during the last third of pregnancy (OCP). Melatonin or silymarin administration (i.e. 5 mg/100 g bw/day after ligation of the maternal common bile duct on day 14 of pregnancy) reduced OCP-induced lipid peroxidation, and prevented decreases in total glutathione levels. However, the protective effect on OCP-induced impairment in the GSH/GSSG ratio was mild in the placenta and fetal liver, while absent in maternal liver. Melatonin or silymarin also reduced OCP-induced signs of apoptosis (increased caspase-3 activity and Bax-alpha upregulation) in all the organs assayed. Moreover, melatonin (but not silymarin) upregulated several proteins involved in the cellular protection against the oxidative stress in rats with OCP. These included, biliverdin-IX alpha reductase and the sodium-dependent vitamin C transport proteins SVCT1 and SVCT2, whose expression levels were enhanced in maternal and fetal liver by melatonin treatment. In contrast, in placenta only biliverdin-IX alpha reductase and SVCT2 were upregulated. These results indicate that whereas the treatment of cholestatic pregnant rats with melatonin or silymarin affords a direct protective antioxidant activity, only melatonin has dual beneficial effects against OCP-induced oxidative challenge in that it stimulates the expression of some components of the endogenous cellular antioxidant defense.
23063590	Artemisinic acid inhibits melanogenesis through downregulation of C/EBP α-dependent expression of HMG-CoA reductase gene.	Cholesterol is associated with the regulation of melanogenesis which is the major physiological defense against solar irradiation. The present study was designed to determine the effects of artemisinic acid on melanogenesis and its mechanisms of action in human epidermal melanocytes. In this study, we found that artemisinic acid inhibited melanin content. The mRNA levels of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and its downstream genes tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein (TRP)-1, and TRP-2 were reduced by artemisinic acid treatment. Additionally, the mRNA levels of melanogenesis-related genes (c-KIT, stem cell factor (SCF), and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF)) were down-regulated by artemisinic acid. Furthermore, cAMP production and protein kinase A (PKA) activity were suppressed by artemisinic acid. Moreover, attempts to elucidate a possible mechanism underlying the artemisinic acid-mediated effects revealed that artemisinic acid regulated melanogenesis by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis through downregulation of the hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA (HMG CoA) reductase gene, which was mediated through reduced expression of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) α gene. Taken together, these findings indicate that the inhibition of melanogenesis by artemisinic acid occurs through reduced expression of the HMG CoA reductase gene, which is mediated by C/EBP α inhibition and suggest that artemisinic acid may be useful as a hyperpigmentation inhibitor.
23385219	Integrated analysis of transcriptomics and metabonomics profiles in aflatoxin B1-induced hepatotoxicity in rat.	The aim of this work was to identify mechanisms and potential biomarkers for predicting the development and progression of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)-induced acute hepatotoxicity. In this study, microarray analysis and metabolites profiles were used to identify shifts in gene expression and metabolite levels associated with the affected physiological processes of rats treated with AFB1. Histopathological examinations and serum biochemical analysis were simultaneously performed; the results indicated that hepatotoxicity occurred in higher dosage groups. However, gene expression analysis and metabolite profiles are more sensitive than general toxicity studies for detecting AFB1-induced acute hepatotoxicity as the patterns of low-dose AFB1-treated rats in these two technique platforms were more similar to the rats in higher dosage groups than to the control rats. Integrated analysis of the results from general toxicity studies, transcriptomics and metabonomics profiles suggested that p53 signaling pathway induced by oxidative damage was the crucial step in AFB1-induced acute hepatotoxicity, whereas gluconeogenesis and lipid metabolism disorder were found to be the major metabolic effects after acute AFB1 exposure. The genes and metabolites significantly affected in common in rat liver or serum of three doses AFB1 treatments served as potential biomarkers for detecting AFB1-induced acute hepatotoxicity.
17352828	A pilot study of IL-1 inhibition by anakinra in acute gout.	Monosodium urate crystals stimulate monocytes and macrophages to release IL-1beta through the NALP3 component of the inflammasome. The effectiveness of IL-1 inhibition in hereditary autoinflammatory syndromes with mutations in the NALP3 protein suggested that IL-1 inhibition might also be effective in relieving the inflammatory manifestations of acute gout. The effectiveness of IL-1 inhibition was first evaluated in a mouse model of monosodium urate crystal-induced inflammation. IL-1 inhibition prevented peritoneal neutrophil accumulation but TNF blockade had no effect. Based on these findings, we performed a pilot, open-labeled study (trial registration number ISRCTN10862635) in 10 patients with gout who could not tolerate or had failed standard antiinflammatory therapies. All patients received 100 mg anakinra daily for 3 days. All 10 patients with acute gout responded rapidly to anakinra. No adverse effects were observed. IL-1 blockade appears to be an effective therapy for acute gouty arthritis. The clinical findings need to be confirmed in a controlled study.
7601910	Altered gene expression in murine branchial arches following in utero exposure to retinoic acid.	Retinoic acid (RA) in the form of isotretinoin (Accutane) and tretinoin (Retin-A) is a clinically important compound in the treatment of dermatologic disorders. However, it is also a potent teratogen associated with a number of serious congenital malformations. Generally, these malformations involve the craniofacial structures derived from the first and second branchial arches. To determine how altered gene expression may contribute to the observed RA-induced defects, pregnant LM/Bc mice were administered (5 mg/kg) all-trans RA on gestational day (GD) 8:12. First and second branchial arches were removed from control and teratogen-treated embryos on GD 10:00 10:12, or 12:00, processed by in situ transcription/aRNA techniques, and analyzed for alterations in gene expression. In these studies, a panel of 40 candidate genes that are known to be important in mammalian craniofacial development were examined. This analysis revealed significant differences in the expression level of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha (NAChR), transforming growth factor beta 2 (TGF beta 2), type 1 cellular retinoid binding protein (CRBP-1), retinoic acid receptor gamma (RAR gamma), and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). The alterations observed in the expression of these genes following RA exposure may prohibit normal morphogenetic processes within the second branchial arch and lead to the observed malformations.
6150080	Amine oxidase activities in brown adipose tissue of the rat: identification of semicarbazide-sensitive (clorgyline-resistant) activity at the fat cell membrane.	Amine oxidase activity, previously described in homogenates of brown adipose tissue of the rat, has now been investigated in preparations of isolated fat cells. It was found that the specific activities of both monoamine oxidase A (MAO) and of the semicarbazide-sensitive clorgyline-resistant amine oxidase (SSAO) were higher in isolated fat cells than in the original whole tissue. Brown adipocytes therefore represent a major source of both these enzymes. In plasma membranes prepared from these isolated brown fat cells by borate extraction there was a similar enrichment of activity of SSAO and of the plasma membrane marker enzyme, phosphodiesterase I. However in preparations of cell membranes made by binding the cells to polycation-coated beads, enrichment of phosphodiesterase I activity was much greater than that of SSAO. It is suggested that the disposition of the enzyme within the cell membrane may account for the discrepancy in these results, i.e. the sidedness of the membrane may be important. Histochemical visualization of enzyme activity in whole tissue at the ultrastructural level was undertaken. Positive staining of mitochondria was achieved in the presence of the MAO substrate, tryptamine. Staining around the edges of the brown fat cells was observed with the SSAO substrates, tyramine and benzylamine. Staining was largely absent when substrate was omitted or after pretreatment with the irreversible SSAO inhibitor, hydralazine and the slowly reversible inhibitor, semicarbazide. It is not definitely proven that this staining represents sites of enzyme activity but the results are consistent with evidence from other studies indicating that SSAO in brown adipose tissue of the rat may be found predominantly at the fat cell surface.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
15639300	Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.	"Inhibitors of phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) act by increasing intracellular concentrations of cyclic AMP, which has a broad range of anti-inflammatory effects on various key effector cells involved in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The therapeutic ratio for PDE4 inhibitors is thought to be determined by selectivity on receptor subtypes for relative effects on PDE4B (anti-inflammatory) and PDE4D (emesis). The two main orally active PDE4 inhibitors in the late phase III of clinical development are cilomilast and roflumilast; the latter (and its active metabolite N-oxide) is more selective and potent with a superior therapeutic ratio. Studies on cilomilast in COPD based on bronchial biopsy material have shown a broad range of anti-inflammatory activity, and the available evidence on clinical outcomes for up to 6 months with cilomilast 15 mg twice daily and roflumilast 500 mug once daily have shown variable but significant effects on exacerbations and quality of life, with small improvements in measures of pulmonary function. Roflumilast has a better safety and tolerability profile than cilomilast, with the main adverse effects being nausea, diarrhoea, and abdominal pain. Roflumilast also has activity in asthma as assessed by its attenuation of allergen and exercise challenges, and it shows clinical efficacy equivalent to that of beclomethasone dipropionate 400 mug daily. The emerging results of clinical trials on PDE4 inhibitors in asthma and COPD should be interpreted with cautious optimism since much of the evidence has been published only in abstract form to date. The next few years should resolve important issues about the potential role of these drugs as oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy for asthma and COPD and their place in management guidelines. Ultimately, clinicians will want to know whether PDE4 inhibitors are anything more than expensive ""designer"" theophylline, the archetypal non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor."
23416065	Human serum albumin-based design of a diflunisal prodrug.	The cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, diflunisal, is used in the clinic for its anti-inflammatory activity. About 99% of a dose of diflunisal is unavailable for reaction with the target enzyme, because diflunisal strongly binds to human serum albumin (HSA). To reduce the binding affinity of diflunisal to albumin, we designed and synthesized the prodrug acetyldiflunisal. The crystal structure of HSA complexed with fatty acid and acetyldiflunisal revealed that acetyldiflunisal binds to the IIA subdomain and that upon binding, it acetylates lysine 199. Mass spectrometry confirmed that acetyldiflunisal acetylates Lys199. The acetylated albumin had twofold weaker binding affinity for diflunisal as demonstrated by fluorescence quenching. Reduced binding affinity means that diflunisal is more easily released from acetylated albumin into the circulation. Therefore, lower doses of acetyldiflunisal compared to diflunisal will be required. Taken together, our results not only provide a template for design of HSA-based prodrugs, but also pave the way toward more effective use of diflunisal in the clinic.
23298292	A design of experiments to optimize a new manufacturing process for high activity protein-containing submicron particles.	A novel method for the manufacture of protein/peptide-containing submicron particles was developed in an attempt to provide particles with increased activity while using high energy input technologies. The method consists of antisolvent co-precipitation from an aqueous solution containing both an amino acid core material (e.g. D,L-valine), and either bovine serum albumin (BSA) or lysozyme (Lys) as model proteins. The aqueous solution was added to the organic phase by means of a nebulizer to increase the total surface area of interaction for the precipitation process. Sonication proved to be an effective method to produce small particle sizes while maintaining high activity of Lys. The use of a polysorbate or sorbitan ester derivatives as stabilizers proved to be necessary to yield submicron particles. Particles with very high yields (approximately 100%) and very high activity after manufacture (approximately 100%) could be obtained. A particle size of 439.0 nm, with a yield of 48.8% and with final remaining activity of98.7% was obtained. By studying various factors using a design of experiments strategy (DoE) we were able to establish the critical controlling factors for this new method of manufacture.
16609060	Chemotherapy and targeted therapy combinations in advanced melanoma.	"For three decades, clinical trials with chemotherapy in melanoma have failed to show superiority of any one regimen over another. Dacarbazine remains the only ""standard"" agent. With response rates of <10% and median progression-free survival of 2 months or less in contemporary trials, there is a need to improve systemic therapy. Combination chemotherapy is associated with higher response rates than single-agent therapy but this has not translated into improved survival. An increasing number of potential therapeutic targets have been identified. For some, pharmacologic inhibitors are available, including sorafenib for BRAF, farnesyltransferase inhibitors for NRAS, PD-0325901 for mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase, rapamycin analogues for mammalian target of rapamycin, and agents that inhibit either vascular endothelial growth factor or its receptors. Several multitargeted kinase inhibitors have potency against the fibroblast growth factor receptor, c-kit, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor. Small-molecule inhibitors of c-met and Akt are in preclinical development. Another class of agents indirectly affect aberrant signaling, including inhibitors of chaperones and proteasomes. Several targeted agents seem to enhance the cytotoxicity of chemotherapy in preclinical models. The mechanism by which signaling inhibition might synergize with chemotherapy requires more study so that rational combinations move forward. Very few targeted agents have been studied rigorously in this fashion."
15070163	Effects of an ethanolic salix extract on the release of selected inflammatory mediators in vitro.	Salix extracts are in current use for the treatment of pain and inflammation. In order to obtain an insight into the mechanism(s) of action of the ethanolic Salix extract 1520L--which is essentially similar to an extract for which clinical studies have demonstrated analgesic effectiveness--its effects were evaluated in an established in vitro assay test system using primary human monocytes. The IC50-values obtained for the inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) reflecting cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-mediated PGE2 release were 47 microg/ml and 0.6 microg/ml, for the Salix extract 1520L and rofecoxib-like research compound L745337, respectively. There was no effect on COX-1 and COX-2 activity. The Salix extract inhibited the LPS-induced release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta and interleukin-6 with IC50-values of 180.0, 33.0 and 86.0 microg/ml, respectively. Both, salicin and salicylate, had no effect in any of the parameters. Our results indicate that Salix extract 1520L inhibits COX-2-mediated PGE2 release through compounds other than salicin or salicylate. Our data further suggest that the proprietary Salix extract is a weak inhibitor of proinflammatory cytokines.
22859660	Effects of fenofibrate, a PPAR-α ligand, on the haemodynamics of glycerol-induced renal failure in rats.	The modulating effect of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α ligand on haemodynamic effects of phenylepherine (PE), angiotensin II (AII), endothelin 1 (ET1), acetylcholine (Ach), sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and isoproterenol (ISO) were evaluated in glycerol-induced acute kidney injury in rats. The effect of PE on fenofibrate-treated animals was a dose-dependent increase in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP). For AII and ET1, MAP was also increased for the fenofibrate group but not in a dose-dependent fashion. On the medullary blood flow (MBF), while the lower doses of PE and AII increased the perfusion unit on the fenofibrate-treated group, the higher doses decreased the perfusion unit. The ET1 increased the perfusion unit on this group but not in dose-dependent fashion. The effects of PE and AII on the cortical blood flow (CBF) of fenofibrate-treated group is similar to that of MBF for the same group but not for ET1. The effect of Ach, SNP and ISO in all the groups was the decrease in MAP. ISO caused dose-dependent increase in MBF of fenofibrate-treated group. The effect of Ach, SNP and ISO on the CBF perfusion unit was that of the increase for the fenofibrate-treated group. The study showed that fenofibrate did not attenuate increased blood pressure induced by PE, AII and ET1 but caused enhanced vasodilation by Ach, SNP and ISO.
9669506	Affinities of venlafaxine and various reuptake inhibitors for the serotonin and norepinephrine transporters.	In vitro radioligand binding studies were carried out in rat brain membranes to assess the affinity of various reuptake inhibitors for the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) and the norepinephrine transporters using the selective ligands [3H]cyanoimipramine and [3H]nisoxetine, respectively. The selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors paroxetine, indalpine and fluvoxamine displayed a high affinity for the 5-HT transporter, whereas the norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor desipramine had a high affinity for the norepinephrine transporter. Duloxetine, a dual 5-HT and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, displayed a high affinity for both the 5-HT and the norepinephrine transporters. Interestingly, venlafaxine, a dual 5-HT and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, displayed only a moderate affinity for the 5-HT transporter (Ki = 74 nM) and a very low affinity for the norepinephrine transporter (Ki = 1.26 microM). The relatively low affinities of venlafaxine contrast with its potent in vivo 5-HT and norepinephrine reuptake blocking properties. These results raise the possibility that the in vivo effects on the 5-HT and norepinephrine reuptake observed with venlafaxine may not be mediated solely by its binding to the [3H]cyanoimipramine and [3H]nisoxetine binding sites.
16303771	Tissue-type plasminogen activator acts as a cytokine that triggers intracellular signal transduction and induces matrix metalloproteinase-9 gene expression.	Tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), a serine protease well known for generating plasmin, has been demonstrated to induce matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) gene expression and protein secretion in renal interstitial fibroblasts. However, exactly how tPA transduces its signal into the nucleus to control gene expression is unknown. This study investigated the mechanism by which tPA induces MMP-9 gene expression. Both wild-type and non-enzymatic mutant tPA were found to induce MMP-9 expression in rat kidney interstitial fibroblasts (NRK-49F), indicating that the actions of tPA are independent of its proteolytic activity. tPA bound to the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1) in NRK-49F cells, and this binding was competitively abrogated by the LRP-1 antagonist, the receptor-associated protein. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (PEA-13) lacking LRP-1, tPA failed to induce MMP-9 expression. Furthermore, tPA induced rapid tyrosine phosphorylation on the beta subunit of LRP-1, which was followed by the activation of Mek1 and its downstream Erk-1 and -2. Blockade of Erk-1/2 activation by the Mek1 inhibitor abolished MMP-9 induction by tPA in NRK-49F cells. Conversely, overexpression of constitutively activated Mek1 induced Erk-1/2 phosphorylation and MMP-9 expression. In mouse obstructed kidney, tPA, LRP-1, and MMP-9 were concomitantly induced in the renal interstitium. Collectively, these results suggest that besides its classical proteolytic activity, tPA acts as a cytokine that binds to the cell membrane receptor LRP-1, induces its tyrosine phosphorylation, and triggers intracellular signal transduction, thereby inducing specific gene expression in renal interstitial fibroblasts.
23334403	Almorexant effects on CYP3A4 activity studied by its simultaneous and time-separated administration with simvastatin and atorvastatin.	PURPOSE: To characterise further the previously observed cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) interaction of the dual orexin receptor antagonist almorexant. METHODS: Pharmacokinetic interactions were investigated (n = 14 healthy male subjects in two treatment groups) between almorexant at steady-state when administered either concomitantly or 2 h after administration of single doses of simvastatin (40 mg) or atorvastatin (40 mg). RESULTS: Almorexant dose-dependently increased simvastatin exposure (AUC(0-∞)) when administered concomitantly [geometric mean ratios (90 % CI): 2.5 (2.1, 2.9) (100 mg), 3.9 (3.3, 4.6) (200 mg)], but not C(max) [3.7 (3.0, 4.5) for both doses]. Time-separated administration resulted in relevant reductions of the interaction [AUC(0-∞): 1.4 (1.2, 1.7) (100 mg), 1.7 (1.5, 2.0) (200 mg); C(max): 1.5 (1.3, 1.9) (100 mg), 1.9 (1.6, 2.4) (200 mg)]. Similar results were obtained for hydroxyacid simvastatin. Independent of almorexant dose and relative time of administration, AUC(0-∞) and C(max) of atorvastatin increased (ratios ranged from 1.1 to 1.5). AUC(0-∞) and C(max) of o-hydroxy atorvastatin decreased dose-independently [AUC(0-∞): 0.8 (0.8, 0.9) (100 mg), 0.6 (0.5, 0.6) (200 mg); C(max): 0.3 (0.3, 0.4) (100 mg), 0.2 (0.2, 0.3) (200 mg)] when atorvastatin was concomitantly administered. C(max) of o-hydroxy atorvastatin slightly decreased (0.8 for both doses) following time-separated administration; AUC(0-∞) was unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas almorexant increased simvastatin exposure dose- and relative time of administration-dependently, atorvastatin exposure increased to a smaller extent and irrespective of dose and time. This suggests that the observed interaction of almorexant with simvastatin is mainly caused by intestinal CYP3A4 inhibition, whereas the interaction with atorvastatin is more due to hepatic CYP3A4 inhibition.
10978228	A gene for pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy maps to chromosome 5q31.	Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (PDE) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by generalized seizures in the first hours of life and responding only to pyridoxine hydrochloride. The pathogenesis of PDE is unknown, but an alteration in the binding of pyridoxal 5-phosphate to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) has been postulated in patients with PDE. Results are reported for genetic linkage analyses in four families with consanguineous parents and in one family with nonconsanguineous parents. The GAD1 (2q31) and GAD2 genes (10p23) were tested and excluded. A genomewide search was subsequently performed, using microsatellite markers at an average distance of 10 cM, and the search revealed linkage of the disease-causing gene to markers on chromosome 5q31.2-q31.3 (maximum LOD score [Z(max)] 8.43 at recombination fraction [theta] 0 and Zmax=7.58 at straight theta=0 at loci D5S2017 and D5S1972, respectively). A recombination event, between loci D5S638 and D5S463, in one family defined the distal boundary, and a second recombination event between loci D5S2011 and D5S2017 in another family defined the proximal boundary of the genetic interval encompassing the PDE gene (5.1 cM). Ongoing studies may lead to the identification of the disease-causing gene.
23603058	The Fusarium toxin deoxynivalenol (DON) modulates the LPS induced acute phase reaction in pigs.	The systemic effects of the Fusarium toxin deoxynivalenol (DON) and of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) were studied in male castrated pigs (40.4±3.7kg) infused intravenously with either DON or LPS alone (100μgDON/kg/h, 7.5μg/LPS/kg/h), or together (100μgDON plus 7.5μg/LPS/kg/h). The Control group received a saline infusion (n=6/treatment, 24h observation period). An additional DON infusion did not exacerbate the clinical signs observed in LPS-infused pigs. For example, rectal temperature climaxed after 4h (40.4±0.2°C) and 5h (40.1±0.3°C), in the LPS and LPS+DON groups, respectively. Saline and DON alone did not induce an acute phase reaction as indicated by unaltered plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) while LPS caused a significant rise of both cytokines. TNF-alpha plasma peak concentrations were significantly higher in the LPS compared to the DON+LPS group (94.3±17.2ng/mL vs. 79.2±15.7ng/mL) while IL-6 climaxed earlier in the latter group (3h p.i. vs. 2h p.i.). From the tested clinical-chemical plasma characteristics the total bilirubin concentration and the ASAT activity were strongly elevated by the LPS infusion and additionally increased and decreased by DON, respectively. In conclusion, the LPS-induced effects were only marginally modified by DON.
1665782	Chronic effect of [D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin on rat brain opioid receptors.	In previous studies, we have demonstrated that chronic etorphine or [D-Ala2,D-Leu5]enkephalin (DADLE) treatment of rats results in the reduction of mu- and delta-opioid receptor binding activities as tolerance develops. As both etorphine and DADLE are relatively non-specific opioid ligands, interacting with both mu- and delta-receptors, these studies could not determine whether down-regulation of a specific receptor type occurs. Therefore, in the present studies, animals were rendered tolerant to the delta-opioid receptor-selective agonist [D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin (DPDPE), and receptor binding activities were measured. Treating Sprague-Dawley rats with increasing doses of DPDPE (80-160-240-320 micrograms/kg) i.c.v. for 1 to 4 days resulted in a time-dependent increase in the AD50 of DPDPE to elicit an antinociceptive response. When delta-receptor binding was determined by using [3H]DPDPE, a 40-50% decrease in binding in the midbrain and cortex, and 25-35% decrease in binding in the striatum were observed after 3 or 4 days of DPDPE treatment. Scatchard analysis of the [3H]DPDPE saturation binding data revealed a decrease in Bmax values and no significant change in Kd values. To our surprise, when mu-receptor binding was determined by using [3H]Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-MePhe-Gly-ol (DAMGO), a 10-15% decrease in binding was also observed in the midbrain and cortex after 4 days of DPDPE treatment. Our conclusion is that chronic DPDPE treatment preferentially reduces delta-opioid receptor binding activity. Its minor effect on the mu-opioid receptor maybe due to an interaction between delta cx and mu cx binding sites.
23260346	Selective inhibitors and tailored activity probes for lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A(2).	Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A(2) (Lp-PLA(2) or PLA(2)G7) binds to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, where it is thought to hydrolyze oxidatively truncated phospholipids. Lp-PLA(2) has also been implicated as a pro-tumorigenic enzyme in human prostate cancer. Several inhibitors of Lp-PLA(2) have been described, including darapladib, which is currently in phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of atherosclerosis. The selectivity that darapladib and other Lp-PLA(2) inhibitors display across the larger serine hydrolase family has not, however, been reported. Here, we describe the use of both general and tailored activity-based probes for profiling Lp-PLA(2) and inhibitors of this enzyme in native biological systems. We show that both darapladib and a novel class of structurally distinct carbamate inhibitors inactivate Lp-PLA(2) in mouse tissues and human cell lines with high selectivity. Our findings thus identify both inhibitors and chemoproteomic probes that are suitable for investigating Lp-PLA(2) function in biological systems.
23261715	Modulation of activity and inhibitor sensitivity of rabbit aldose reductase-like protein (AKR1B19) by oxidized glutathione and SH-reagents.	Rabbit aldo-keto reductase (AKR) 1B19 is an ortholog of human aldose reductase-like protein (ARLP), AKR1B10, showing 86% amino acid sequence identity. AKR1B19 exhibits the highest catalytic efficiency for 4-oxo-2-nonenal, a major product of lipid peroxidation, compared to known reductases of this aldehyde. In this study, we found that the reductase activity of AKR1B19 was activated to about 5-fold immediately after the addition of 10 μM SH-reagents (p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid and p-chloromercuribenzoic acid) in the absence or presence of NADPH. In addition, a maximum of 3-fold activation of AKR1B19 was induced by incubation with glutathione disulfide (GSSG) for 1h. The activated enzyme was converted into the native enzyme by further incubation with dithiothreitol and glutathione. The activation was abolished by the C299S mutation of AKR1B19, and the glutathionylated Cys299 was identified by mass spectrometry analysis. The Cys299-modified enzyme displayed different kinetic alterations depending on substrates and inhibitors. In the reduction of 4-oxo-2-nonenal, the catalytic efficiency was increased. Thus, AKR1B10 may be modulated by cellular ratio of GSSG/glutathione and more efficiently act as a detoxifying enzyme for the cytotoxic aldehyde under oxidatively stressed conditions. Furthermore, such an activity alteration by GSSG was not detected in AKR1B10 and rat ARLPs, suggesting the presence of a GSSG-binding site near Cys299 in AKR1B19.
9399970	Discriminative stimulus effects of the mixed-opioid agonist/antagonist dezocine: cross-substitution by mu and delta opioid agonists.	The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the discriminative stimulus effects of the mixed-opioid agonist/antagonist dezocine. In pigeons trained to discriminate 1.7 mg/kg dezocine from saline, a series of opioids with activity at the mu opioid receptor substituted completely for the dezocine stimulus with a rank order of potency similar to that obtained in other assays sensitive to the effects of mu agonists (i.e., fentanyl >[-]-cyclazocine >buprenorphine = butorphanol >l-methadone >nalbuphine >[-]-metazocine >morphine). (-)-N-allylnormetazocine and (+)-propoxyphene substituted partially for the dezocine stimulus, an effect obtained even when tested up to doses that suppressed responding. Naloxone (0.1 - 10 mg/kg) antagonized the stimulus effects of dezocine, (+)-propoxyphene and fentanyl in a dose-related manner, whereas doses of naloxone that antagonized fentanyl's rate-decreasing effects failed to antagonize the rate-decreasing effects of dezocine and (+)-propoxyphene. A 10-mg/kg dose of the mu-selective, noncompetitive antagonist beta-funaltrexamine was more effective against the stimulus effects of dezocine and nalbuphine than against morphine and fentanyl. As was observed with naloxone, beta-funaltrexamine failed to antagonize dezocine's rate-decreasing effects. The delta agonists BW373U86 and SNC80 substituted partially for the dezocine stimulus, and these effects were reversed by doses of the delta-selective antagonist naltrindole (0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg) that had no effect on the dezocine stimulus. Naltrindole also antagonized the rate-decreasing effects produced by BW373U86 and SNC80, but not those of dezocine. The kappa agonists bremazocine, spiradoline, U50,488 and U69,593 failed to substitute for the dezocine stimulus. The kappa-selective antagonist norbinaltorphimine (1.0 mg/kg) failed to antagonize dezocine's stimulus or rate-decreasing effects. The present findings indicate that dezocine shares similar stimulus effects with both mu and delta agonists, its stimulus effects are reversed by mu-selective antagonists, and its rate-decreasing effects are not mediated by activity at mu, kappa or delta opioid receptors.
23254196	Phytoestrogen genistein protects against endothelial barrier dysfunction in vascular endothelial cells through PKA-mediated suppression of RhoA signaling.	The soy-derived phytoestrogen genistein has received attention for its potential to improve vascular function, but its mechanism remains unclear. Here, we report that genistein at physiologically relevant concentrations (0.1-10 μM) significantly inhibited thrombin-induced increase in endothelial monolayer permeability. Genistein also reduced the formation of stress fibers by thrombin and suppressed thrombin-induced phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) on Ser(19)/Thr(18) in endothelial cells (ECs). Genistein had no effect on resting intracellular [Ca(2+)] or thrombin-induced increase in Ca(2+) mobilization. Addition of the inhibitors of endothelial nitric oxide synthase or estrogen receptor did not alter the protective effect of genistein. RhoA is a small GTPase that plays an important role in actin-myosin contraction and endothelial barrier dysfunction. RhoA inhibitor blocked the protective effect of genistein on endothelial permeability and also ablated thrombin-induced MLC-phosphorylation in ECs. Inhibition of PKA significantly attenuated the effect of genistein on thrombin-induced EC permeability, MLC phosphorylation, and RhoA membrane translocation in ECs. Furthermore, thrombin diminished cAMP production in ECs, which were prevented by treatment with genistein. These findings demonstrated that genistein improves thrombin-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction in ECs through PKA-mediated suppression of RhoA signaling.
17325243	Identification of a novel polymorphism in the 3'UTR of the L-arginine transporter gene SLC7A1: contribution to hypertension and endothelial dysfunction.	BACKGROUND: Endothelial dysfunction because of reduced nitric oxide bioavailability is a key feature of essential hypertension. We have found that normotensive siblings of subjects with essential hypertension have impaired endothelial function accompanied by altered arginine metabolism. METHODS AND RESULTS: We have identified a novel C/T polymorphism in the 3'UTR of the principal arginine transporter, solute carrier family 7 (cationic amino acid transporter, y+ system), member 1 gene (SLC7A1). The minor T allele significantly attenuates reporter gene expression (P<0.01) and is impaired in its capacity to form DNA-protein complexes (P<0.05). In 278 hypertensive subjects the frequency of the T allele was 13.3% compared with 7.6% in 498 normotensive subjects (P<0.001). Moreover, the overall genotype distribution observed in hypertensives differed significantly from that in normotensives (P<0.001). To complement these studies, we generated an endothelial-specific transgenic mouse overexpressing L-arginine transporter SLC7A1. The Slc7A1 transgenic mice exhibited significantly enhanced responses to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine (-log EC50 for wild-type versus Slc7A1 transgenic: 6.87+/-0.10 versus 7.56+/-0.13; P<0.001). This was accompanied by elevated production of nitric oxide by isolated aortic endothelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: The present study identifies a key, functionally active polymorphism in the 3'UTR of SLC7A1. As such, this polymorphism may account for the apparent link between altered endothelial function, L-arginine, and nitric oxide metabolism and predisposition to essential hypertension.
23265905	Design and synthesis of novel 2-methyl-4,5-substitutedbenzo[f]-3,3a,4,5-tetrahydro-pyrazolo[1,5-d][1,4]oxazepin-8(7H)-one derivatives as telomerase inhibitors.	Eight novel 4,5-tetrahydropyrazolo[1,5-d][1,4]oxazepine derivatives have been synthesized and purified to be screened for anticancer activity. By a modified TRAP assay, some titled compounds were tested against telomerase, and compound 4a showed the most potent inhibitory activity with IC(50) value at 0.78 ± 0.22 μM. Western blot assays showed that compounds 4a and 4b could inhibit expression of Cyclin D1, TERT, phospho-AKT and PI3K/AKT pathway.
17184764	Retinoids control anterior and dorsal properties in the developing forebrain.	We have previously shown that retinoic acid (RA) synthesized by the retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (RALDH2) is required in forebrain development. Deficiency in RA due to inactivation of the mouse Raldh2 gene or to complete absence of retinoids in vitamin-A-deficient (VAD) quails, leads to abnormal morphogenesis of various forebrain derivatives. In this study we show that double Raldh2/Raldh3 mouse mutants have a more severe phenotype in the craniofacial region than single null mutants. In particular, the nasal processes are truncated and the eye abnormalities are exacerbated. It has been previously shown that retinoids act mainly on cell proliferation and survival in the ventral forebrain by regulating SHH and FGF8 signaling. Using the VAD quail model, which survives longer than the Raldh-deficient mouse embryos, we found that retinoids act in maintaining the correct position of anterior and dorsal boundaries in the forebrain by modulating FGF8 anteriorly and WNT signaling dorsally. Furthermore, BMP4 and FGF8 signaling are affected in the nasal region and BMP4 is ventrally expanded in the optic vesicle. At the optic cup stage, Pax6, Tbx5 and Bmp4 are ectopically expressed in the presumptive retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), while Otx2 and Mitf are not induced, leading to a dorsal transdifferentiation of RPE to neural retina. Therefore, besides being required for survival of ventral structures, retinoids are involved in restricting anterior identity in the telencephalon and dorsal identity in the diencephalon and the retina.
23204325	Mitogen-inducible gene 6 triggers apoptosis and exacerbates ER stress-induced β-cell death.	The increased insulin secretory burden placed on pancreatic β-cells during obesity and insulin resistance can ultimately lead to β-cell dysfunction and death and the development of type 2 diabetes. Mitogen-inducible gene 6 (Mig6) is a cellular stress-responsive protein that can negatively regulate the duration and intensity of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling and has been classically viewed as a molecular brake for proliferation. In this study, we used Mig6 heterozygous knockout mice (Mig6(+/-)) to study the role of Mig6 in regulating β-cell proliferation and survival. Surprisingly, the proliferation rate of Mig6(+/-) pancreatic islets was lower than wild-type islets despite having comparable β-cell mass and glucose tolerance. We thus speculated that Mig6 regulates cellular death. Using adenoviral vectors to overexpress or knockdown Mig6, we found that caspase 3 activation during apoptosis was dependent on the level of Mig6. Interestingly, Mig6 expression was induced during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and its protein levels were maintained throughout ER stress. Using polyribosomal profiling, we identified that Mig6 protein translation was maintained, whereas the global protein translation was inhibited during ER stress. In addition, Mig6 overexpression exacerbated ER stress-induced caspase 3 activation in vitro. In conclusion, Mig6 is transcriptionally up-regulated and resistant to global translational inhibition during stressed conditions in β-cells and mediates apoptosis in the form of caspase 3 activation. The sustained production of Mig6 protein exacerbates ER stress-induced β-cell death. Thus, preventing the induction, translation, and/or function of Mig6 is warranted for increasing β-cell survival.
6701456	Demonstration of histamine receptors on human platelets by flow cytometry.	Fluoresceinated human albumin conjugated with histamine (FHA-HIS) has been used for the demonstration of histamine receptors on human platelets. Such receptors were demonstrated on 40-63% of peripheral blood platelets in 4 healthy donors. The binding of FHA-HIS was inhibited on 35-79% of the platelets by the histamine H1 receptor antagonists diphenhydramine and clemastine. The histamine H2 receptor antagonist cimetidine blocked the FHA-HIS binding on 14-37% of the platelets. It is concluded that histamine H1 as well as H2 receptors occur on human platelets but the receptors are not equally distributed in the platelet population.
15892618	Molecularly targeted therapy for gastrointestinal cancer.	Receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases (TKs) have emerged as clinically useful drug target molecules for treating gastrointestinal cancer. Imatinib mesilate (STI-571, Gleevec(TM)), an inhibitior of bcr-abl TK, which was primarily designed to treat chronic myeloid leukemia is also an inhibitor of c-kit receptor TK, and is currently the drug of choice for the therapy of metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), which frequently express constitutively activated forms of the c-kit-receptor. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is involved in cell proliferation, metastasis and angiogenesis, is another important target. The two main classes of EGFR inhibitors are the TK inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies. Gefitinib (ZD1839, Iressa(TM)) has been on trial for esophageal and colorectal cancer (CRC) and erlotinib (OSI-774, Tarceva(TM)) on trial for esophageal, colorectal, hepatocellular, and biliary carcinoma. In addition, erlotinib has been evaluated in a Phase III study for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Cetuximab (IMC-C225, Erbitux(TM)), a monoclonal EGFR antibody, has been FDA approved for the therapy of irinotecan resistant colorectal cancer and has been tested for pancreatic cancer. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor (VEGFR) are critical regulators of tumor angiogenesis. Bevacizumab (Avastin(TM)), a monoclonal antibody against VEGF, was efficient in two randomized clinical trials investigating the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. It is also currently investigated for the therapy of pancreatic cancer in combination with gemcitabine. Other promising new drugs currently under preclinical and clinical evaluation, are VEGFR2 inhibitor PTK787/ZK 222584, thalidomide, farnesyl transferase inhibitor R115777 (tipifarnib, Zarnestra(TM)), matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade(TM)), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R) inhibitors, protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) 1/2 inhibitors, Rous sarcoma virus transforming oncogene (SRC) kinase inhibitors, histondeacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, small hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) inhibitors, aurora kinase inhibitors, hedgehog inhibitors, and TGF-beta signalling inhibitors.
17544870	Alteration of gastric functions and candidate genes associated with weight reduction in response to sibutramine.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: It is unclear whether weight loss with the noradrenergic (norepinephrine) and serotonergic (5-hydroxytryptamine) reuptake inhibitor, sibutramine, is associated with altered stomach functions and whether genetics influence treatment response. METHODS: Forty-eight overweight and obese but otherwise healthy participants were randomized to placebo or sibutramine (15 mg/day for 12 weeks). At baseline and posttreatment we measured the following: gastric emptying for solids and liquids by scintigraphy, gastric volumes by single-photon emission computed tomography, maximum tolerated volume and 30-minute postnutrient challenge symptoms, and selected gastrointestinal hormones. All participants received structured behavior therapy for weight management. The influence of candidate gene polymorphisms involved in norepinephrine and 5-hydroxytryptamine or receptor function (phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, guanine nucleotide binding protein beta polypeptide 3, alpha2A adrenoreceptor, and solute carrier family 6 [neurotransmitter transporter, serotonin] member 4 [homo sapiens] [SLC6A4]) on weight loss and gastric functions was evaluated. RESULTS: The overall average weight loss posttreatment was 5.4 +/- 0.8 (SEM) kg with sibutramine and 0.9 +/- 0.9 kg with placebo (P < .001). The sibutramine group showed significant retardation in gastric emptying of solids (P = .03), reduced maximum tolerated volume (P = .03), and increased postprandial peptide YY compared with the placebo group. Obese females showed greater effects of sibutramine on weight loss and gastric emptying of solids and liquids. Gastric volumes and postchallenge symptoms were not significantly different in the 2 treatment groups. The LS/SS genotype of the promoter for SLC6A4 was associated with enhanced weight loss with sibutramine. CONCLUSIONS: Weight reduction with sibutramine is associated with altered gastric functions and increased peptide YY and is significantly associated with SLC6A4 genotype. The role of genetic variation in SLC6A4 on weight loss in response to sibutramine deserves further study.
22815248	Protective Effects of a Purified Saponin Mixture from Astragalus corniculatus Bieb., in vivo Hepatotoxicity Models.	In this study, the in vivo effects of a purified saponin mixture (PSM), obtained from Astragalus corniculatus Bieb., were investigated using two in vivo hepatotoxicity models based on liver damage caused by paracetamol (PC) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4 ). The effects of PSM were compared with silymarin. Male Wistar rats were challenged orally with 20% CCl4 or PC (2 g/kg) four days after being pre-treated with PSM (100 mg/kg) or silymarin (200 mg/kg). A significant decrease of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities and glutathione (GSH) levels and an increase of malondialdehyde (MDA) quantity was observed after CCl4 and PC administration alone. PSM pre-treatment decreased serum transaminases and LDH activities and MDA levels and increased the levels of cell protector GSH. Biotransformation phase I enzymes were also assessed in both models. In the CCl4 hepatotoxicity model, pre-treatment with PSM or silymarin resulted in significantly increased activities of ethylmorphine-N-demethylase and aniline 4-hydroxylase activity and cytochrome P450, compared to the CCl4 only group. Neither silymarin nor PSM influenced PC biotransformation. Our results suggest that PSM, obtained from A. corniculatus, Bieb. showed in vivo hepatoprotective and antioxidant activities against CCl4 and PC-induced liver damage comparable to that of silymarin.

15060759	Binding of (-)-[3H]-CGP12177 at two sites in recombinant human beta 1-adrenoceptors and interaction with beta-blockers.	To verify the hypothesis that the non-conventional partial agonist (-)-CGP12177 binds at two beta(1)-adrenoceptor sites, human beta(1)-adrenoceptors, expressed in CHO cells, were labelled with (-)-[(3)H]-CGP12177. We compared the binding affinity and antagonist potency of 12 clinically used beta-blockers against the cyclic AMP-enhancing effects of (-)-isoprenaline and (-)-CGP12177.(-)-[(3)H]-CGP12177 bound to a high affinity site (H; K(H)=0.47 nM) and low affinity site (L); K(L)=235 nM). (-)-[(3)H]-CGP12177 dissociated from the beta(1)-adrenoceptors with a fast component (k(off)=0.45 min(-1)), consistent with the L-site, and a slow component (k(off)=0.017-0.033 min(-1)), consistent with the H-site. (-)-Isoprenaline and (-)-CGP12177 caused 96-fold and 12-fold maximal increases in cyclic AMP levels with -logEC(50)M of 8.2 and 7.6. (-)-CGP12177 antagonised the effects of (-)-isoprenaline with a pK(B) of 9.9. The beta-blockers antagonised the effects of (-)-isoprenaline more than the effects of (-)-CGP12177 with potency ratios: (-)-atenolol 1,000, (+/-)-metropolol 676, (-)-pindolol 631, (-)-timolol 589, (+/-)-carvedilol 204, (+/-)-oxprenolol 138, (+/-)-sotalol 132, (-)-propranolol 120, (+/-)-bisoprolol 95, (+/-)-alprenolol 81, (+/-)-nadolol 68 and (-)-bupranolol 56. In intact cells the binding constants of beta-blockers, estimated from competition with 3-5 nM (-)-[(3)H]-CGP12177 (binding to the H-site), correlated with the corresponding affinities estimated from antagonism of the (-)-isoprenaline effects. We conclude that (-)-[(3)H]-CGP12177 binds at two sites in the recombinant beta(1)-adrenoceptor. (-)-CGP12177 is an antagonist of catecholamine effects through the H-site and a non-conventional partial agonist through the L-site. beta-blockers are more potent antagonists through the H-site than the L-site.
16249494	The effects of prostaglandin analogues on IOP in prostanoid FP-receptor-deficient mice.	PURPOSE: This study was designed to clarify the involvement of the prostanoid FP receptor in the intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering effects of latanoprost, travoprost, bimatoprost, and unoprostone with the use of FP-receptor-deficient (FPKO) mice. METHODS: FPKO and wild-type (WT) mice were bred and acclimatized under a 12-hour light-dark cycle. IOP was measured under general anesthesia by a microneedle METHOD: To evaluate the effects of each drug, a single drop (3 muL) of each drug solution was topically applied in a masked manner to a randomly selected eye. IOP reduction was evaluated by the difference in IOP between the treated eye and the untreated contralateral eye in the same mouse. First, the diurnal variation and baseline IOP in WT and FPKO mice were measured. Then, to determine the window feasible for demonstrating the most marked ocular hypotensive effect, 0.005% latanoprost was applied to WT mice during the day or at night. The time when the ocular hypotensive effect was larger was selected for further studies to evaluate the effects of latanoprost (0.005%), travoprost (0.004%), bimatoprost (0.03%), and unoprostone (0.12%). In addition, bunazosin (0.1%) was also applied to demonstrate functional uveoscleral outflow in FPKO mice. All experiments were conducted under a masked study design. RESULTS: The baseline IOP (mean +/- SEM) in WT and FPKO mice was 15.0 +/- 0.2 and 15.0 +/- 0.3 mm Hg, respectively, during the day, and 18.9 +/- 0.4 and 19.2 +/- 0.4 mm Hg, respectively, at night. In WT mice, latanoprost significantly lowered IOP both during the day and at night, at 2 to 6 hours and 1 to 6 hours after application, respectively. Maximal IOP reduction was observed at 3 hours after drug instillation both during the day (10.9 +/- 1.8%) and at night (23.2 +/- 1.1%). At 3 hours after instillation, latanoprost (10.9 +/- 1.8% and 23.2 +/- 1.1%, daytime and nighttime, respectively), travoprost (15.9 +/- 1.4% and 26.1 +/- 1.2%) and bimatoprost (8.8 +/- 2.0 and 19.8 +/- 1.5%) significantly lowered IOP in WT mice both during the day and at night; isopropyl unoprostone significantly lowered IOP at night (13.7 +/- 1.9%) but not during the day (5.3 +/- 3.2%). In FPKO mice, latanoprost, travoprost, bimatoprost, and unoprostone showed no significant IOP-lowering effect. Bunazosin significantly lowered IOP in both WT (22.1 +/- 1.6%) and FPKO mice (22.2 +/- 2.1%). CONCLUSIONS: A single application of latanoprost, travoprost, bimatoprost, or unoprostone had no effect on IOP in FPKO mice with presumed functional uveoscleral outflow pathways. The prostanoid FP receptor plays a crucial role in the mechanism of early IOP lowering of all commercially available prostaglandin analogues.
10334992	Identification of a nuclear receptor for bile acids.	Bile acids are essential for the solubilization and transport of dietary lipids and are the major products of cholesterol catabolism. Results presented here show that bile acids are physiological ligands for the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), an orphan nuclear receptor. When bound to bile acids, FXR repressed transcription of the gene encoding cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis, and activated the gene encoding intestinal bile acid-binding protein, which is a candidate bile acid transporter. These results demonstrate a mechanism by which bile acids transcriptionally regulate their biosynthesis and enterohepatic transport.
1400062	Prolonged pulmonary hypertension caused by platelet-activating factor and leukotriene C4 in the rat lung.	Platelet-activating factor (PAF) and leukotrienes (LTs) are potent pulmonary hypertensive and inflammatory mediators produced by the lung. Previously we showed that a rapid injection of PAF into the pulmonary artery of an isolated rat lung produced an extended elevation in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP). The objective of the present study was to determine whether the extended pressor response induced by PAF was caused by prolonged activation of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway or slow clearance of LTs from the lung parenchyma. Rat lungs were perfused with a nonrecirculating physiological salt solution that contained indomethacin and albumin. Five minutes after a rapid injection of PAF into the pulmonary artery catheter, the following elevations (mean % above baseline) were observed: PAP (83%), LTB4 (3,260%), LTC4 (1,490%), LTD4 (970%), and LTE4 (1,500%). At 20 min these levels declined but were still significantly elevated above baseline. The 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor diethylcarbamazine (DEC), administered before the PAF injection, inhibited the elevations of PAP and all LTs. DEC administration that began 5 min after PAF reduced PAP and only LTC4 levels at 20 min in comparison to lungs with no DEC. The 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein inhibitor MK886, administered orally 2-6 h before perfusion, also inhibited the pressor response to PAF as well as LT production, as did DEC. We conclude that 1) the extended pulmonary hypertension induced by PAF was caused mainly by prolonged activation of 5-lipoxygenase with LTC4 production, 2) the relative overall lung clearance of LTB4, LTD4, and LTE4 was slower than that of LTC4, and 3) LTB4, LTD4, and LTE4 had no appreciable pressor effect.
23276150	Display of amino groups on substrate surfaces by simple dip-coating of methacrylate-based polymers and its application to DNA immobilization.	The implementation of a reactive functional group onto a material surface is of great importance. Reactive functional groups (e.g., an amino group and a hydroxyl group) are usually hydrophilic, which makes it difficult to display them on a dry polymer surface. We here propose a novel method for displaying amino groups on the surfaces of polymeric substrates through dip-coating of a methacrylate-based copolymer. We synthesized copolymers composed of methyl methacrylate and 2-aminoethyl methacrylate with different protecting groups or ion-complexes on their amino groups, then dip-coated the copolymers onto a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) substrate. Evaluation using a cleavable fluorescent compound, which was synthesized in the present study to quantify a small amount (pmol/cm(2)) of amino groups on a solid surface, revealed that the protection of amino groups affected their surface segregation in the copolymer coating. p-Toluenesulfonate ion-complex and tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) protection of amino groups were found to effectively display amino groups on the surface (more than 70 pmol/cm(2)). The density of amino groups displayed on a surface can be easily controlled by mixing the copolymer and PMMA before dip-coating. Dip-coating of the copolymer with Boc protection on various polymeric substrates also successfully displayed amino groups on their surfaces. Finally, we demonstrated that the amino groups displayed can be utilized for the immobilization of a DNA oligonucleotide on a substrate surface.
23257178	Steroid toxicity and detoxification in ascomycetous fungi.	In the last couple of decades fungal infections have become a significant clinical problem. A major interest into fungal steroid action has been provoked since research has proven that steroid hormones are toxic to fungi and affect the host/fungus relationship. Steroid hormones were found to differ in their antifungal activity in ascomycetous fungi Hortaea werneckii, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus oryzae. Dehydroepiandrosterone was shown to be the strongest inhibitor of growth in all three varieties of fungi followed by androstenedione and testosterone. For their protection, fungi use several mechanisms to lower the toxic effects of steroids. The efficiency of biotransformation in detoxification depended on the microorganism and steroid substrate used. Biotransformation was a relatively slow process as it also depended on the growth phase of the fungus. In addition to biotransformation, steroid extrusion out of the cells contributed to the lowering of the active intracellular steroid concentration. Plasma membrane Pdr5 transporter was found to be the most effective, followed by Snq2 transporter and vacuolar transporters Ybt1 and Ycf1. Proteins Aus1 and Dan1 were not found to be involved in steroid import. The research of possible targets of steroid hormone action in fungi suggests that steroid hormones inhibit ergosterol biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae and H. werneckii. Results of this inhibition caused changes in the sterol content of the cellular membrane. The presence of steroid hormones most probably causes the degradation of the Tat2 permease and impairment of tryptophan import.
23239534	Threshold collision-induced dissociation of hydrated magnesium: experimental and theoretical investigation of the binding energies for Mg(2+)(H2O)x complexes (x=2-10).	The sequential bond energies of Mg(2+)(H2O)x complexes, in which x=2-10, are measured by threshold collision-induced dissociation in a guided ion beam tandem mass spectrometer. From an electrospray ionization source that produces an initial distribution of Mg(2+)(H2O)x complexes in which x=7-10, complexes down to x=3 are formed by using an in-source fragmentation technique. Complexes smaller than Mg(2+)(H2O)3 cannot be formed in this source because charge separation into MgOH(+)(H2O) and H3O(+) is a lower-energy pathway than simple water loss from Mg(2+)(H2O)3. The kinetic energy dependent cross sections for dissociation of Mg(2+)(H2O)x complexes, in which x=3-10, are examined over a wide energy range to monitor all dissociation products and are modeled to obtain 0 and 298 K binding energies. Analysis of both primary and secondary water molecule losses from each sized complex provides thermochemistry for the sequential hydration energies of Mg(2+) for x=2-10 and the first experimental values for x=2-4. Additionally, the thermodynamic onsets leading to the charge-separation products from Mg(2+)(H2O)3 and Mg(2+)(H2O)4 are determined for the first time. Our experimental results for x=3-7 agree well with quantum chemical calculations performed here and previously calculated binding enthalpies, as well as previous measurements for x=6. The present values for x=7-10 are slightly lower than previous experimental results and theory, but within experimental uncertainties.
23552265	UVA photoirradiation of benzo[a]pyrene metabolites: induction of cytotoxicity, reactive oxygen species, and lipid peroxidation.	Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is a prototype for studying carcinogenesis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We have long been interested in studying the phototoxicity of PAHs. In this study, we determined that metabolism of BaP by human skin HaCaT keratinocytes resulted in six identified phase I metabolites, for example, BaP trans-7,8-dihydrodiol (BaP t-7,8-diol), BaP t-4,5-diol, BaP t-9,10-diol, 3-hydroxybenzo[a]pyrene (3-OH-BaP), BaP (7,10/8,9)tetrol, and BaP (7/8,9,10)tetrol. The photocytotoxicity of BaP, 3-OH-BaP, BaP t-7,8-diol, BaP trans-7,8-diol-anti-9,10-epoxide (BPDE), and BaP (7,10/8,9)tetrol in the HaCaT keratinocytes was examined. When irradiated with 1.0 J/cm(2) UVA light, these compounds when tested at doses of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 μM, all induced photocytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. When photoirradiation was conducted in the presence of a lipid (methyl linoleate), BaP metabolites, BPDE, and three related PAHs, pyrene, 7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-BaP trans-7,8-diol, and 7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-BaP trans-9,10-diol, all induced lipid peroxidation. The formation of lipid peroxides by BaP t-7,8-diol was inhibited by NaN3 and enhanced by deuterated methanol, which suggests that singlet oxygen may be involved in the generation of lipid peroxides. The formation of lipid hydroperoxides was partially inhibited by superoxide dismutase (SOD). Electron spin resonance spin trapping experiments indicated that both singlet oxygen and superoxide radical anion were generated from UVA photoirradiation of BPDE in a light dose responding manner.
20497523	Suppression of the inflammatory response in experimental arthritis is mediated via estrogen receptor alpha but not estrogen receptor beta.	INTRODUCTION: The immune modulatory role of estrogens in inflammation is complex. Both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects of estrogens have been described. Estrogens bind both estrogen receptor (ER)alpha and beta. The contribution of ERalpha and ERbeta to ER-mediated immune modulation was studied in delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) and in experimental arthritis METHODS: ER-mediated suppression of rat adjuvant arthritis (AA) was studied using ethinyl-estradiol (EE) and a selective ERbeta agonist (ERB-79). Arthritis was followed for 2 weeks. Next, effects of ER agonists (ethinyl-estradiol, an ERalpha selective agonist (ERA-63) and a selective ERbeta agonist (ERB-79) on the development of a tetanus toxoid (TT)-specific delayed type hypersensitivity response in wild type (WT) and in ERalpha- or ERbeta-deficient mice were investigated. Finally, EE and ERA-63 were tested for their immune modulating potential in established collagen induced arthritis in DBA/1J mice. Arthritis was followed for three weeks. Joint pathology was examined by histology and radiology. Local synovial cytokine production was analyzed using Luminex technology. Sera were assessed for COMP as a biomarker of cartilage destruction. RESULTS: EE was found to suppress clinical signs and symptoms in rat AA. The selective ERbeta agonist ERB-79 had no effect on arthritis symptoms in this model. In the TT-specific DTH model, EE and the selective ERalpha agonist ERA-63 suppressed the TT-specific swelling response in WT and ERbetaKO mice but not in ERalphaKO mice. As seen in the AA model, the selective ERbeta agonist ERB-79 did not suppress inflammation. Treatment with EE or ERA-63 suppressed clinical signs in collagen induced arthritis (CIA) in WT mice. This was associated with reduced inflammatory infiltrates and decreased levels of proinflammatory cytokines in CIA joints. CONCLUSIONS: ERalpha, but not ERbeta, is key in ER-mediated suppression of experimental arthritis. It remains to be investigated how these findings translate to human autoimmune disease.
17611273	Methylphenidate administration to juvenile rats alters brain areas involved in cognition, motivated behaviors, appetite, and stress.	Thousands of children receive methylphenidate (MPH; Ritalin) for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), yet the long-term neurochemical consequences of MPH treatment are unknown. To mimic clinical Ritalin treatment in children, male rats were injected with MPH (5 mg/kg) or vehicle twice daily from postnatal day 7 (PND7)-PND35. At the end of administration (PND35) or in adulthood (PND135), brain sections from littermate pairs were immunocytochemically labeled for neurotransmitters and cytological markers in 16 regions implicated in MPH effects and/or ADHD etiology. At PND35, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of rats given MPH showed 55% greater immunoreactivity (-ir) for the catecholamine marker tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), 60% more Nissl-stained cells, and 40% less norepinephrine transporter (NET)-ir density. In hippocampal dentate gyrus, MPH-receiving rats showed a 51% decrease in NET-ir density and a 61% expanded distribution of the new-cell marker PSA-NCAM (polysialylated form of neural cell adhesion molecule). In medial striatum, TH-ir decreased by 21%, and in hypothalamus neuropeptide Y-ir increased by 10% in MPH-exposed rats. At PND135, MPH-exposed rats exhibited decreased anxiety in the elevated plus-maze and a trend for decreased TH-ir in the mPFC. Neither PND35 nor PND135 rats showed major structural differences with MPH exposure. These findings suggest that developmental exposure to high therapeutic doses of MPH has short-term effects on select neurotransmitters in brain regions involved in motivated behaviors, cognition, appetite, and stress. Although the observed neuroanatomical changes largely resolve with time, chronic modulation of young brains with MPH may exert effects on brain neurochemistry that modify some behaviors even in adulthood.
16829128	More than cool: promiscuous relationships of menthol and other sensory compounds.	"Several temperature-activated transient receptor potential (thermoTRP) ion channels are the molecular receptors of natural compounds that evoke thermal and pain sensations. Menthol, popularly known for its cooling effect, activates TRPM8--a cold-activated thermoTRP ion channel. However, human physiological studies demonstrate a paradoxical role of menthol in modulation of warm sensation, and here, we show that menthol also activates heat-activated TRPV3. We further show that menthol inhibits TRPA1, potentially explaining the use of menthol as an analgesic. Similar to menthol, both camphor and cinnamaldehyde (initially reported to be specific activators of TRPV3 and TRPA1, respectively) also modulate other thermoTRPs. Therefore, we find that many ""sensory compounds"" presumed to be specific have a promiscuous relationship with thermoTRPs."
19428322	AMP-activated protein kinase-dependent and -independent mechanisms underlying in vitro antiglioma action of compound C.	We investigated the effect of compound C, a well-known inhibitor of the intracellular energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), on proliferation and viability of human U251 and rat C6 glioma cell lines. Compound C caused G(2)/M cell cycle block, accompanied by apoptotic glioma cell death characterized by caspase activation, phosphatidylserine exposure and DNA fragmentation. The mechanisms underlying the pro-apoptotic action of compound C involved induction of oxidative stress and downregulation of antiapoptotic molecule Bcl-2, while no alteration of pro-apoptotic Bax was observed. Compound C diminished AMPK phosphorylation and enzymatic activity, resulting in reduced phosphorylation of its target acetyl CoA carboxylase. AMPK activators metformin and AICAR partly prevented the cell cycle block, oxidative stress and apoptosis induced by compound C. The small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting of human AMPK mimicked compound C-induced G(2)/M cell cycle arrest, but failed to induce oxidative stress and apoptosis in U251 glioma cells. In conclusion, our data indicate that AMPK inhibition is required, but not sufficient for compound C-mediated apoptotic death of glioma cells.
23391631	The role of aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling pathway in cardiotoxicity of acute lead intoxication in vivo and in vitro rat model.	Lead (Pb(2+)) is a naturally occurring systemic toxicant heavy metal that affects several organs in the body including the kidneys, liver, and central nervous system. However, Pb(2+)-induced cardiotoxicity has never been investigated yet and the exact mechanism of Pb(2+) associated cardiotoxicity has not been studied. The current study was designed to investigate the potential effect of Pb(2+) to induce cardiotoxicity in vivo and in vitro rat model and to explore the molecular mechanisms and the role of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and regulated gene, cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1), in Pb(2+)-mediated cardiotoxicity. For these purposes, Wistar albino rats were treated with Pb(2+) (25, 50 and 100mg/kg, i.p.) for three days and the effects on physiological and histopathological parameters of cardiotoxicity were determined. At the in vitro level, rat cardiomyocyte H9c2 cell lines were incubated with increasing concentration of Pb(2+) (25, 50, and 100μM) and the expression of hypertrophic genes, α- and β-myosin heavy chain (α-MHC and β-MHC), brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP), and CYP1A1 were determined at the mRNA and protein levels using real-time PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. The results showed that Pb(2+) significantly induced cardiotoxicity and heart failure as evidenced by increase cardiac enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase and changes in histopathology in vivo. In addition, Pb(2+) treatment induced β-MHC and BNP whereas inhibited α-MHC mRNA and protein levels in vivo in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, at the in vitro level, Pb(2+) treatment induced both β-MHC and α-MHC mRNA levels in time- and dose-dependent manner. Importantly, these changes were accompanied with a proportional increase in the expression of CYP1A1 mRNA and protein expression levels, suggesting a role for the CYP1A1 in cardiotoxicity. The direct evidence for the involvement of CYP1A1 in the induction of cardiotoxicity by Pb(2+) was evidenced by the ability of AhR antagonist, resveratrol, to significantly inhibit the Pb(2+)-modulated effect on β-MHC and α-MHC mRNAs. It was concluded that acute lead exposure induced cardiotoxicity through AhR/CYP1A1-mediated mechanism.
23142547	A non-catalytic function of Rev1 in translesion DNA synthesis and mutagenesis is mediated by its stable interaction with Rad5.	DNA damage tolerance consisting of template switching and translesion synthesis is a major cellular mechanism in response to unrepaired DNA lesions during replication. The Rev1 pathway constitutes the major mechanism of translesion synthesis and base damage-induced mutagenesis in model cell systems. Rev1 is a dCMP transferase, but additionally plays non-catalytic functions in translesion synthesis. Using the yeast model system, we attempted to gain further insights into the non-catalytic functions of Rev1. Rev1 stably interacts with Rad5 (a central component of the template switching pathway) via the C-terminal region of Rev1 and the N-terminal region of Rad5. Supporting functional significance of this interaction, both the Rev1 pathway and Rad5 are required for translesion synthesis and mutagenesis of 1,N(6)-ethenoadenine. Furthermore, disrupting the Rev1-Rad5 interaction by mutating Rev1 did not affect its dCMP transferase, but led to inactivation of the Rev1 non-catalytic function in translesion synthesis of UV-induced DNA damage. Deletion analysis revealed that the C-terminal 21-amino acid sequence of Rev1 is uniquely required for its interaction with Rad5 and is essential for its non-catalytic function. Deletion analysis additionally implicated a C-terminal region of Rev1 in its negative regulation. These results show that a non-catalytic function of Rev1 in translesion synthesis and mutagenesis is mediated by its interaction with Rad5.
17704420	FCGR2A and FCGR3A polymorphisms associated with clinical outcome of epidermal growth factor receptor expressing metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with single-agent cetuximab.	PURPOSE: Cetuximab, a chimeric immunoglobulin G 1 (IgG1) anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody (mAb), has shown efficacy in 10% of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). Recent studies demonstrate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) is one of the modes of action for rituximab and trastuzumab. Fragment c (Fc) portion of IgG1 mAb has shown to induce ADCC. Fragment c gamma receptors (FcgammaR) play an important role in initiating ADCC. Studies have shown that two IgG FcgammaR polymorphisms (FCGR2A-H131R and FCGR3A-V158F) independently predict response to rituximab in patients with follicular lymphoma. We tested the hypothesis of whether these two polymorphisms are associated with clinical outcome in metastatic CRC patients treated with single-agent cetuximab. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine metastatic CRC patients were enrolled onto the ImClone0144 trial. Using an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based method, gene polymorphisms of FCGA2A-H131R and FCGA3A-V158F were assessed from genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood samples. RESULTS: FCGR2A-H131R and FCGR3A-V158F polymorphisms were independently associated with progression-free survival (PFS; P = .037 and .055, respectively; log-rank test). Combined analysis of these two polymorphisms showed that patients with the favorable genotypes (FCGR2A, any histidine allele, and FCGR3A, any phenylalanine allele) showed a median PFS of 3.7 months (95% CI, 2.4 to 4.4 months), whereas patients with any two unfavorable genotypes (FCGR2A arginine/arginine or valine/valine) had a PFS of 1.1 months (95% CI, 1.0 to 1.4 months; P = .004; log-rank test). CONCLUSION: Our preliminary data suggest that these two polymorphisms may be useful molecular markers to predict clinical outcome in metastatic CRC patients treated with cetuximab and that they may indicate a role of ADCC of cetuximab.
21926191	Cabozantinib (XL184), a novel MET and VEGFR2 inhibitor, simultaneously suppresses metastasis, angiogenesis, and tumor growth.	The signaling pathway of the receptor tyrosine kinase MET and its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is important for cell growth, survival, and motility and is functionally linked to the signaling pathway of VEGF, which is widely recognized as a key effector in angiogenesis and cancer progression. Dysregulation of the MET/VEGF axis is found in a number of human malignancies and has been associated with tumorigenesis. Cabozantinib (XL184) is a small-molecule kinase inhibitor with potent activity toward MET and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2), as well as a number of other receptor tyrosine kinases that have also been implicated in tumor pathobiology, including RET, KIT, AXL, and FLT3. Treatment with cabozantinib inhibited MET and VEGFR2 phosphorylation in vitro and in tumor models in vivo and led to significant reductions in cell invasion in vitro. In mouse models, cabozantinib dramatically altered tumor pathology, resulting in decreased tumor and endothelial cell proliferation coupled with increased apoptosis and dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth in breast, lung, and glioma tumor models. Importantly, treatment with cabozantinib did not increase lung tumor burden in an experimental model of metastasis, which has been observed with inhibitors of VEGF signaling that do not target MET. Collectively, these data suggest that cabozantinib is a promising agent for inhibiting tumor angiogenesis and metastasis in cancers with dysregulated MET and VEGFR signaling.
2922761	Retinoid-induced hemorrhaging and bone toxicity in rats fed diets deficient in vitamin K.	The recent increase in the clinical use of synthetic vitamin A compounds has led to concern of possible side effects. Some of these effects are known to be influenced by dietary levels of vitamin K. We therefore compared the toxic effects of 13-cis-retinoic acid (13cisRA), retinyl acetate (ROAc), and N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (4HPR) in male Sprague-Dawley rats maintained on diets containing different levels of vitamin K. Animals were fed either an NIH-07 diet supplemented with menadione (3.1 ppm vitamin K3), an NIH-07 diet not supplemented with menadione, or an AIN-076 purified diet devoid of vitamin K. The retinoids had no effect on prothrombin times of animals fed the supplemented diet. When menadione was omitted from the diet, however, 4HPR-dosed animals had elevated prothrombin times. This effect was observed as early as Day 7 and was accompanied by one confirmed hemorrhagic death. 13cisRA-dosed animals showed no change in prothrombin times. In the high-dose ROAc group, there was a twofold increase in prothrombin times but only after prolonged dosing. In animals fed the NIH-07 diets, 13cisRA and ROAc induced multiple bone fractures at all dose levels. In contrast, 4HPR administered at the highest dose induced only one fracture in one animal. Animals fed the purified diet lost weight faster and diet sooner than those maintained on the other diets. Bone fractures were not observed in these animals because of early deaths resulting from hemorrhaging. For all retinoid-dosed groups maintained on the purified diet, changes in prothrombin times occured as early as 1 week. The order of effect was 4HPR greater than ROAc greater than 13cisRA, with increases in prothrombin times correlating with increases in hemorrhagic deaths. Hence, the degree of retinoid-induced hemorrhage, but not the incidence of bone fractures, was inversely related to vitamin K levels in the diet. 13cisRA and ROAc, but not 4HPR, caused a dose-dependent reduction in plasma osteocalcin, an effect that correlated with retinoid-induced bone effects. In contrast, serum alkaline phosphatase was elevated in animals dosed with 13cisRA or 4HPR but not in those dose with ROAc. For this enzyme, the electrophoretic pattern on agarose gel showed a decrease, compared to controls, in the major isozyme in serum of ROAc-dosed animals. Hence, plasma osteocalcin is a better predictor of retinoid-induced bone effects than serum alkaline phosphatase.
23087261	Lysine 48-linked polyubiquitination of organic anion transporter-1 is essential for its protein kinase C-regulated endocytosis.	Organic anion transporter-1 (OAT1) mediates the body's disposition of a diverse array of environmental toxins and clinically important drugs. Therefore, understanding the regulation of this transporter has profound clinical significance. We had previously established that OAT1 undergoes constitutive internalization from and recycling back to the cell surface and that acute activation of protein kinase C (PKC) inhibits OAT1 activity by reducing OAT1 cell-surface expression through accelerating its internalization from cell surface to intracellular compartments. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In the current study, we provide novel evidence that acute activation of PKC significantly enhances OAT1 ubiquitination both in vitro and ex vivo. We further show that ubiquitination of cell-surface OAT1 increases in cells transfected with dominant negative mutant of dynamin-2, a maneuver blocking OAT1 internalization, which suggests that OAT1 ubiquitination proceeds before OAT1 internalization. Mass spectroscopy has revealed that ubiquitination of OAT1 consists of polyubiquitin chains, primarily through lysine 48 linkage. Transfection of cells with the dominant negative mutant of ubiquitin Ub-K48R, which prevents the formation of Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains, abolishes PKC-stimulated OAT1 ubiquitination and internalization. Together, our findings demonstrate for the first time that Lys48-linked polyubiquitination is essential for PKC-regulated OAT1 trafficking.
18408530	Clinical evidence for serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition of duloxetine.	Most antidepressants in clinical use are believed to function by enhancing neurotransmission of serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] and/or norepinephrine (NE) via inhibition of neurotransmitter reuptake. Agents that affect reuptake of both 5-HT and NE (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) have been postulated to offer greater efficacy for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). These dual-acting agents also display a broader spectrum of action, including efficacy for MDD and associated painful physical symptoms, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, generalized anxiety disorder, and fibromyalgia syndrome. Substantial preclinical evidence shows that duloxetine, an approved drug for the treatment of MDD, generalized anxiety disorder, and the management of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, inhibits reuptake of both 5-HT and NE. This paper reviews clinical and neurochemical evidence of duloxetine's effects on 5-HT and NE reuptake inhibition. The clinical evidence supporting duloxetine's effects on NE reuptake inhibition includes indirect measures such as altered excretion of NE metabolites, cardiovascular effects, and treatment-emergent adverse event profiles similar to those for other drugs believed to act through the inhibition of NE reuptake. In summary, the data presented in this report provide clinical evidence of a mechanism for duloxetine involving both 5-HT and NE reuptake inhibition in humans and are consistent with preclinical evidence for 5-HT/NE reuptake inhibition.
22585533	β-Eudesmol induces JNK-dependent apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway in HL60 cells.	β-eudesmol, a natural sesquiterpenol present in a variety of Chinese herbs, is known to inhibit the proliferation of human tumor cells. However, the molecular mechanisms of the effect of β-eudesmol on human tumor cells are unknown. In the present study, we report the cytotoxic effect of β-eudesmol on the human leukemia HL60 cells and its molecular mechanisms. The cytotoxic effect of β-eudesmol on HL60 cells was associated with apoptosis, which was characterized by the presence of DNA fragmentation. β-eudesmol-induced apoptosis was accompanied by cleavage of caspase-3, caspase-9, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase; downregulation of Bcl-2 expression; release of cytochrome c from mitochondria; and decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinases was observed in β-eudesmol-treated HL60 cells, and the inhibitor of JNK blocked the β-eudesmol-induced apoptosis, downregulation of Bcl-2, and the loss of MMP. These data suggest that β-eudesmol induces apoptosis in HL60 cells via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, which is controlled through JNK signaling. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
23613149	Dietary Flaxseed Oil Supplementation Mitigates the Effect of Lead on the Enzymes of Carbohydrate Metabolism, Brush Border Membrane, and Oxidative Stress in Rat Kidney Tissues.	Lead is a heavy metal widely distributed in the environment. Lead is a ubiquitous environmental toxin that is capable of causing numerous acute and chronic illnesses. Human and animal exposure demonstrates that lead is nephrotoxic. However, attempts to reduce lead-induced nephrotoxicity were not found suitable for clinical use. Recently, flaxseed oil (FXO), a rich source of ω-3 fatty acids and lignans, has been shown to prevent/reduce the progression of certain types of cardiovascular and renal disorders. In view of this, the present study investigates the protective effect of FXO on lead acetate (PbAc)-induced renal damage. Rats were pre-fed normal diet and the diet rich in FXO for 14 days, and then, four doses of lead acetate (25 mg/kg body weight) were administered intraperitoneally while still on diet. Various serum parameters, enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism, brush border membrane (BBM), and oxidative stress were analyzed in rat kidney. PbAc nephrotoxicity was characterized by increased serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen. PbAc increased the activities of lactate dehydrogenase and NADP-malic enzyme, whereas it decreased malate and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase, and BBM enzyme activities. PbAc caused oxidant/antioxidant imbalances as reflected by increased lipid peroxidation and decreased activities of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase. In contrast, FXO alone enhanced the enzyme activities of carbohydrate metabolism, BBM, and antioxidant defense system. FXO feeding to PbAc-treated rats markedly enhanced resistance to PbAc-elicited deleterious effects. In conclusion, dietary FXO supplementation ameliorated PbAc-induced specific metabolic alterations and oxidative damage by empowering antioxidant defense mechanism and improving BBM integrity and energy metabolism.
23454149	Inhibition of angiogenesis and invasion by DMBT is mediated by downregulation of VEGF and MMP-9 through Akt pathway in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.	Invasion, either directly or via metastasis formation, is the main cause of death in cancer patients, development of efficient anti-invasive agents is an important research challenge. In order to obtain more potent inhibitors, a series of brartemicin analogs were synthesized and evaluated for their inhibitory activity against invasion. Among the synthetic analogs tested, DMBT, 6,6'-bis (2,3-dimethoxybenzoyl)-a,a-d-trehalose, was found to be the most potent anti-invasive agent. But the effects of DMBT on breast cancer cells were not known. In this study, the effects of DMBT on invasion and metastasis in MDA-MB-231 cells were investigated. MTT assay showed that no obvious inhibitory or cytotoxic effect of DMBT was found. DMBT could inhibit invasion, migration and tube formation of HUVECs. Gelatin zymography showed that DMBT inhibited secretion and activity of MMP-9. Western blotting demonstrated that DMBT effectively suppressed the expression of VEGF, p-VEGFR-2, p-EGFR, and p-Akt. These results suggested that DMBT could inhibit invasion and angiogenesis by downregulation of VEGFand MMP-9, resulting from the inhibition of Akt pathway. DMBT might be a promising lead molecule for the anti-metastasis and serve as a therapeutic agent to inhibit breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis.
11067741	Stable expression of varied levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase in primary cultures of endothelial cells.	Nitric oxide (NO*), generated by nitric oxide synthase (NOS II) from immunostimulated cells during infection, plays an important role in host immune defense against microbial invasion. The impact of different rates of NO* production on host cell function has not been defined. Herein, we describe the development of a method to express varied levels of murine NOS II in bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells. A retroviral vector (pMFGSNOS) encoding NOS II was used to transduce primary cultures of endothelial cells. Bovine endothelial cells were susceptible to this transduction and up to 18% of the cells expressed immunodetectable murine NOS II. The NOS II-transduced endothelial cells were cultured on the three-dimensional matrix, Gelfoam, for 8-10 days. Stable expression of NOS II was assessed by measuring nitrite accumulation in media every 2 days. By day 10, endothelial cells on Gelfoam were found to secrete NO* at a rate exceeding 1.0 microM/h/10(6) cells, concomitant with an enhanced level of NOS II activity. Argininosuccinate synthetase, a key enzyme in the metabolism of l-citrulline to l-arginine, increased as well, perhaps in response to dimunition of the intracellular arginine pool corresponding to the observed high output of NO*. In spite of the continuous flux of NO*, endothelial cell viability was not effected. This system provides the opportunity to assess the impact of different levels of sustained NO* production on endothelial cell physiology.
23228182	Amino acid-based zwitterionic poly(serine methacrylate) as an antifouling material.	A serine-based zwitterionic poly(serine methacrylate) (pSerMA) was developed in this work to be used as a potential antifouling material. A surface-initiated photoiniferter-mediated polymerization (SI-PIMP) method was used to graft polymer brushes on gold surfaces. The pSerMA-grafted samples with different polymer film thicknesses were readily prepared by varying the UV-irradiation time. With the optimal film thickness, the adsorptions from bovine serum albumin, human serum, and human plasma onto the pSerMA-grafted surfaces, as evaluated by a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor, were 1.8, 9.2, and 12.9 ng/cm(2), respectively, comparable to the traditional antifouling material such as poly(ethylene glycol). The pSerMA-grafted surfaces also strongly resisted adhesion from bovine aortic endothelial cells. This is the first work to develop an amino acid-based zwitterionic polymer as an antifouling material, demonstrating that pSerMA is a promising alternative to the traditional ethylene glycol-based antifouling materials.
22722028	Deep brain stimulation, histone deacetylase inhibitors and glutamatergic drugs rescue resistance to fear extinction in a genetic mouse model.	Anxiety disorders are characterized by persistent, excessive fear. Therapeutic interventions that reverse deficits in fear extinction represent a tractable approach to treating these disorders. We previously reported that 129S1/SvImJ (S1) mice show no extinction learning following normal fear conditioning. We now demonstrate that weak fear conditioning does permit fear reduction during massed extinction training in S1 mice, but reveals specific deficiency in extinction memory consolidation/retrieval. Rescue of this impaired extinction consolidation/retrieval was achieved with d-cycloserine (N-methly-d-aspartate partial agonist) or MS-275 (histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor), applied after extinction training. We next examined the ability of different drugs and non-pharmacological manipulations to rescue the extreme fear extinction deficit in S1 following normal fear conditioning with the ultimate aim to produce low fear levels in extinction retrieval tests. Results showed that deep brain stimulation (DBS) by applying high frequency stimulation to the nucleus accumbens (ventral striatum) during extinction training, indeed significantly reduced fear during extinction retrieval compared to sham stimulation controls. Rescue of both impaired extinction acquisition and deficient extinction consolidation/retrieval was achieved with prior extinction training administration of valproic acid (a GABAergic enhancer and HDAC inhibitor) or AMN082 [metabotropic glutamate receptor 7 (mGlu7) agonist], while MS-275 or PEPA (AMPA receptor potentiator) failed to affect extinction acquisition in S1 mice. Collectively, these data identify potential beneficial effects of DBS and various drug treatments, including those with HDAC inhibiting or mGlu7 agonism properties, as adjuncts to overcome treatment resistance in exposure-based therapies. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Cognitive Enhancers'.
23183374	A combined nuclear and nucleolar localization motif in activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) controls immunoglobulin class switching.	Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is a DNA mutator enzyme essential for adaptive immunity. AID initiates somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination (CSR) by deaminating cytosine to uracil in specific immunoglobulin (Ig) gene regions. However, other loci, including cancer-related genes, are also targeted. Thus, tight regulation of AID is crucial to balance immunity versus disease such as cancer. AID is regulated by several mechanisms including nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Here we have studied nuclear import kinetics and subnuclear trafficking of AID in live cells and characterized in detail its nuclear localization signal. Importantly, we find that the nuclear localization signal motif also directs AID to nucleoli where it colocalizes with its interaction partner, catenin-β-like 1 (CTNNBL1), and physically associates with nucleolin and nucleophosmin. Moreover, we demonstrate that release of AID from nucleoli is dependent on its C-terminal motif. Finally, we find that CSR efficiency correlates strongly with the arithmetic product of AID nuclear import rate and DNA deamination activity. Our findings suggest that directional nucleolar transit is important for the physiological function of AID and demonstrate that nuclear/nucleolar import and DNA cytosine deamination together define the biological activity of AID. This is the first study on subnuclear trafficking of AID and demonstrates a new level in its complex regulation. In addition, our results resolve the problem related to dissociation of deamination activity and CSR activity of AID mutants.
22982445	Leukotriene D4 induces cognitive impairment through enhancement of CysLT₁ R-mediated amyloid-β generation in mice.	Amyloid plaques in the extracellular parenchyma mainly consist of amyloid-β peptides (Aβ), one of the pathological hallmarks in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, we examined neuroinflammation, amyloidogenesis, and memory performance following intracerebral infusions of leukotriene D4 (LTD4) in mice. The results demonstrated that intracerebral infusions of LTD4 (1 ng/mouse) produced memory impairment as determined by Morris water maze test and Y-maze test in mice, and caused the accumulation of Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 in the hippocampus and cortex through increased activity of β- and γ-secretases accompanied with increased expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP). LTD4 also induced expression of cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLT(1)R) and NF-κB p65 in the hippocampus and cortex. Pretreatment with pranlukast (1.5 ng/mouse, intracerebroventricularly), a CysLT(1)R antagonist, blocked LTD4-induced amyloidogenesis, memory deficits. Pranlukast (0.6 μM) also prevented LTD4 (20 nM)-induced amyloidogenesis in the cultured neurons in vitro. Moreover, LTD4-induced increases in CysLT(1)R and NF-κB p65 in the brain were also attenuated by pranlukast. These results suggest that LTD4 increases Aβ peptide burden via activation of CysLT(1)R, which further affects APP levels and activity of β- and γ-secretases via the NF-κB pathway. Our findings identify CysLT(1)R signaling as a novel proinflammatory and proamyloidogenic pathway, and suggest a rationale for development of therapeutics targeting the CysLT(1)R in neuroinflammatory diseases such as AD.
11340119	Stability of vitamin B-6-dependent aminotransferase activity in frozen packed erythrocytes is dependent on storage temperature.	Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) stimulation of erythrocyte alanine and aspartate aminotransferase (EALT, EAST) activities is a frequently used functional measure of vitamin B-6 status. Stability of enzyme activities and activity coefficients (AC, stimulated / unstimulated) was assessed in packed erythrocytes frozen at -20, -80 degrees C and under liquid nitrogen (-196 degrees C). Activities of EALT and EAST, with and without added PLP, were determined in fresh erythrocytes (d 0) and frozen samples on d 1, 7, 14, 28, 58 and 84. In -20 degrees C samples, EALT basal activity decreased 17 and 22% (P < or = 0.05 for both) by d 58 and 84, respectively, and EAST basal activity decreased 40% (P < or = 0.05) by d 58. In -80 and -196 degrees C samples, EALT and EAST basal activities did not change significantly. Activity coefficients did not differ significantly from d 0 at any storage temperature, but EAST-AC increased 9-19% (nonsignificant) in samples stored at -20 and -80 degrees C for 7 to 84 d. Additionally, EAST-AC was significantly higher in -20 than -80 and -196 degrees C samples on d 1 and 58, respectively. Erythrocytes may be frozen for 28 d at -20 degrees C and 84 d at -80 degrees C before analysis for EALT; for EAST, activity should be measured on fresh erythrocytes.
15199474	P2Y12, a new platelet ADP receptor, target of clopidogrel.	"Clopidogrel is a potent antithrombotic drug that inhibits ADP-induced platelet aggregation. The results of large clinical trials have demonstrated an overall benefit of clopidogrel over aspirin in the prevention of vascular ischemic events (myocardial infarction, stroke, vascular death) in patients with a history of symptomatic atherosclerotic disease. The antiaggregating effect of clopidogrel is attributed to an irreversible inhibition of ADP binding to a purinergic receptor present at the platelet surface. Clopidogrel is not active in vitro and can be considered a precursor of an active metabolite formed in the liver. The chemical structure of this active metabolite and its biological activity have been described recently. Several purinergic receptors have been described on platelets; P2X (1), a calcium channel, and P2Y1 a Gq-coupled seven-transmembrane domain receptor, have been found not to be antagonized by clopidogrel. Another Gi (2)-coupled receptor (named P2Y12) has been recently cloned and stably expressed in CHO cells. These cells displayed a strong affinity for (33)P-2MeS-ADP, a stable analogue of ADP, the binding characteristics of which corresponded in all points to those observed on platelets. The binding of (33)P-2MeS-ADP to these cells was strongly inhibited by the active metabolite of clopidogrel with a potency that was consistent with that observed for this compound on platelets. In these transfected CHO cells, as in platelets, ADP and 2MeS-ADP induced adenylyl cyclase downregulation, an effect that was inhibited by the active metabolite of clopidogrel. These results demonstrate that this receptor corresponds to the previously called ""P2t"" platelet receptor and show that the active metabolite of clopidogrel binds in a covalent manner to this receptor, thus explaining how it blocks the aggregating effect of ADP on platelets."
16395286	Dose-response effect of tetracyclines on cerebral matrix metalloproteinase-9 after vascular endothelial growth factor hyperstimulation.	Brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVMs) are a potentially life-threatening disorder. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 activity was greatly increased in BAVM tissue specimens. Doxycycline was shown to decrease cerebral MMP-9 activities and angiogenesis induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In the present study, we determined the dose-response effects of doxycycline and minocycline on cerebral MMP-9 using our mouse model with VEGF focal hyperstimulation delivered with adenoviral vector (AdVEGF) in the brain. Mice were treated with doxycycline or minocycline, respectively, at 1, 5, 10, 30, 50, or 100 mg/kg/day through drinking water for 1 week. Our results have shown that MMP-9 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression was inhibited by doxycycline starting at 10 mg/kg/day (P<0.02). Minocycline showed more potent inhibition on MMP-9 mRNA expression, starting at 1 (P<0.005) and further at more than 30 (P<0.001) mg/kg/day. At the enzymatic activity level, doxycycline started to suppress MMP-9 activity at 5 mg/kg/day (P<0.001), while minocycline had an effect at a lower dose, 1 mg/kg/day (P<0.02). The inhibition of cerebral MMP-9 mRNA and activity were highly correlated with drug levels in the brain tissue. We also assessed the potential relevant signaling pathway in vitro to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the MMP-9 inhibition by tetracyclines. In vitro, minocycline, but not doxycycline, inhibits MMP-9, at least in part, via the extracellular signaling-related kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)-mediated pathway. This study provided the evidence that the tetracyclines inhibit stimulated cerebral MMP-9 at multiple levels and are effective at very low doses, offering great potential for therapeutic use.
8484964	Purification of nonantibiotic insulinase inhibitors from bacitracin.	Bacitracin is commonly used in metabolic studies as an insulinase inhibitor. The many isoforms of the commercial preparation were fractionated by charge and size in order to find the most active rat-muscle insulinase inhibitors. CM-Sepharose chromatography revealed that most of the inhibitory activity was contained in a fraction (CM-Inh) that amounted to less than 5% of the mixture. The CM-Inh fraction could be further separated by size on Bio-Gel P4 columns. Six subgroups, each with characteristic specific activity, were isolated. The most potent inhibitor fractions have no antibiotic activity and have molecular weights about twice that of bacitracin A. The peaks isolated by means of Bio-Gel P4 chromatography can be further fractionated by reversed phase HPLC on a C8 column, and by electrophoresis on nonreducing acrylamide gels.
19549602	Amitriptyline is a TrkA and TrkB receptor agonist that promotes TrkA/TrkB heterodimerization and has potent neurotrophic activity.	Neurotrophins, the cognate ligands for the Trk receptors, are homodimers and induce Trk dimerization through a symmetric bivalent mechanism. We report here that amitriptyline, an antidepressant drug, directly binds TrkA and TrkB and triggers their dimerization and activation. Amitriptyline, but not any other tricyclic or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants, promotes TrkA autophosphorylation in primary neurons and induces neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. Amitriptyline binds the extracellular domain of both TrkA and TrkB and promotes TrkA-TrkB receptor heterodimerization. Truncation of amitriptyline binding motif on TrkA abrogates the receptor dimerization by amitriptyline. Administration of amitriptyline to mice activates both receptors and significantly reduces kainic acid-triggered neuronal cell death. Inhibition of TrkA, but not TrkB, abolishes amitriptyline's neuroprotective effect without impairing its antidepressant activity. Thus, amitriptyline acts as a TrkA and TrkB agonist and possesses marked neurotrophic activity.
12517247	Eprosartan for the treatment of hypertension.	Antihypertensive agents are proven to reduce the cardiovascular risk of stroke, coronary heart disease and cardiac failure. The ideal antihypertensive agent should control all grades of hypertension and have a placebo-like side effect profile. Angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonists are a relatively new class of antihypertensive agent that block AII Type 1 (AT(1)) receptors, and reduce the pressor effects of AII in the vasculature. By this mechanism, they induce similar pharmacological effects compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, resulting in a lowering of blood pressure. However, AII receptor blockers differ from ACE inhibitors with respect to side effects, and induce less cough, a side effect which may be related to bradykinin or other mediators such as substance P. Within the class of AII blockers, eprosartan differs from other currently available agents in terms of chemical structure, as it is a non-biphenyl, non-tetrazole, non-peptide antagonist with a dual pharmacological mode of action. Eprosartan acts at vascular AT(1) receptors (postsynaptically) and at presynaptic AT(1) receptors, where it inhibits sympathetically stimulated noradrenaline release. Its lack of metabolism by cytochrome P450 enzymes confers a low potential for metabolic drug interactions and may be of importance when treating elderly patients and those on multiple drugs. In clinical trials, eprosartan has been demonstrated to be at least as effective in reducing blood pressure as the ACE inhibitor enalapril, and has significantly lower side effects. Eprosartan is safe, effective and well-tolerated in long-term treatment, either as a monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs such as hydrochlorothiazide.
23578968	Evaluation of a predictive in vitro Leydig cell assay for anti-androgenicity of phthalate esters in the rat.	An in vitro assay using the rat Leydig cell line R2C was evaluated for its ability to quantitatively predict inhibition of testosterone synthesis. Results obtained for endocrine active phthalates (MEHP, MBP), and inactive phthalates (MMP and MEP) were highly consistent with in vivo results based on tissue and media concentrations. Statistically significant inhibition of testosterone synthesis (p<0.05, 1-way ANOVA) was observed at 1μM MBP and 3μM MEHP, while MEP and MMP did not affect inhibition of testosterone synthesis until much higher concentrations (≫100μM). Concentrations causing 50% inhibition of testosterone synthesis for MBP and MEHP (3 and 6μM respectively), were similar to in vivo values (3 and 7μM). The R2C assay was used to determine the relative potency of 14 structurally diverse monoesters and oxidative metabolites of MEHP. Monoesters with alkyl chains 4-5 carbons in length had the highest potency for testosterone inhibition, while 0-2 carbon alkyl chains were least potent. Phase I metabolism did not completely inactivate MEHP, underscoring the need for metabolism data when interpreting in vitro pharmacodynamic data. This steroid inhibition assay provides a predictive in vitro alternative to expensive and timeconsuming developmental rat studies for phthalate-induced antiandrogenicity.
15546741	9-cis-retinoic acid analogues with bulky hydrophobic rings: new RXR-selective agonists.	Stille cross-coupling of aryltriflates 10 and dienylstannane 11, oxidation and Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction afforded stereoselectively retinoates 15. Saponification provided the carboxylic acids 8a and 8b, retinoids that incorporate a bulky hydrophobic ring while preserving the 9-cis-geometry of the parent system. In contrast to the pan-RAR/RXR agonistic profile of the lower homologue of 8a, compound 7 (LG100567), retinoids 8 showed selective binding and transactivation of RXR, devoid of significant RAR activation. In PLB985 leukemia cells that require RXR agonists for differentiation compounds 8 induced maturation in the presence of the RAR-selective pan-agonist TTNPB; this effect was blocked by an RXR-selective antagonist.
18773878	DNA damage and homologous recombination signaling induced by thymidylate deprivation.	DNA damage is accepted as a consequence of thymidylate deprivation induced by chemotherapeutic inhibitors of thymidylate synthase (TS), but the types of damage and signaling responses remain incompletely understood. Thymidylate deprivation increases dUTP and uracil in DNA, which is removed by base excision repair (BER). Because BER requires a synthesis step, strand break intermediates presumably accumulate. Thymidylate deprivation also induces cell cycle arrest during replication. Homologous recombination (HR) is a means of repairing persistent BER intermediates and collapsed replication forks. There are also intimate links between HR and S-phase checkpoint pathways. In this study, the goals were to determine the involvement of HR-associated proteins and DNA damage signaling responses to thymidylate deprivation. When RAD51, which is a central component of HR, was depleted by siRNA cells were sensitized to raltitrexed (RTX), which specifically inhibits TS. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration in mammalian cells that depletion of RAD51 causes sensitivity to thymidylate deprivation. Activation of DNA damage signaling responses was examined following treatment with RTX. Phosphorylation of replication protein A (RPA2 subunit) and formation of damage-induced foci were strikingly evident following IC(50) doses of RTX. Induction was much more striking following RTX treatment than with hydroxyurea, which is commonly used to inhibit replication. RTX treatment also induced foci of RAD51, gamma-H2AX, phospho-Chk1, and phospho-NBS1, although the extent of co-localization with RPA2 foci varied. Collectively, the results suggest that HR and S-phase checkpoint signaling processes are invoked by thymidylate deprivation and influence cellular resistance to thymidylate deprivation.
23489521	The use of insulin analogues in pregnancy.	Excellent glycaemic control is essential in pregnancy to optimise maternal and foetal outcomes. The aim of this review is to assess the efficacy and safety of insulin analogues in pregnancy. Insulin lispro and insulin aspart are safe in pregnancy and may improve post-prandial glycaemic control in women with type 1 diabetes. However, a lack of data indicating improved foetal outcomes would suggest that there is no imperative to switch to a short-acting analogue where the woman's diabetes is well controlled with human insulin. There are no reports of the use of insulin glulisine in pregnancy and so its use cannot be recommended. Most studies of insulin glargine in pregnancy are small, retrospective and include women with pre-existing diabetes and gestational diabetes. There appear to be no major safety concerns and so it seems reasonable to continue insulin glargine if required to achieve excellent glycaemic control. A head-to-head comparison between insulin detemir and NPH insulin in women with type 1 diabetes showed that while foetal outcomes did not differ, fasting plasma glucose improved with insulin detemir without an increased incidence of hypoglycaemia. The greater evidence base supports the use of insulin detemir as the first line long-acting analogue in pregnancy but the lack of definitive foetal benefits means that there is no strong need to switch a woman who is well controlled on NPH insulin. There seems little justification in using long acting insulin analogues in women with gestational diabetes or type 2 diabetes where the risk of hypoglycaemia is low.
23572520	S-nitrosation of glutathione transferase P1-1 is controlled by the conformation of a dynamic active-site helix.	S-nitrosation is a post-translational modification of protein cysteine residues which occurs in response to cellular oxidative stress. Although it is increasingly being linked to physiologically important processes, the molecular basis for protein regulation by this modification remains poorly understood. We used transient kinetic methods to determine a minimal mechanism for spontaneous GSNO-mediated transnitrosation of human glutathione transferase (GST) P1-1, a major detoxification enzyme and key regulator of cell proliferation. C47 of GSTP1-1 is S-nitrosated in two steps, with the chemical step limited by a pre-equilibrium between the open and closed conformations of helix α2 at the active site. C101, in contrast, is S-nitrosated in a single step but is subject to negative cooperativity due to steric hindrance at the dimer interface. Despite the presence of a GSNO binding site at the active site of GSTP1-1, isothermal titration calorimetry as well as nitrosation experiments using CysNO demonstrate that GSNO binding does not precede S-nitrosation of GSTP1-1. Kinetics experiments using the cellular reductant GSH show that C101-NO is substantially more resistant to denitrosation than C47-NO, suggesting a potential role for C101-NO in long term nitric oxide storage or transfer. These results constitute the first report of the molecular mechanism of spontaneous protein transnitrosation, providing insight into the post-translational control of GSTP1-1 as well as the process of protein transnitrosation in general.
1600046	Review article: 5-hydroxytryptamine agonists and antagonists in the modulation of gastrointestinal motility and sensation: clinical implications.	Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) is found in the enteric nervous system where it has been implicated in controlling gastrointestinal motor function. A number of receptor or recognition sites have been identified in the gut, but recently most attention has focused on the 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptors. The functional role of the 5-HT3 receptor remains incompletely understood, but it is probably involved in the modulation of colonic motility and visceral pain in the gut. A number of selective 5-HT3 antagonists have been developed including ondansetron, granisetron, tropisetron renzapride and zacopride. While the substituted benzamide prokinetics (for example, metoclopramide, cisapride) also block 5-HT3 receptors in high concentrations, their prokinetic action is believed to be on the basis of their agonist effects on the putative 5-HT4 receptor. Some 5-HT3 antagonists have 5-HT4 agonist activity (for example, renzapride, zacopride) and others do not (for example, ondansetron, granisetron), while tropisetron in high concentrations is a 5-HT4 antagonist. Based on the pharmacological data, it has been suggested that specific 5-HT antagonists and agonists may prove to be beneficial in a number of gastrointestinal disorders including the irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, non-cardiac chest pain, gastrooesophageal reflux and refractory nausea. In this review, the rationale for the use of these compounds is discussed, and the available experimental evidence is summarized.
15606893	Characterization of an allosteric citalopram-binding site at the serotonin transporter.	The serotonin transporter (SERT), which belongs to a family of sodium/chloride-dependent transporters, is the major pharmacological target in the treatment of several clinical disorders, including depression and anxiety. In the present study we show that the dissociation rate, of [3H]S-citalopram from human SERT, is retarded by the presence of serotonin, as well as by several antidepressants, when present in the dissociation buffer. Dissociation of [3H]S-citalopram from SERT is most potently inhibited by S-citalopram followed by R-citalopram, sertraline, serotonin and paroxetine. EC50 values for S- and R-citalopram are 3.6 +/- 0.4 microm and 19.4 +/- 2.3 microm, respectively. Fluoxetine, venlafaxine and duloxetine have no significant effect on the dissociation of [3H]S-citalopram. Allosteric modulation of dissociation is independent of temperature, or the presence of Na+ in the dissociation buffer. Dissociation of [3H]S-citalopram from a complex with the SERT double-mutant, N208Q/N217Q, which has been suggested to be unable to self-assemble into oligomeric complexes, is retarded to an extent similar to that found with the wild-type, raising the possibility that the allosteric mechanism is mediated within a single subunit. A species-scanning mutagenesis study comparing human and bovine SERT revealed that Met180, Tyr495 and Ser513 are important residues in mediating the allosteric effect, as well as contributing to high-affinity binding at the primary site.
23266271	Radioprotection by two phenolic compounds: chlorogenic and quinic acid, on X-ray induced DNA damage in human blood lymphocytes in vitro.	The present study was designed to determine the radioprotective effect of two phytochemicals, namely, quinic acid and chlorogenic acid, against X-ray irradiation-induced genomic instability in non-tumorigenic human blood lymphocytes. The protective ability of two phenolic acids against radiation-induced DNA damage was assessed using the alkaline comet assay in human blood lymphocytes isolated from two healthy human donors. A Siemens Mevatron MD2 (Siemens AG, USA, 1994) linear accelerator was used for irradiation. The results of the alkaline comet assay revealed that quinic acid and chlorogenic acid decreased the DNA damage induced by X-ray irradiation and provided a significant radioprotective effect. Quinic acid decreased the presence of irradiation-induced DNA damage by 5.99-53.57% and chlorogenic acid by 4.49-48.15%, as determined by the alkaline comet assay. The results show that quinic acid and chlorogenic acid may act as radioprotective compounds. Future studies should focus on determining the mechanism by which these phenolic acids provide radioprotection.
15680473	Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide potentiates spinal glutamatergic sympathoexcitation in anesthetized rats.	Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) is widely expressed in the rat central nervous system, notably in areas involved in control of autonomic and neuroendocrine functions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of CART peptide fragment 55-102, referred to herein as CARTp, by intrathecal injection on blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) before and after intrathecal glutamate in urethane-anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats. CARTp (0.1-10 nmol) administered intrathecally caused no or a small, statistically insignificant increase of blood pressure and heart rate, except at the concentration of 10 nmol, which caused a significant increase of blood pressure and heart rate. Intrathecal glutamate (0.1-10 nmol) produced a dose-dependent increase in arterial pressure and heart rate. Pretreatment with CARTp dose-dependently potentiated the pressor effects of glutamate (1 nmol), which by itself elicited a moderate increase of blood pressure and heart rate. Further, CARTp significantly potentiated the tachycardic effect of glutamate at 1 and 5 nmol, but attenuated the response at 10 nmol. The effect of CARTp was long-lasting, as it enhanced glutamatergic responses up to 90 min after administration. Prior injection of CARTp antiserum (1:500) but not normal rabbit serum nullified the potentiating effect of CARTp on glutamatergic responses. The result suggests that CARTp, whose immunoreactivity is detectable in sympathetic preganglionic neurons as well as in fibers projecting into the intermediolateral cell column, augments spinal sympathetic outflow elicited by glutamate at lower concentrations and may directly excite neurons in the intermediolateral cell column at higher concentrations.
10864881	Betaxolol, a beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, reduces Na(+) influx into cortical synaptosomes by direct interaction with Na(+) channels: comparison with other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists.	Betaxolol, a beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist used for the treatment of glaucoma, is known to be neuroprotective in paradigms of ischaemia/excitotoxicity. In this study, we examined whether betaxolol and other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists interact directly with neurotoxin binding to sites 1 and 2 of the voltage-sensitive sodium channel (Na(+) channel) in rat cerebrocortical synaptosomes. Betaxolol inhibited specific [(3)H]-batrachotoxinin-A 20-alpha-benzoate ([(3)H]-BTX-B) binding to neurotoxin site 2 in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC(50) value of 9.8 microM. Comparison of all the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists tested revealed a potency order of propranolol>betaxolol approximately levobetaxolol>levobunolol approximately carteolol>/=timolol>atenolol. None of the drugs caused a significant inhibition of [(3)H]-saxitoxin binding to neurotoxin receptor site 1, even at concentrations as high as 250 microM. Saturation experiments showed that betaxolol increased the K(D) of [(3)H]-BTX-B binding but had no effect on the B(max). The association kinetics of [(3)H]-BTX-B were unaffected by betaxolol, but the drug significantly accelerated the dissociation rate of the radioligand. These findings argue for a competitive, indirect, allosteric mode of inhibition of [(3)H]-BTX-B binding by betaxolol. Betaxolol inhibited veratridine-stimulated Na(+) influx in rat cortical synaptosomes with an IC(50) value of 28. 3 microM. Carteolol, levobunolol, timolol and atenolol were significantly less effective than betaxolol at reducing veratridine-evoked Na(+) influx. The ability of betaxolol to interact with neurotoxin site 2 of the Na(+) channel and inhibit Na(+) influx may have a role in its neuroprotective action in paradigms of excitotoxicity/ischaemia and in its therapeutic effect in glaucoma.
11078056	Biochemistry of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors and molecular pathology of COX-2 in neoplasia.	Several types of human tumors overexpress cyclooxygenase (COX) -2 but not COX-1, and gene knockout transfection experiments demonstrate a central role of COX-2 in experimental tumorigenesis. COX-2 produces prostaglandins that inhibit apoptosis and stimulate angiogenesis and invasiveness. Selective COX-2 inhibitors reduce prostaglandin synthesis, restore apoptosis, and inhibit cancer cell proliferation. In animal studies they limit carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis. In contrast, aspirin-like nonselective NSAIDs such as sulindac and indomethacin inhibit not only the enzymatic action of the highly inducible, proinflammatory COX-2 but the constitutively expressed, cytoprotective COX-1 as well. Consequently, nonselective NSAIDs can cause platelet dysfunction, gastrointestinal ulceration, and kidney damage. For that reason, selective inhibition of COX-2 to treat neoplastic proliferation is preferable to nonselective inhibition. Selective COX-2 inhibitors, such as meloxicam, celecoxib (SC-58635), and rofecoxib (MK-0966), are NSAIDs that have been modified chemically to preferentially inhibit COX-2 but not COX-1. For instance, meloxicam inhibits the growth of cultured colon cancer cells (HCA-7 and Moser-S) that express COX-2 but has no effect on HCT-116 tumor cells that do not express COX-2. NS-398 induces apoptosis in COX-2 expressing LNCaP prostate cancer cells and, surprisingly, in colon cancer S/KS cells that does not express COX-2. This effect may due to induction of apoptosis through uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and down-regulation of Bcl-2, as has been demonstrated for some nonselective NSAIDs, for instance, flurbiprofen. COX-2 mRNA and COX-2 protein is constitutively expressed in the kidney, brain, spinal cord, and ductus deferens, and in the uterus during implantation. In addition, COX-2 is constitutively and dominantly expressed in the pancreatic islet cells. These findings might somewhat limit the use of presently available selective COX-2 inhibitors in cancer prevention but will probably not deter their successful application for the treatment of human cancers.
9145928	Study of the interaction between aryloxypropanolamines and Asn386 in helix VII of the human 5-hydroxytryptamine1A receptor.	We studied the stereoselective interaction between aryloxypropanolamines and the human 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) receptor. R- and S-enantiomers of propranolol, penbutolol, and alprenolol were investigated for their ability to bind to human 5-HT1A wild-type and Asn386Val mutant receptors. Asn386 seemed to act as a chiral discriminator. Although both aryloxypropanol enantiomers displayed lower affinity for the mutant receptors, the affinities for the S-enantiomers were more affected. Receptor affinities of other structurally unrelated 5-HT1A ligands were not decreased by the mutation of Asn386 to valine. In addition, a series of analogues of propranolol with structural variation in the oxypropanolamine moiety was synthesized, and affinities for wild-type and Asn386Val mutant 5-HT1A receptors were determined. Both the hydroxyl and the ether oxygen atoms of the oxypropanol moiety seem to be required for binding at wild-type 5-HT1A receptors. The hydroxyl group of propranolol probably directly interacts with Asn386. The ether oxygen atom may be important for steric reasons but can also be involved in a direct interaction with Asn386. These findings are in agreement with the interactions of aryloxypropanolamines with Asn386 in rat 5-HT1A receptors that we previously proposed. The loss of affinity for propranolol by the Asn386Val mutation could be regained by replacement of the hydroxyl group of the ligand by a methoxy group. This modification of the propranolol structure has no effect on the affinity of both enantiomers for the wild-type 5-HT1A receptor, which provides an alternative hypothesis for the interaction of Asn386 with the oxypropanol oxygen atoms. According to this novel hypothesis, the oxypropanol oxygen atoms may both act as hydrogen bond acceptors from the NH2 group of Asn386.
23493374	Creb1-Mecp2-(m)CpG complex transactivates postnatal murine neuronal glucose transporter isoform 3 expression.	The murine neuronal facilitative glucose transporter isoform 3 (Glut3) is developmentally regulated, peaking in expression at postnatal day (PN)14. In the present study, we characterized a canonical CpG island spanning the 5'-flanking region of the glut3 gene. Methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing identified methylation of this CpG ((m)CpG) island of the glut3 gene, frequency of methylation increasing 2.5-fold with a 1.6-fold increase in DNA methyl transferase 3a concentrations noted with advancing postnatal age (PN14 vs PN3). 5'-flanking region of glut3-luciferase reporter transient transfection in HT22 hippocampal neurons demonstrated that (m)CpGs inhibit glut3 transcription. Contrary to this biological function, glut3 expression rises synchronously with (m)CpGs in PN14 vs PN3 neurons. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (IP) revealed that methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (Mecp2) bound the glut3-(m)CpGs. Depending on association with specific coregulators, Mecp2, a dual regulator of gene transcription, may repress or activate a downstream gene. Sequential chromatin IP uncovered the glut3-(m)CpGs to bind Mecp2 exponentially upon recruitment of Creb1 rather than histone deacetylase 1. Co-IP and coimmunolocalization confirmed that Creb1 associated with Mecp2 and cotransfection with glut3-(m)CpG in HT22 cells enhanced glut3 transcription. Separate 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine pretreatment or in combination with trichostatin A reduced (m)CpG and specific small interference RNAs targeting Mecp2 and Creb1 separately or together depleting Mecp2 and/or Creb1 binding of glut3-(m)CpGs reduced glut3 expression in HT22 cells. We conclude that Glut3 is a methylation-sensitive neuronal gene that recruits Mecp2. Recruitment of Creb1-Mecp2 by glut3-(m)CpG contributes towards transactivation, formulating an escape from (m)CpG-induced gene suppression, and thereby promoting developmental neuronal glut3 gene transcription and expression.
15126366	Characterization of the interaction of ingenol 3-angelate with protein kinase C.	Ingenol 3-angelate (I3A) is one of the active ingredients in Euphorbia peplus, which has been used in traditional medicine. Here, we report the initial characterization of I3A as a protein kinase C (PKC) ligand. I3A bound to PKC-alpha in the presence of phosphatidylserine with high affinity; however, under these assay conditions, little PKC isoform selectivity was observed. PKC isoforms did show different sensitivity and selectivity for down-regulation by I3A and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in WEHI-231, HOP-92, and Colo-205 cells. In all of the three cell types, I3A inhibited cell proliferation with somewhat lower potency than did PMA. In intact CHO-K1 cells, I3A was able to translocate different green fluorescent protein-tagged PKC isoforms, visualized by confocal microscopy, with equal or higher potency than PMA. PKC-delta in particular showed a different pattern of translocation in response to I3A and PMA. I3A induced a higher level of secretion of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 compared with PMA in the WEHI-231 cells and displayed a marked biphasic dose-response curve for the induction. I3A was unable to cause the same extent of association of the C1b domain of PKC-delta with lipids, compared with PMA or the physiological regulator diacylglycerol, and was able to partially block the association induced by these agents, measured by surface plasmon resonance. The in vitro kinase activity of PKC-alpha induced by I3A was lower than that induced by PMA. The novel pattern of behavior of I3A makes it of great interest for further evaluation.
23301860	Single-walled carbon nanotube surface control of complement recognition and activation.	Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are receiving considerable attention in site-specific drug and nucleic acid delivery, photodynamic therapy, and photoacoustic molecular imaging. Despite these advances, nanotubes may activate the complement system (an integral part of innate immunity), which can induce clinically significant anaphylaxis. We demonstrate that single-walled CNTs coated with human serum albumin activate the complement system through C1q-mediated classical and the alternative pathways. Surface coating with methoxypoly(ethylene glycol)-based amphiphiles, which confers solubility and prolongs circulation profiles of CNTs, activates the complement system differently, depending on the amphiphile structure. CNTs with linear poly(ethylene glycol) amphiphiles trigger the lectin pathway of the complement through both L-ficolin and mannan-binding lectin recognition. The lectin pathway activation, however, did not trigger the amplification loop of the alternative pathway. An amphiphile with branched poly(ethylene glycol) architecture also activated the lectin pathway but only through L-ficolin recognition. Importantly, this mode of activation neither generated anaphylatoxins nor induced triggering of the effector arm of the complement system. These observations provide a major step toward nanomaterial surface modification with polymers that have the properties to significantly improve innate immunocompatibility by limiting the formation of complement C3 and C5 convertases.
23363575	TCDD and corticosterone on testicular steroidogenesis and antioxidant system of epididymal sperm in rats.	2,3,7,8-Tetrachloro dibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), an endocrine-disrupting environmental pollutant, has been found to cause male reproductive toxicity. Glucocorticoids have been found to influence the metabolic pathway of TCDD. Stress, which affects the male reproductive function, is marked by an increase in the level and activity of glucocorticoids in the body. The present study was carried out to understand the effect of TCDD on testicular steroidogenesis and sperm antioxidant system under the influence of increased level of corticosterone in the body. Adult male rats were treated with either TCDD (100 ng/kg bw/ day) or corticosterone (3 mg/kg bw/day) or both for 15 days. Treatment with either TCDD or corticosterone was found to suppress the levels of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein and androgen-binding protein and reduce the activities of steroidogenic enzymes in testis while increasing oxidative stress in ventral prostate, seminal vesicles and epididymal sperm. In rats treated with both TCDD and corticosterone, the suppression of testicular steroidogenesis and increase in oxidative stress observed in ventral prostate, seminal vesicles and epididymal sperm were significant as compared to TCDD alone treated rats. The levels of Fas and FasL proteins were also increased in rats subjected to either TCDD or corticosterone treatment. In rats treated with both compounds, the increase observed in testicular levels of Fas and FasL was significant as compared to TCDD alone treated rats. Effect of TCDD on testicular steroidogenesis and antioxidant system of epididymal sperm may get enhanced under increased level of glucocorticoids in the body.
23349524	The role of GH in adipose tissue: lessons from adipose-specific GH receptor gene-disrupted mice.	GH receptor (GHR) gene-disrupted mice (GHR-/-) have provided countless discoveries as to the numerous actions of GH. Many of these discoveries highlight the importance of GH in adipose tissue. For example GHR-/- mice are insulin sensitive yet obese with preferential enlargement of the sc adipose depot. GHR-/- mice also have elevated levels of leptin, resistin, and adiponectin, compared with controls leading some to suggest that GH may negatively regulate certain adipokines. To help clarify the role that GH exerts specifically on adipose tissue in vivo, we selectively disrupted GHR in adipose tissue to produce Fat GHR Knockout (FaGHRKO) mice. Surprisingly, FaGHRKOs shared only a few characteristics with global GHR-/- mice. Like the GHR-/- mice, FaGHRKO mice are obese with increased total body fat and increased adipocyte size. However, FaGHRKO mice have increases in all adipose depots with no improvements in measures of glucose homeostasis. Furthermore, resistin and adiponectin levels in FaGHRKO mice are similar to controls (or slightly decreased) unlike the increased levels found in GHR-/- mice, suggesting that GH does not regulate these adipokines directly in adipose tissue in vivo. Other features of FaGHRKO mice include decreased levels of adipsin, a near-normal GH/IGF-1 axis, and minimal changes to a large assortment of circulating factors that were measured such as IGF-binding proteins. In conclusion, specific removal of GHR in adipose tissue is sufficient to increase adipose tissue and decrease circulating adipsin. However, removal of GHR in adipose tissue alone is not sufficient to increase levels of resistin or adiponectin and does not alter glucose metabolism.
23410798	Spiro heterocycles as potential inhibitors of SIRT1: Pd/C-mediated synthesis of novel N-indolylmethyl spiroindoline-3,2'-quinazolines.	Novel N-indolylmethyl substituted spiroindoline-3,2'-quinazolines were designed as potential inhibitiors of SIRT1. These compounds were synthesized in good yields by using Pd/C-Cu mediated coupling-cyclization strategy as a key step involving the reaction of 1-(prop-2-ynyl)-1'H-spiro[indoline-3,2'-quinazoline]-2,4'(3'H)-dione with 2-iodoanilides. Some of the compounds synthesized have shown encouraging inhibition of Sir 2 protein (a yeast homologue of mammalian SIRT1) in vitro and three of them showed dose dependent inhibition of Sir 2. The docking results suggested that the benzene ring of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinazolin ring system of these molecules occupied the deep hydrophobic pocket of the protein and one of the NH along with the sulfonyl group participated in strong H-bonding interaction with the amino acid residues.
17662248	Stimulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors modulates Jurkat T cell growth and adhesion to fibronectin.	The aims of this study were to investigate the expression and the functional roles of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in leukemic Jurkat T cells. RT-PCR and immunofluorescence/confocal microscopy analysis showed that Jurkat T cells express the NR1 and NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptors. Exposure of Jurkat cells to either (5S,10R)-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,b]cyclohepten-5,10-imine [(+)-MK 801] or D-(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (D-AP5), two selective NMDA receptor antagonists, limited cell growth by inhibiting cell cycle progression and inducing apoptosis, whereas l-glutamate (1 microM) and NMDA (10 microM) significantly increased (137.2+/-22.0%; P<0.01) Jurkat T cell adhesion to fibronectin. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that Jurkat T cells express NMDA receptors functionally active in controlling cell growth and adhesion to fibronectin.
12826271	Diclofenac inhibits proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells.	Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used in clinical situations as anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic drugs. However, it is still unknown whether NSAIDs have effects on the development of the central nervous system. In the present study, we investigated the effects of NSAIDs on neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation and differentiation into neurons. In contrast to aspirin, naproxen, indomethacin and ibuprofen, treatment with diclofenac (10 microM) for 2 days induced the death of NSCs in a concentration-dependent manner. Diclofenac also inhibited the proliferation of NSCs and their differentiation into neurons. Treatment with diclofenac resulted in nuclear condensation (a morphological change due to apoptosis of NSCs) 24hr after the treatment and activated caspase-3 after 6 hr, indicating that diclofenac may cause apoptosis of neuronal cells via activation of the caspase cascade. These results suggest that diclofenac may affect the development of the central nervous system.
16617454	Airway inflammation in asymptomatic children with episodic wheeze.	Airway pathologies have been comprehensively researched in adult asthma, but in children, the extent of airway inflammation associated with episodic wheeze, often diagnosed as asthma, has not been fully characterized. It is not clear whether persistent airway inflammation is present in the absence of wheezing symptoms, and there is controversy regarding the role of age and atopy. This study assessed cellular and cytokine markers of airway inflammation in asymptomatic children with a history of episodic wheeze. Children with a history of episodic wheeze and cough (study group) and nonasthmatic patients requiring elective surgery (control group) were recruited. All subjects in the study group had a history of significant episodic wheezing (>2 episodes per year), and used only as-needed beta-agonist treatment. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was obtained using bronchoscopic lavage (study group) and nonbronchoscopic lavage (control group). Differential cell counts of BAL and flow cytometry were performed to identify T-lymphocyte phenotypes, and intracellular cytokine profiles were measured after phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulation of BAL fluid T-cells. Twenty-one children with a history of 2-12 episodes of wheeze per year and 21 nonasthmatic subjects without respiratory symptoms were recruited. Study and control subjects were matched for age (median age, 5 years) and demographic characteristics. Study subjects had higher IgE levels, but their measurements were still within normal range. No significant differences in BAL differential cell counts were noted, and in both groups, the majority of T-cells were CD3+ CD8+, with a median CD4:CD8 ratio of 0.6. There was no significant difference in T-cell expression of the activation markers HLA-DR and CD25 (IL-2 receptor), or in PMA-induced production of the intracellular cytokines IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10. The results of this study suggest that significant T-cell-driven airway inflammation is absent in mild or nonatopic, asymptomatic children of this age group who have episodic wheeze. Our findings support asthma management guidelines that do not recommend long-term treatment of this group of patients with anti-inflammatory medications.
11422746	Fibroblast growth factor receptors and their ligands in the adult rat kidney.	BACKGROUND: Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are a family of at least 21 heparin-binding proteins involved in many biological processes, both during development and in the adult, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and angiogenesis. FGFs mediate their effects through high-affinity tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFRs), which are encoded by four genes. The aims of the present study were to localize FGFR-1 through FGFR-3 in the normal adult rat kidney and to determine which functional FGFR variants and FGFs were expressed. METHODS: Avidin-biotin-enhanced horseradish peroxidase immunohistochemistry was used on paraffin sections of rat kidney to localize FGFR-1 through FGFR-3, whereas reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used to examine expression of the receptor variants and also of FGF-1 through FGF-10 in cortex, outer medulla, and inner medulla. RESULTS: By immunohistochemistry, each receptor was localized to distinct and overlapping nephron segments, such that one or more FGFRs were localized to all nephron and collecting duct epithelia. FGFR-1 and FGFR-3 were localized to glomeruli, FGFR-3 to proximal tubules and FGFR-1 to thin limbs. FGFR-1 through FGFR-3 were localized to distal straight tubules, with FGFR-1 and FGFR-3 localized to distal convoluted tubules. FGFR-1 and FGFR-3 were localized to medullary collecting ducts. In addition, FGFR-1 was localized to the smooth muscle of renal arteries. All seven FGFR variants were expressed in the cortex and outer medulla, with fewer FGFRs in the inner medulla. FGF-1, FGF-2, FGF-7, FGF-8, and FGF-9 were expressed in the kidney, with FGF-10 expression found only in the cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Mapping of these receptors is critical to the determination of the effects of FGF ligands in discrete regions of the kidney. The distributions of the FGFRs in the normal adult kidney and the restricted expression of FGF ligands suggest that specific FGFs have distinct and important roles in the maintenance of normal kidney structure and function.
23639192	Puerarin stimulates proliferation and differentiation and protects against cell death in human osteoblastic MG-63 cells via ER-dependent MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt activation.	Puerarin, the main isoflavone glycoside found in the Chinese herb radix of Pueraria lobata (Willd.) Ohwi, has received increasing attention because of its possible role in the prevention of osteoporosis. Previously, we showed that puerarin could inhibit the bone absorption of osteoclasts and promote long bone growth in fetal mouse in vitro. Further study confirmed that puerarin stimulated proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts in rat. However, the mechanisms underlying its actions on human bone cells have not been well defined. Here we show that puerarin increases proliferation and differentiation and opposes cisplatin-induced apoptosis in human osteoblastic MG-63 cells containing two estrogen receptor (ER) isoforms. Puerarin promotes proliferation by altering cell cycle distribution whereas puerarin-mediated survival may be associated with up-regulation of Bcl-xL expression. Treatment with the ER antagonist ICI 182,780 abolishes the above actions of puerarin on osteoblast-derived cells. Using small interfering double-stranded RNA technology, we further demonstrate that the effects of puerarin on proliferation, differentiation and survival are mediated by both ERα and ERβ. Moreover, we also demonstrate that puerarin functions at least partially through activation of MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling. This agent also shows much weaker effect on breast epithelial cell growth than that of estrogen. Therefore, puerarin will be a promising agent that prevents or retards osteoporosis.
23301766	Improved self-healing of polyethylene/carbon black nanocomposites by their shape memory effect.	In this work, the improved self-healing of cross-linked polyethylene (PE) (cPE)/carbon black (CB) nanocomposites by their shape memory effect (SME) is investigated. CB nanoparticles are found to be homogeneously dispersed in the PE matrix and significantly increase the strength of the materials. Compared with the breaking of linear PE (lPE) at the melting temperature (T(m)), the cPE and cPE/CB nanocomposites still have high strength above T(m) due to the formation of networks. The cPE and cPE/CB nanocomposites show both high strain fixity ratio (R(f)) and high strain recovery ratio (R(r)). Crystallization-induced elongation is observed for all the prepared shape memory polymer (SMP) materials and the effect becomes less remarkable with increasing volume fraction of CB nanoparticles (v(CB)). The scratch self-healing tests show that the cross-linking of PE matrix, the addition of CB nanoparticles, and the previous stretching in the direction perpendicular to the scratch favor the closure of the scratch and its complete healing. This SME-aided self-healing could have potential applications in diverse fields such as coating and structure materials.
16474853	Preclinical and clinical development of the oral multikinase inhibitor sorafenib in cancer treatment.	Tumor survival, growth and metastasis depend on efficient tumor cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis, and targeting both of these processes simultaneously could prove to be therapeutically relevant. The RAS/RAF signaling pathway is an important mediator of tumor cell proliferation, and angiogenesis and is often aberrantly activated in human tumors due to the presence of activated Ras or mutant B-Raf, or elevation of growth factor receptors. Sorafenib, which belongs chemically to a class that can be described as bis-aryl ureas, was selected for further pharmacologic characterization based on potent inhibition of Raf-1 and its favorable kinase selectivity profile. Further characterization showed that sorafenib suppresses both wild-type and V599E mutant B-Raf activity in vitro. In addition, sorafenib demonstrated significant activity against several receptor tyrosine kinases involved in neovascularization and tumor progression, including vascular-endothelial growth factor (VEGFR)-2, VEGFR-3, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFR)-beta Flt-3, and c-KIT. Preclinically, sorafenib showed broad-spectrum antitumor activity in colon, breast and non-small-cell lung cancer xenograft models. A total of four phase I studies using oral sorafenib as a single agent have been completed, and the compound showed a favorable safety profile with mild to moderate diarrhea being the most common treatment-related adverse event. The maximum tolerated dose was 400 mg b.i.d. continuous. Single-agent phase II trials reported so far demonstrated antitumor activity of sorafenib in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, sarcoma and renal cell cancer (RCC). Based on phase II results in RCC patients, a placebo-controlled phase III study was performed, which randomized a total of 905 patients, most of whom were treated previously. The partial response rate was 2% for sorafenib and 0% for placebo. Stable disease was observed in 78% and 55% of patients on sorafenib and placebo, respectively. Sorafenib significantly prolonged median progression-free survival (24 weeks) compared with placebo (12 weeks) in all subsets of patients evaluated. Approval of sorafenib by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for this indication is pending. A first-line phase III study in RCC as well as phase III studies in hepatocellular carcinoma and metastatic melanoma have been initiated.
22750078	The novel phosphodiesterase 10A inhibitor THPP-1 has antipsychotic-like effects in rat and improves cognition in rat and rhesus monkey.	Phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) is a novel target for the treatment of schizophrenia that may address multiple symptomatic domains associated with this disorder. PDE10A is highly expressed in the brain and functions to metabolically inactivate the important second messengers cAMP and cGMP. Here we describe effects of a potent and orally bioavailable PDE10A inhibitor [2-(6-chloropyridin-3-yl)-4-(2-methoxyethoxy)-7,8-dihydropyrido[4,3-d]pyrimidin-6(5H)-yl](imidazo[1,5-a]pyridin-1-yl)methanone] (THPP-1) on striatal signaling pathways, in behavioral tests that predict antipsychotic potential, and assays that measure episodic-like memory in rat and executive function in rhesus monkey. THPP-1 exhibits nanomolar potency on the PDE10A enzyme, demonstrates excellent pharmacokinetic properties in multiple preclinical animal species, and is selective for PDE10A over other PDE families of enzymes. THPP-1 significantly increased phosphorylation of proteins in the striatum involved in synaptic plasticity, including the a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionic acid receptor (AMPA) GluR1 subunit, extracellular receptor kinase (ERK), and cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB). THPP-1 produced dose-dependent effects in preclinical assays predictive of antipsychotic activity including attenuation of MK-801-induced psychomotor activation and condition avoidance responding in rats. At similar plasma exposures, THPP-1 significantly increased object recognition memory in rat and attenuated a ketamine-induced deficit in the object retrieval detour task in rhesus monkey. These findings suggest that PDE10A inhibitors have the potential to impact multiple symptomatic domains of schizophrenia including positive symptoms and cognitive impairment.

12407077	Probing an open CFTR pore with organic anion blockers.	The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an ion channel that conducts Cl- current. We explored the CFTR pore by studying voltage-dependent blockade of the channel by two organic anions: glibenclamide and isethionate. To simplify the kinetic analysis, a CFTR mutant, K1250A-CFTR, was used because this mutant channel, once opened, can remain open for minutes. Dose-response relationships of both blockers follow a simple Michaelis-Menten function with K(d) values that differ by three orders of magnitude. Glibenclamide blocks CFTR from the intracellular side of the membrane with slow kinetics. Both the on and off rates of glibenclamide block are voltage dependent. Removing external Cl- increases affinity of glibenclamide due to a decrease of the off rate and an increase of the on rate, suggesting the presence of a Cl- binding site external to the glibenclamide binding site. Isethionate blocks the channel from the cytoplasmic side with fast kinetics, but has no measurable effect when applied extracellularly. Increasing the internal Cl- concentration reduces isethionate block without affecting its voltage dependence, suggesting that Cl- and isethionate compete for a binding site in the pore. The voltage dependence and external Cl- concentration dependence of isethionate block are nearly identical to those of glibenclamide block, suggesting that these two blockers may bind to a common binding site, an idea further supported by kinetic studies of blocking with glibenclamide/isethionate mixtures. By comparing the physical and chemical natures of these two blockers, we propose that CFTR channel has an asymmetric pore with a wide internal entrance and a deeply embedded blocker binding site where local charges as well as hydrophobic components determine the affinity of the blockers.
23583258	Phenolic compounds present in Sardinian wine extracts protect against the production of inflammatory cytokines induced by oxysterols in CaCo-2 human enterocyte-like cells.	Cholesterol auto-oxidation products, namely oxysterols, are widely present in cholesterol-rich foods. They are thought to potentially interfere with homeostasis of the human digestive tract, playing a role in intestinal mucosal damage. This report concerns the marked up-regulation in differentiated CaCo-2 colonic epithelial cells of two key inflammatory interleukins, IL-6 and IL-8, caused by a mixture of oxysterols representative of a high cholesterol diet. This strong pro-inflammatory effect appeared to be dependent on the net imbalance of red-ox equilibrium with the production of excessive levels of reactive oxygen species through the colonic NADPH-oxidase NOX1 activation. Induction of NOX1 was markedly while not fully inhibited by CaCo-2 cell pre-incubation with phenolic extracts obtained from well-selected wines from typical grape varieties grown in Sardinia. Oxysterol-dependent NOX1 activation, as well as interleukin synthesis, were completely prevented by Cannonau red wine extract that contains an abundant phenolic fraction, in particular phenolic acids and flavonoids. Conversely, cell pre-treatment with Vermentino white wine extract with smaller phenolic fraction showed only a partial NOX1 down-regulation and was ineffective in interleukin synthesis induced by dietary oxysterols. It is thus likely that the effects of Sardinian wine extracts against intestinal inflammation induced by dietary oxysterols are mainly due to their high phenolic content: low doses of phenolics would be responsible only for direct scavenging oxysterol-dependent ROS production. Besides this direct activity, an excess of phenolic compounds detectable in red wine, may exert an additional indirect action by blocking oxysterol-related NOX1 induction, thus totally preventing the pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory events triggered by dietary oxysterols.
16897483	Two highly divergent alcohol dehydrogenases of melon exhibit fruit ripening-specific expression and distinct biochemical characteristics.	Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) participate in the biosynthetic pathway of aroma volatiles in fruit by interconverting aldehydes to alcohols and providing substrates for the formation of esters. Two highly divergent ADH genes (15% identity at the amino acid level) of Cantaloupe Charentais melon (Cucumis melo var. Cantalupensis) have been isolated. Cm-ADH1 belongs to the medium-chain zinc-binding type of ADHs and is highly similar to all ADH genes expressed in fruit isolated so far. Cm-ADH2 belongs to the short-chain type of ADHs. The two encoded proteins are enzymatically active upon expression in yeast. Cm-ADH1 has strong preference for NAPDH as a co-factor, whereas Cm-ADH2 preferentially uses NADH. Both Cm-ADH proteins are much more active as reductases with K (m)s 10-20 times lower for the conversion of aldehydes to alcohols than for the dehydrogenation of alcohols to aldehydes. They both show strong preference for aliphatic aldehydes but Cm-ADH1 is capable of reducing branched aldehydes such as 3-methylbutyraldehyde, whereas Cm-ADH2 cannot. Both Cm-ADH genes are expressed specifically in fruit and up-regulated during ripening. Gene expression as well as total ADH activity are strongly inhibited in antisense ACC oxidase melons and in melon fruit treated with the ethylene antagonist 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), indicating a positive regulation by ethylene. These data suggest that each of the Cm-ADH protein plays a specific role in the regulation of aroma biosynthesis in melon fruit.
23603339	Dehydroepiandrosterone post-transcriptionally modifies CYP1A2 induction involving androgen receptor.	The pharmacological dosage of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) protects against chemically induced carcinogenesis. The chemoprotective activity of DHEA is attributed to its inhibitory potential for the expression of CYP1A enzymes, which are highly responsible for metabolic activation of several mutagenic and carcinogenic chemicals. The present work investigated whether the chemoprevention by DHEA was due to diminished transcriptional activation of CYP1A genes or to the post-transcriptional modulation of CYP1A expression. In primary human hepatocytes, DHEA diminished the increase in CYP1A activities (7-ethoxyresorufin O-dealkylation and phenacetin O-dealkylation) and in CYP1A2 mRNA level induced by 3-methylcholanthrene, but did not alter the amount of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNA. The androgen receptor seemed to be involved in DHEA-mediated diminishment of CYP1A2 induction, which was attenuated in the presence of bicalutamide, the androgen receptor antagonist. The potential role of the glucocorticoid receptor and estrogen receptor in DHEA-mediated decrease in CYP1A2 induction was excluded. The developed computational model of CYP1A2 induction kinetics and CYP1A2 mRNA degradation proposed that a post-transcriptional mechanism was likely to be the primary mechanism of the DHEA-mediated diminishment of CYP1A2 induction. The hypothesis was confirmed by the results of actinomycin D-chase experiments in MCF-7 and LNCaP cells, displaying that the degradation rates of CYP1A2 mRNA were significantly higher in the cells exposed to DHEA. The novel findings on DHEA-mediated modulation of CYP1A2 mRNA stability may account for the beneficial effects of DHEA by decreasing the metabolic activation of pro-carcinogenic compounds.
12421359	Study of the nematode putative GABA type-A receptor subunits: evidence for modulation by ivermectin.	Two alleles of the HG1 gene, which encodes a putative GABA receptor alpha/gamma subunit, were isolated from Haemonchus contortus. These two alleles were shown previously to be associated with ivermectin susceptibility (HG1A) and resistance (HG1E), respectively. Sequence analysis indicates that they differ in four amino acids. To explore the functional properties of the two alleles, a full-length cDNA encoding the beta subunit, a key functional component of the GABA receptor, was isolated from Caenorhabditis elegans (gab-1, corresponding to the GenBank locus ZC482.1) and coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes with the HG1 alleles. When gab-1 was coexpressed with either the HG1A allele or the HG1E allele in Xenopus oocytes, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-responsive channels with different sensitivity to the agonist were formed. The effects of ivermectin on the hetero-oligomeric receptors were determined. Application of ivermectin alone had no effect on the receptors. However, when coapplied with 10 micro m GABA, ivermectin potentiated the GABA-evoked current of the GAB-1/HG1A receptor, but attenuated the GABA response of the GAB-1/HG1E receptor. We demonstrated that the coexpressed HG1 and GAB-1 receptors are GABA-responsive, and provide evidence for the possible involvement of GABA receptors in the mechanism of ivermectin resistance.
23207409	Combining QSAR classification models for predictive modeling of human monoamine oxidase inhibitors.	Due to their role in the metabolism of monoamine neurotransmitters, MAO-A and MAO-B present a significant pharmacological interest. For instance the inhibitors of human MAO-B are considered useful tools for the treatment of Parkinson Disease. Therefore, the rational design and synthesis of new MAOs inhibitors is considered of great importance for the development of new and more effective treatments of Parkinson Disease. In this work, Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSAR) has been developed to predict the human MAO inhibitory activity and selectivity. The first step was the selection of a suitable dataset of heterocyclic compounds that include chromones, coumarins, chalcones, thiazolylhydrazones, etc. These compounds were previously synthesized in one of our laboratories, or elsewhere, and their activities measured by the same assays and for the same laboratory staff. Applying linear discriminant analysis to data derived from a variety of molecular representations and feature selection algorithms, reliable QSAR models were built which could be used to predict for test compounds the inhibitory activity and selectivity toward human MAO. This work also showed how several QSAR models can be combined to make better predictions. The final models exhibit significant statistics, interpretability, as well as displaying predictive power on an external validation set made up of chromone derivatives with unknown activity (that are being reported here for first time) synthesized by our group, and coumarins recently reported in the literature.
23395171	Tmem64 modulates calcium signaling during RANKL-mediated osteoclast differentiation.	Osteoclast maturation and function primarily depend on receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL)-mediated induction of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1), which is further activated via increased intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) oscillation. However, the coordination mechanism that mediates Ca(2+) oscillation during osteoclastogenesis remains ill defined. Here, we identified transmembrane protein 64 (Tmem64) as a regulator of Ca(2+) oscillation during osteoclastogenesis. We found that Tmem64-deficient mice exhibit increased bone mass due in part to impaired osteoclast formation. Using in vitro osteoclast culture systems, we show here that Tmem64 interacts with sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase 2 (SERCA2) and modulates its activity. Consequently, Tmem64 deficiency significantly diminishes RANKL-induced [Ca(2+)](i) oscillation, which results in reduced Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMK) IV and mitochondrial ROS, both of which contribute to achieving the CREB activity necessary for osteoclast formation. These data demonstrate that Tmem64 is a positive modulator of osteoclast differentiation via SERCA2-dependent Ca(2+) signaling.
23073075	Fingolimod protects cultured cortical neurons against excitotoxic death.	Fingolimod (FTY720), a novel drug approved for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, activates different sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) subtypes. Its primary mechanism of action is to reduce the egress of T lymphocytes from secondary lymphoid organs, thus restraining neuroinflammation and autoimmunity. However, recent evidence suggests that the action of FTY720 involves S1PRs expressed by cells resident in the CNS, including neurons. Here, we examined the effect of FTY720, its active metabolite, FTY720-P, and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) on neuronal viability using a classical in vitro model of excitotoxic neuronal death. Mixed cultures of mouse cortical cells were challenged with toxic concentrations of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) for 10 min, and neuronal death was assessed 20 h later. FTY720, FTY720-P, and S1P were all neuroprotective when applied 18-20 h prior to the NMDA pulse. Neuroprotection was attenuated by pertussis toxin, and inhibited by the selective type-1 S1PR (S1P1R) antagonist, W146, and by inhibitors of the mitogen associated protein kinase (MAPK) and the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PtdIns-3-K) pathways. Both FTY720 and FTY720-P retained their protective activity in pure cultures of mouse or rat cortical neurons. These data offer the first direct demonstration that FTY720 and its active metabolite protect neurons against excitotoxic death.
23131798	Discovery of novel cannabinoid receptor ligands by a virtual screening approach: further development of 2,4,6-trisubstituted 1,3,5-triazines as CB2 agonists.	3D ligand-based virtual screening was employed to identify novel scaffolds for cannabinoid receptor ligand development. A total of 112 compounds with diverse structures were purchased from commercial vendors. 12 CB1 receptor antagonists/inverse agonists and 10 CB2 receptor agonists were identified in vitro. One of the CB2 agonists, N-cyclopentyl-4-ethoxy-6-(4-methylpiperidin-1-yl)-1,3,5-triazin-2-amine (19, -logEC(50)=7.5, E(max)=255%) was selected for further development. As far as we are aware, the compound's 1,3,5-triazine scaffold represents a new core structure for CB2 agonists. A library of fifty-seven 2,4,6-trisubstituted-1,3,5-triazines was created to clarify the structure-activity relationship study of the analogs.
23530959	Multipart Copolyelectrolyte Adhesive of the Sandcastle Worm, Phragmatopoma californica (Fewkes): Catechol Oxidase Catalyzed Curing through Peptidyl-DOPA.	Tube-building sabellariid polychaetes have major impacts on the geology and ecology of shorelines worldwide. Sandcastle worms, Phragmatopoma californica (Fewkes), live along the western coast of North America. Individual sabellariid worms build tubular shells by gluing together mineral particles with a multipart polyelectrolytic adhesive. Distinct sets of oppositely charged components are packaged and stored in concentrated granules in separate cell types. Homogeneous granules contain sulfated macromolecules as counter-polyanion to polycationic Pc2 and Pc5 proteins, which become major components of the fully cured glue. Heterogeneous granules contain polyphosphoproteins, Pc3A/B, paired with divalent cations and polycationic Pc1 and Pc4 proteins. Both types of granules contain catechol oxidase that catalyzes oxidative cross-linking of L-DOPA. Co-secretion of catechol oxidase guarantees rapid and spatially homogeneous curing with limited mixing of the preassembled adhesive packets. Catechol oxidase remains active long after the glue is fully cured, perhaps providing an active cue for conspecific larval settlement.
23085435	Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates induce apoptosis of hematopoietic tumor cells via inhibition of Ras signaling pathways and Bim-mediated activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.	Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (N-BPs) induce apoptosis in tumor cells by inhibiting the prenylation of small G-proteins. However, the details of the apoptosis-inducing mechanism remain obscure. The present study showed that the induction of apoptosis by N-BPs in hematopoietic tumor cells is mediated by mitochondrial apoptotic signaling pathways, which are activated by the suppression of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) biosynthesis. Furthermore, N-BPs decreased the levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and mTOR via suppression of Ras prenylation and enhanced Bim expression. The present results indicated that N-BPs induce apoptosis by decreasing the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, increasing the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and enhancing Bim expression through inhibition of the Ras/MEK/ERK and Ras/mTOR pathways. The accumulation of N-BPs in bones suggests that they may act more effectively on tumors that have spread to bones or on Ras-variable tumors. This is the first study to show that the specific molecular pathways of N-BP-induced apoptosis.
15114505	In vitro inhibition of diacylglycerol acyltransferase by prenylflavonoids from Sophora flavescens.	Four prenylflavonoids, kurarinone ( 1), a chalcone of 1, kuraridin ( 2), kurarinol ( 3), kushenol H ( 4) and kushenol K ( 5) isolated from the roots of Sophora flavescens were investigated for their inhibitory effects on diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT). The flavonoids inhibited DGAT activity in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 values of 10.9 microM ( 1), 9.8 microM ( 2), 8.6 microM ( 3), 142.0 microM ( 4) and 250 microM ( 5). The prenylflavonoids without C3-OH ( 1, 2, 3) showed stronger inhibition than those with C3-OH ( 4, 5). On the other hand, flavonoids without side chains (hesperetin, naringenin, quercetin and kaempferol) did not inhibit the enzyme activity at a final concentration of 800 microM. These data suggest that the lavandulyl side chain and the position of the hydroxy group are important for high DGAT inhibitory activity. Compound 1 also inhibited de novo synthesis of triacylglycerol (TG) in Raji cells.
23200945	Bradykinetic alcohol dehydrogenases make yeast fitter for growth in the presence of allyl alcohol.	"Previous studies showed that fitter yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) that can grow by fermenting glucose in the presence of allyl alcohol, which is oxidized by alcohol dehydrogenase I (ADH1) to toxic acrolein, had mutations in the ADH1 gene that led to decreased ADH activity. These yeast may grow more slowly due to slower reduction of acetaldehyde and a higher NADH/NAD(+) ratio, which should decrease the oxidation of allyl alcohol. We determined steady-state kinetic constants for three yeast ADHs with new site-directed substitutions and examined the correlation between catalytic efficiency and growth on selective media of yeast expressing six different ADHs. The H15R substitution (a test for electrostatic effects) is on the surface of ADH and has small effects on the kinetics. The H44R substitution (affecting interactions with the coenzyme pyrophosphate) was previously shown to decrease affinity for coenzymes 2-4-fold and turnover numbers (V/Et) by 4-6-fold. The W82R substitution is distant from the active site, but decreases turnover numbers by 5-6-fold, perhaps by effects on protein dynamics. The E67Q substitution near the catalytic zinc was shown previously to increase the Michaelis constant for acetaldehyde and to decrease turnover for ethanol oxidation. The W54R substitution, in the substrate binding site, increases kinetic constants (Ks, by >10-fold) while decreasing turnover numbers by 2-7-fold. Growth of yeast expressing the different ADHs on YPD plates (yeast extract, peptone and dextrose) plus antimycin to require fermentation, was positively correlated with the log of catalytic efficiency for the sequential bi reaction (V1/KiaKb=KeqV2/KpKiq, varying over 4 orders of magnitude, adjusted for different levels of ADH expression) in the order: WT≈H15R>H44R>W82R>E67Q>W54R. Growth on YPD plus 10mM allyl alcohol was inversely correlated with catalytic efficiency. The fitter yeast are ""bradytrophs"" (slow growing) because the ADHs have decreased catalytic efficiency."
15133083	Polyamine metabolism in a member of the phylum Microspora (Encephalitozoon cuniculi): effects of polyamine analogues.	The uptake, biosynthesis and catabolism of polyamines in the microsporidian parasite Encephalitozoon cuniculi are detailed with reference to the effects of oligoamine and arylamine analogues of polyamines. Enc. cuniculi, an intracellular parasite of mammalian cells, has both biosynthetic and catabolic enzymes of polyamine metabolism, as demonstrated in cell-free extracts of mature spores. The uptake of polyamines was measured in immature, pre-emergent spores isolated from host cells by Percoll gradient. Spermine was rapidly taken up and metabolized to spermidine and an unknown, possibly acetamidopropanal, by spermidine/spermine N(1)-acetyltransferase (SSAT) and polyamine oxidase (PAO). Most of the spermidine and the unknown product were found in the cell incubation medium, indicating they were released from the cell. bis(Ethyl) oligoamine analogues of polyamines, such as SL-11144 and SL-11158, as well as arylamine analogues [BW-1, a bis(phenylbenzyl) 3-7-3 analogue] blocked uptake and interconversion of spermine at micromolar levels and, in the case of BW-1, acted as substrate for PAO. The Enc. cuniculi PAO activity differed from that found in mammalian cells with respect to pH optimum, substrate specificity and sensitivity to known PAO inhibitors. SL-11158 inhibited SSAT activity with a mixed type of inhibition in which the analogue had a 70-fold higher affinity for the enzyme than the natural substrate, spermine. The interest in Enc. cuniculi polyamine metabolism and the biochemical effects of these polyamine analogues is warranted since they cure model infections of Enc. cuniculi in mice and are potential candidates for human clinical trials.
23146695	Puerarin mediates hepatoprotection against CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis rats through attenuation of inflammation response and amelioration of metabolic function.	This study was designed to evaluate the potential effects of puerarin (PR), an effective isoflavonoid compound purified from Pueraria lobata, in treating hepatic fibrosis (HF) rats induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4), 2 mL kg(-1) d(-1)). Compared to model control, PR treatment effectively lowered the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), albumin (Alb), total protein (TP) in HF rats. Masson stained analysis showed that the condition of HF rats was mitigated. Meanwhile, the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) expressions were significantly down-regulated at protein level by PR intervention. Additionally, the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was elevated, while the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) was lessened in liver tissue. As revealed by immunohistochemistry assay, PR therapy resulted in reduced production of transforming growth factor-βl (TGF-βl). Moreover, it also was attributed to decreased mRNA level of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) using RT-PCR analysis. These findings demonstrate that puerarin successfully reverses hepatotoxicity in CCl(4)-induced HF rats via the underlying mechanisms of regulating serum enzymes and attenuating TNF-α/NF-κB pathway for anti-inflammation response, as well as improving metabolic function in liver tissue.
17403374	Regulation of gluconeogenesis by Kruppel-like factor 15.	In the postabsorptive state, certain tissues, including the brain, require glucose as the sole source of energy. After an overnight fast, hepatic glycogen stores are depleted, and gluconeogenesis becomes essential for preventing life-threatening hypoglycemia. Mice with a targeted deletion of KLF15, a member of the Kruppel-like family of transcription factors, display severe hypoglycemia after an overnight (18 hr) fast. We provide evidence that defective amino acid catabolism promotes the development of fasting hypoglycemia in KLF15-/- mice by limiting gluconeogenic substrate availability. KLF15-/- liver and skeletal muscle show markedly reduced mRNA expression of amino acid-degrading enzymes. Furthermore, the enzymatic activity of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), which converts the critical gluconeogenic amino acid alanine into pyruvate, is decreased (approximately 50%) in KLF15-/- hepatocytes. Consistent with this observation, intraperitoneal injection of pyruvate, but not alanine, rescues fasting hypoglycemia in KLF15-/- mice. We conclude that KLF15 plays an important role in the regulation of gluconeogenesis.
23534412	Antithrombotic activity of a newly synthesized coumarin derivative 3-(5-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-chroman-6-yl)-N-{2-[3-(5-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-chroman-6-yl)-propionylamino]-ethyl}-propionamide.	Anti-platelet therapy is a useful strategy to prevent acute thromboembolic artery occlusions. This study was designed to assess the efficacy of seselin derivatives against murine pulmonary thromboembolism, bleeding time, platelet activation and thrombosis. Administration of C3 (16 mg/kg) offered 70% protection against collagen- and epinephrine-induced pulmonary thromboembolism and 30% protection against arachidonic acid-induced death in mice, without adversely affecting bleeding time. No significant difference was observed by C3 in ferric chloride-induced arterial thrombosis in rats. Significant reduction in thrombus weight was observed in arteriovenous shunt model. In rat PRP, C3 reduced ADP and collagen-induced platelet aggregation. In chronic hamster model of dyslipidemia, administration of C3 (16 mg/kg p.o. for 90 days) had no effect on plasma lipids, vasoreactivity and platelet adhesion. C3 fed hamsters showed reduced whole-blood aggregation response to ADP and collagen compared to HC-fed hamsters. In addition, C3 augmented thrombin time; however, time to occlusion was not increased. These results convincingly demonstrated that C3 is a novel molecule that reduces the risk of thrombosis and alleviates prothrombotic state associated with hyperlipidemia without any adverse effect on bleeding time. The high benefit/risk ratio of this compound makes it a suitable candidate for future valid studies.
8622118	Structure and pharmacological properties of a molluscan glutamate-gated cation channel and its likely role in feeding behavior.	We describe the isolation of a molluscan (Lymnaea stagnalis) full-length complementary DNA that encodes a mature polypeptide (which we have named Lym-eGluR2) with a predicted molecular weight of 105 kDa that exhibits 44-48% identity to the mammalian kainate-selective glutamate receptor GluR5, GluR6, and GluR7 subunits. Injection of in vitro-transcribed RNA from this clone into Xenopus laevis oocytes results in the robust expression of homo-oligomeric cation channels that can be gated by L-glutamate (EC50 = 1.2 +/- 0.3 micron) and several other glutamate receptor agonists; rank order of potency: glutamate >> kainate > ibotenate > AMPA. These currents can be blocked by the mammalian non-NMDA receptor antagonists 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, and 1-(4-chlorobenzoyl)piperazine-2,3-dicarboxylic acid. Ionic-replacement experiments have shown that the agonist-induced current is carried entirely by sodium and potassium ions. In situ hybridization has revealed that the Lym-eGluR2 transcript is present in all 11 ganglia of the Lymnaea CNS, including the 4-cluster motorneurons within the paired buccal ganglia. The pharmacological properties and deduced location of Lym-eGluR2 are entirely consistent with it being (a component of) the receptor, which has been identified previously on buccal motorneurons, that mediates the excitatory effects of glutamate released from neurons within the feeding central pattern generator.
23541434	Pharmacological study of a new Asp49 phospholipase A2 (Bbil-TX) isolated from Bothriopsis bilineata smargadina (forest viper) venom in vertebrate neuromuscular preparations.	The neuromuscular activity of Bbil-TX, a PLA2 with catalytic activity isolated from Bothriopsis bilineata smargadina venom, was examined in chick biventer cervicis (BC) and mouse phrenic nerve-diaphragm (PND) preparations. In BC preparations, Bbil-TX (0.5-10 μg/ml) caused time- and concentration-dependent blockade that was not reversed by washing; the times for 50% blockade were 87 ± 7, 41 ± 7 and 19 ± 2 min (mean ± SEM; n = 4-6) for 1, 5 and 10 μg/ml, respectively. Muscle contractures to exogenous ACh and KCl were unaffected. The toxin (10 μg/ml) also did not affect the twitch-tension of directly-stimulated, curarized (10 μg/ml) BC preparations. However, Bbil-TX (10 μg/ml) produced mild morphological alterations (edematous and/or hyperchromic fibers) in BC; there was also a progressive release of CK (from 116 ± 17 IU/ml (basal) to 710 ± 91 IU/ml after 45 min). Bbil-TX (5 μg/ml)-induced blockade was markedly inhibited at 22-24 °C and pretreatment with p-bromophenacyl bromide (p-BPB) abolished the neuromuscular blockade. Bbil-TX (3-30 μg/ml, n = 4-6) caused partial time- and concentration-dependent blockade in PND preparations (52 ± 2% at the highest concentration). Bbil-TX (30 μg/ml) also markedly reduced the MEPPs frequency [from 26 ± 2.5 (basal) to 10 ± 1 after 60 min; n = 5; p < 0.05] and the quantal content [from 94 ± 14 (basal) to 24 ± 3 after 60 min; n = 5; p < 0.05] of PND preparations, but caused only minor depolarization of the membrane resting potential [from -80 ± 1 mV (basal) to -66 ± 2 mV after 120 min; n = 5; p < 0.05], with no significant change in the depolarizing response to exogenous carbachol. These results show that Bbil-TX is a presynaptic PLA2 that contributes to the neuromuscular blockade caused by B. b. smargadina venom.
15306222	Carvedilol selectively inhibits oscillatory intracellular calcium changes evoked by human alpha1D- and alpha1B-adrenergic receptors.	BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence from clinical trials indicates that carvedilol, an antagonist of alpha1- and beta-adrenergic receptors (ARs), provides an effective treatment for chronic heart failure, whereas nonselective alpha1-AR blockade has an adverse outcome in this disease. It is, however, not clear whether carvedilol exhibits a subtype-dependent impact on three distinct alpha1-adrenergic receptors (alpha1-ARs). METHODS AND RESULTS: We determined binding properties of human ARs for carvedilol using HEK293 human embryonic kidney cells expressing a single AR subtype. Our results showed that the affinities of alpha1D-AR and alpha1B-AR for carvedilol are higher than that of the beta1-AR subtype, a major target in heart failure treatment. The affinity rank order and pKi values of ARs for carvedilol were as follows: alpha1D-AR (8.9)>alpha1B-AR (8.6)>beta1-AR (8.4)>beta2-AR (8.0)>alpha1A-AR (7.9)?alpha2C-AR (5.9)>alpha2B-AR (5.5)>alpha2A-AR (5.3). Furthermore, temporal kinetics of intracellular calcium signaling mediated via alpha1D- and alpha1B-ARs, but not via alpha1A-AR (P<0.01), showed oscillatory patterns with frequencies ranging from 0.3 to 3 per minute in human smooth muscle and HEK293 cells, which were inhibited by the therapeutic concentrations of carvedilol (10 nM) in a subtype-dependent manner. When oscillatory alpha1B-AR and non-oscillatory alpha1A-AR were co-expressed and heteromer receptors were detected with bioluminescence resonance energy transfer and co-immunoprecipitation, carvedilol suppressed only oscillatory component of global cytosolic free calcium change. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that in addition to beta-ARs, receptor inhibition by carvedilol is directed to alpha1-ARs, preferably to alpha1D- and alpha1B-AR-mediated signaling events, including intracellular calcium oscillations in vascular smooth muscle.
10480573	Effect of thiazinotrienomycin B, an ansamycin antibiotic, on the function of epidermal growth factor receptor in human stomach tumor cells.	Thiazinotrienomycin B (TT-B), an ansamycin isolated from fermentation broths of Streptomyces sp. MJ672-m3, inhibited the growth in vitro of human stomach tumor SC-6 cells over 10 times more strongly than the growth of other human tumor cells, such as HeLa (cervix), T24 (bladder) and LX-1 (lung). The extent of growth inhibition by TT-B of SC-6, but not of LX-1 nor T24, was lowered in a competitive manner by raising serum concentrations in the culture medium. TT-B inhibited the cell cycle progression of SC-6 at an early stage of the progression from G0/G1 to S. The inhibition was again competitive with serum concentrations in the culture medium. No direct inhibition of DNA synthesis was observed at the concentration range which caused the cell cycle arrest. TT-B and anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) were antagonistic to each other in inhibiting the cell cycle progression of SC-6 from G0/G1 to S, suggesting that the two compounds share the same target, EGFR. The kinase activity of EGFR was little inhibited by TT-B in a cell-free system.
15985434	Crystal structure of pyridoxal kinase in complex with roscovitine and derivatives.	Pyridoxal kinase (PDXK) catalyzes the phosphorylation of pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, and pyridoxine in the presence of ATP and Zn2+. This constitutes an essential step in the synthesis of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), the active form of vitamin B6, a cofactor for over 140 enzymes. (R)-Roscovitine (CYC202, Seliciclib) is a relatively selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), currently evaluated for the treatment of cancers, neurodegenerative disorders, renal diseases, and several viral infections. Affinity chromatography investigations have shown that (R)-roscovitine also interacts with PDXK. To understand this interaction, we determined the crystal structure of PDXK in complex with (R)-roscovitine, N6-methyl-(R)-roscovitine, and O6-(R)-roscovitine, the two latter derivatives being designed to bind to PDXK but not to CDKs. Structural analysis revealed that these three roscovitines bind similarly in the pyridoxal-binding site of PDXK rather than in the anticipated ATP-binding site. The pyridoxal pocket has thus an unexpected ability to accommodate molecules different from and larger than pyridoxal. This work provides detailed structural information on the interactions between PDXK and roscovitine and analogs. It could also aid in the design of roscovitine derivatives displaying strict selectivity for either PDXK or CDKs.
11489456	Evidence that hypophagia induced by d-fenfluramine and d-norfenfluramine in the rat is mediated by 5-HT2C receptors.	The present series of studies is the first to investigate the pharmacological mechanisms underlying d-fenfluramine- and d-norfenfluramine-induced hypophagia in the rat using highly selective serotonin 5-HT2 receptor antagonists. Administration of d-fenfluramine, and its major metabolite d-norfenfluramine, suppresses food intake in animals. Both compounds stimulate the release of serotonin and are potent inhibitors of the re-uptake of 5-HT into nerve terminals. In addition, d-norfenfluramine also acts as a direct 5-HT(2B/2C) receptor agonist. Pre-treatment with the selective 5-HT2C receptor antagonist, SB-242084 (0.3-3 mg/kg), dose-dependently inhibited both d-fenfluramine- (3 mg/kg) and d-norfenfluramine-induced (2 mg/kg) hypophagia. In contrast, the hypophagic effect of d-fenfluramine and d-norfenfluramine was unaffected by prior treatment with the highly selective 5-HT2B receptor antagonists, SB-215505 (0.3-3 mg/kg) and RS-127445 (1-3 mg/kg) or the 5-HT2A receptor antagonists MDL 100,907 (0.003-0.03 mg/kg) and ketanserin (0.2, 0.5 mg/kg). In addition, the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635 (0.3, 1 mg/kg) and the 5-HT1B receptor antagonists GR-127935 (1, 2 mg/kg) and SB-224289 (2-10 mg/kg) did not affect d-fenfluramine-induced hypophagia. These data provide unequivocal evidence for an important role of the 5-HT2C receptor in the mediation of d-fenfluramine and d-norfenfluramine-induced hypophagia in the rat and do not support the involvement of 5-HT1A/1B/2A/2B receptors.
16823043	Structure of the angiogenesis inhibitor ovalicin bound to its noncognate target, human Type 1 methionine aminopeptidase.	"Methionine aminopeptidases (MetAPs) remove the initiator methionine during protein biosynthesis. They exist in two isoforms, MetAP1 and MetAP2. The anti-angiogenic compound fumagillin binds tightly to the Type 2 MetAPs but only weakly to Type 1. High-affinity complexes of fumagillin and its relative ovalicin with Type 2 human MetAP have been reported. Here we describe the crystallographic structure of the low-affinity complex between ovalicin and Type 1 human MetAP at 1.1 A resolution. This provides the first opportunity to compare the structures of ovalicin or fumagillin bound to a Type 1 and a Type 2 MetAP. For both Type 1 and Type 2 human MetAPs the inhibitor makes a covalent adduct with a corresponding histidine. At the same time there are significant differences in the alignment of the inhibitors within the respective active sites. It has been argued that the lower affinity of ovalicin and fumagillin for the Type 1 MetAPs is due to the smaller size of their active sites relative to the Type 2 enzymes. Comparison with the uncomplexed structure of human Type 1 MetAP indicates that there is some truth to this. Several active site residues have to move ""outward"" by 0.5 Angstroms or so to accommodate the inhibitor. Other residues move ""inward."" There are, however, other factors that come into play. In particular, the side chain of His310 rotates by 134 degrees into a different position where (together with Glu128 and Tyr195) it coordinates a metal ion not seen at this site in the native enzyme."
23395667	Growth factor delivery from hydrogel particle aggregates to promote tubular regeneration after acute kidney injury.	Local delivery of growth factors (GFs) can accelerate regeneration of injured tissue, but for many medical applications, injectable GF delivery systems are required for clinical success. Viscoelastic, injectable aggregates of micrometer-sized hydrogel particles made of multiarmed polyethylene glycol (starPEG) and heparin were prepared and tested for site-specific paracrine stimulation of tissue regeneration. Heparin was used as it binds, protects and releases numerous GFs. Hydrogel based delivery of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and murine epidermal growth factor (EGF) was monitored utilizing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). bFGF was released slowly because of its high affinity to the heparin while the significantly higher release of the non-specific binding EGF was controlled by diffusion only. To investigate GF delivery in vivo, a hydrogel loaded with murine EGF or bFGF was injected subcapsularly into the left kidney of mice with experimental acute kidney injury caused by glycerol induced rhabdomyolysis. Visual examination confirmed sustained stability of the injected gel aggregates during the timescale of the experiment. The number of proliferating kidney tubular epithelial cells was quantified both in the injected kidney and the non-injected contralateral kidney. bFGF delivery from hydrogels induced a significant increase in cell proliferation in the injected kidney, although small effects were also seen in the non-injected kidney due to a systemic effect. EGF delivery strongly increased cell proliferation for both kidneys, but also showed a local effect on the injected kidney. The hydrogel without loaded GFs was used as a control and showed no increase in cell proliferation. Our results suggest that this novel starPEG-heparin hydrogel system can be an effective approach to deliver GFs locally.
23500387	Curcumin attenuates allergic airway inflammation by regulation of CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs)/Th17 balance in ovalbumin-sensitized mice.	The present study aimed to determine the protective effects and the underlying mechanisms of curcumin on ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic inflammation in a mouse model of allergic asthma. Asthma mice model was established by ovalbumin. A total of 60 mice were randomly assigned to six experimental groups: control, model, dexamethasone (2mg/kg), and curcumin (50mg/kg, 100mg/kg, 200mg/kg). Airway resistance (Raw) was measured by the forced oscillation technique, differential cell count in BAL fluid (BALF) was measured by Wright-Giemsa staining, histological assessment was measured by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, BALF levels of Treg/Th17 cytokines were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Treg cells and Th17 cells were evaluated by flow cytometry (FCM). Our study demonstrated that curcumin inhibited OVA-induced increases in eosinophil count; interleukin (IL)-17A level were recovered in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid increased IL-10 level in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Histological studies demonstrated that curcumin substantially inhibited OVA-induced eosinophilia in lung tissue. Flow cytometry (FCM) studies demonstrated that curcumin remarkably inhibited Th17 cells and significantly increased Treg cells. The results in vivo show ovalbumin-induced significantly broke Treg/Th17 balance; curcumin treatments markedly attenuated the inflammatory in asthma model by regulating Treg/Th17 balance. Our findings support the possible use of curcumin as a therapeutic drug for patients with allergic asthma.
12529935	Structure-function of the glucagon receptor family of G protein-coupled receptors: the glucagon, GIP, GLP-1, and GLP-2 receptors.	The glucagon-like peptides include glucagon, GLP-1, and GLP-2, and exert diverse actions on nutrient intake, gastrointestinal motility, islet hormone secretion, cell proliferation and apoptosis, nutrient absorption, and nutrient assimilation. GIP, a related member of the glucagon peptide superfamily, also regulates nutrient disposal via stimulation of insulin secretion. The actions of these peptides are mediated by distinct members of the glucagon receptor superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors. These receptors exhibit unique patterns of tissue-specific expression, exhibit considerable amino acid sequence identity, and share similar structural and functional properties with respect to ligand binding and signal transduction. This article provides an overview of the biology of these receptors with an emphasis on understanding the unique actions of glucagon-related peptides through studies of the biology of their cognate receptors.
11522647	Activated extracellular signal-regulated kinases: association with epidermal growth factor receptor/transforming growth factor alpha expression in head and neck squamous carcinoma and inhibition by anti-epidermal growth factor receptor treatments.	"The expression of the activated mitogen-activated kinases/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) ERK1 and ERK2 was characterized in 101 humanhead and neck squamous carcinoma specimens. Activated ERK1/2were detected at different levels in the majority of these tumors, as assayed by immunostaining with an antibody specific for the dually phosphorylated and activated ERK1 and ERK2. ERK1/2 activation levels were higher in tumors with advanced regional lymph node metastasis (P = 0.048) and in relapsed tumors (P = 0.021). The expression of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (P = 0.037), transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha; P < 0.001), and HER2 (P = 0.066; positive trend) correlated with activation of ERK1/2. In a multivariate analysis, both TGF-alpha (P < 0.0001) and HER2 (P = 0.045) were independently correlated with ERK1/2 activation. In turn, activation of ERK1/2 was associated with a higher Ki-67 proliferative index (P = 0.002). In EGF receptor-dependent model cells (A431 and DiFi), a specific EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (""Iressa""; ZD1839) and a chimeric anti-EGF receptor antibody (""Cetuximab""; C225) inhibited ERK 1/2 activation at concentrations that inhibited autocrine cell proliferation. In patients on treatment with C225, the activation of ERK1/2 in skin, an EGF receptor-dependent tissue, was lower compared with control skin. Parallel changes were seen in keratinocyte Ki67 proliferation indexes in skin from C225-treated patients. Taken together, these studies provide support for a role of activation of ERK1/2 in head and neck squamous carcinoma and a correlation with EGF receptor/TGF-alpha expression. The inhibition of ERK1/2 activation in vitro and in vivo by compounds targeting the EGF receptor points to the interest of ERK1/2 as potential surrogate markers of EGF-receptor signaling in clinical therapeutic studies."
2889803	Benzodiazepine receptor binding of triazolobenzodiazepines in vivo: increased receptor number with low-dose alprazolam.	Triazolobenzodiazepines are in clinical use as hypnotics and anxiolytics. We analyzed in vivo receptor binding and brain concentrations of alprazolam, triazolam, and estazolam. Drug concentrations measured in the cerebral cortex 1 h after administration were directly proportional to dose for all three compounds. In vivo receptor binding, as defined by the specific uptake of [3H]Ro15-1788, decreased with increasing doses of estazolam and triazolam, a finding indicating dose-related increases in receptor occupancy due to these compounds. Triazolam was substantially more potent, with an IC50 value of 16 ng/g, compared with 117 ng/g for estazolam. At higher doses of alprazolam (greater than 0.2 mg/kg), receptor binding by [3H]Ro15-1788, likewise decreased with increasing dose of the former drug. However, at lower doses of alprazolam (0.02-0.05 mg/kg), which resulted in cortex concentrations of 2-7 ng/g, receptor binding was increased above control values in cortex, hypothalamus, and hippocampus but not in several other brain regions. Binding returned to control values at doses of greater than or equal to 0.01 mg/kg. Similar results were obtained in time course studies. At 8 and 10 h after a dose of 1 mg/kg i.p., corresponding to cortex concentrations of 2.7-7 ng/g, receptor binding was increased compared with controls. Similarly, at 1, 2, and 3 h after a single dose of 0.05 mg/kg, corresponding to cortex concentrations of 3.7-5.8 ng/g, receptor binding was also increased. The apparent affinity of benzodiazepine receptors for clonazepam in mice receiving alprazolam (0.05 mg/kg) was unchanged from that in untreated control mice, an observation suggesting that low doses of alprazolam increased receptor number.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
1327384	[3H]-RS-15385-197, a selective and high affinity radioligand for alpha 2-adrenoceptors: implications for receptor classification.	1. RS-15385-197 is the most potent and selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist available. We have used [3H]-RS-15385-197 to define alpha 2-adrenoceptor subtypes. The binding of [3H]-RS-15385-197 to membranes of rat cerebral cortex, rat neonatal lung and human platelets was reversible, saturable and of high affinity. Saturation experiments indicated that [3H]-RS-15385-197 bound to a single population of sites in all 3 tissues with high affinity (0.08-0.14 nM). The density of sites labelled by [3H]-RS-15385-197 was greater in the cortex (275 fmol mg-1 protein) than in the neonate lung (174 fmol mg-1 protein) and human platelet (170 fmol mg-1 protein). The density of sites labelled with [3H]-RS-15385-197 in the cortex was significantly greater than that labelled with [3H]-yohimbine (121 fmol mg-1 protein). 2. The selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists, idazoxan, yohimbine, rauwolscine and WY 26703 displaced [3H]-RS-15385-197 binding to rat cerebral cortex in a simple manner with Hill slopes close to unity. The affinities derived for these antagonists against [3H]-RS-15385-197 were similar to the values obtained for the displacement of [3H]-yohimbine indicating the alpha 2-adrenoceptor nature of the binding site. 3. alpha 2A-Adrenoceptor selective compounds, oxymetazoline and BRL 44409, showed high affinity for [3H]-RS-15385-197 binding in the human platelet and lower affinity in the neonate lung, while the alpha 2B-selective compounds, prazosin and imiloxan, showed high affinity for [3H]-RS-15385-197 binding in the neonate lung.This suggests that [3H]-RS-15385-197 labels both alpha2A- and alpha2B-adrenoceptor subtypes.4. Prazosin and methysergide inhibited the binding of [3H]-RS-15385-197 in the rat cerebral cortex in a simple manner consistent with an interaction at a single site. Although oxymetazoline inhibited [H]-RS- 15385-197 with a Hill slope significantly different from unity, the slope was increased to unity in the presence of Gpp(NH)p, suggesting an agonist-like interaction.5. The site labelled by [3H]-RS-15385-197 in the rat cortex shows high affinity for oxymetazoline and low affinity for prazosin which could be taken as evidence for classifying the site as an alpha2A-subtype.However, the affinities of yohimbine, rauwolscine and oxymetazoline at this site do not correspond to the population of sites in the human platelet. Yohimbine and rauwolscine were 20 fold selective for the platelet alph2A-subtype, whereas phentolamine was 2 fold and imiloxan was 10 fold selective for the cortex subtype. Indeed although the site showed some similarities with the alpha2A-subtype, the highest degree of homology was observed between this site and the rat submaxillary gland and the RG20 clone,tentatively called the alpha2D-adrenoceptor subtype. We propose that the alpha2-adrenoceptor in the rat cortex may therefore correspond to the putative alpha2D-subtype of the adrenoceptor.
23206862	Identification of a novel benzimidazole derivative as a highly potent NPY Y5 receptor antagonist with an anti-obesity profile.	Optimization of HTS hit 1 for NPY Y5 receptor binding affinity, CYP450 inhibition, solubility and metabolic stability led to the identification of some orally available oxygen-linker derivatives for in vivo study. Among them, derivative 4i inhibited food intake induced by the NPY Y5 selective agonist, and chronic oral administration of 4i in DIO mice caused a dose-dependent reduction of body weight gain.
23123425	Dietary quercetin ameliorates nonalcoholic steatohepatitis induced by a high-fat diet in gerbils.	Dietary quercetin is highly abundant in edible plants, which possesses a wide range of pharmacological properties. This study was to investigate hepatoprotective effects of quercetin in the nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) gerbils induced by a high-fat diet (HFD), and to evaluate its regulatory mechanism on hepatic inflammatory response. The gerbils were fed with HFD for 28 days to induce NASH. From 15th day to 28th day, the treated drugs were given daily to each animal, respectively. The lipid profiles and biochemical markers were determined at the end of the experiment. The expressions of Sirt1, NF-κB p65 and iNOS were detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. The results showed that oral administration of quercetin at doses of 30-60 mg/kg to hyperlipidemia rats for 14 days were highly effective in decreasing the levels of serum total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). It could decrease lipid accumulation in the hepatocytes, and reduce serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 via regulating the expressions of Sirt1, NF-κB p65 and iNOS. Thus, dietary quercetin had significant therapeutic benefits and could be explored as a potential promising candidate for the prevention of NASH.
17133434	Hormones and body size evolution in papionin primates.	This study examines the evolution of size differences among papionin primates by measuring hormones that regulate size growth during ontogeny and influence ultimate adult size (insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), growth hormone binding protein (GHBP), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), testosterone, estradiol). The analyses assess longstanding ideas about circulating hormone levels and body size. Importantly, because the consensus papionin molecular phylogeny implies at least two episodes of size increase, this study offers opportunities to determine whether or not similar hormone profiles regulate this apparent evolutionary convergence (i.e., do larger-bodied papionins have higher levels of growth-related hormones than smaller-bodied papionins?). Five hundred and sixty serum samples (from 161 individuals) from 11 papionin species were analyzed using a two-level approach to address this issue. One used mixed longitudinal samples from two papionin species to test whether, during growth, large- and small-bodied species have higher and lower hormone levels, respectively. The second compared multiple papionin species to assess whether or not hormone levels covary with size in adult animals. Result show that size and hormone levels do not covary consistently across papionins, either during growth or in adulthood. Specifically, some smaller-bodied papionin species have higher absolute hormone levels than larger-bodied species. Differences in some hormone levels appear to track phylogeny more closely than body size. In contrast to studies based on single species, we demonstrate that, while the hormones analyzed affect growth, absolute circulating hormone levels either during growth or adulthood may be decoupled from interspecific differences in body size.
11120594	Cytokine production by naive and primary effector CD4+ T cells exposed to norepinephrine.	We recently showed that clones of Th1 cells, but not Th2 cells, expressed a functional beta-2-adrenergic receptor (beta2AR) and that either norepinephrine or the beta2AR agonist terbutaline stimulated this receptor to modulate the level of Th1 cytokines produced. In the present study, we show that norepinephrine and terbutaline stimulate the beta2AR to decrease the level of IL-2 produced by freshly isolated murine splenic naive CD4+ T cells from either Balb/C or DO11.10 transgenic mice and activated polyclonally with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAbs. In contrast, the level of cytokines produced by primary effector Th1 and Th2 cells were unaffected when norepinephrine, terbutaline, or cAMP analogs were added at the time of restimulation. These results suggest that a diversity exists among CD4+ T-cell subsets with respect to the level of adrenergic receptor expression, responsiveness to cAMP, stage of cell differentiation, or a combination of the above.
23333640	The inhibition of HIF-2α on the ATM/Chk-2 pathway is involved in the promotion effect of arsenite on benzo(a)pyrene-induced cell transformation.	Both arsenite and benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) are known human carcinogens. Studies on the mode-of-action of arsenite indicate that it can also act as co-carcinogen or as a cancer promoter, and that it can facilitate progression of cancers. Some studies on development of lung cancers have suggested a synergism between arsenite exposure and cigarette smoking. The mechanism of action for such an effect, however, remains obscure. In the present study, we investigated the effects of HIF-2α on arsenite- and BaP-induced cell malignant transformation as well as on signal transduction pathways in human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells. The results show that arsenite accelerates the neoplastic transformation and migration of cells and enhances chromosomal aberrations induced by BaP. HIF-2α is involved in blocking the effects of arsenite in activating the ATM/Chk-2 pathway and in repair of DNA damage induced by BaP. Moreover, blocking of HIF-2α prevents the effects of arsenite on the neoplastic transformation, cell migration, and chromosomal aberrations caused by BaP. These results indicate that the repressive effect of HIF-2α on the ATM/Chk-2 pathway leads to genomic instability, which is involved in arsenite-accelerated, BaP-induced malignant transformation of HBE cells.
23523101	Activation of PPARγ is required for hydroxysafflor yellow A of Carthamus tinctorius to attenuate hepatic fibrosis induced by oxidative stress.	Oxidative stress caused hepatic fibrosis by activating hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which were implemented by depressing PPARγ activation. Hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA) as a nature active ingredient with antioxidant capacity was able to effectively attenuate oxidative stress mediated injury. So it will be very interesting to study effect of HSYA on HSCs activation and liver fibrosis, and reveal the role of PPARγ·CCl4 and H2O2 were used to mimic oxidative stress mediated hepatic injury in vitro and in vivo respectively. The anti-fibrosis effects of HSYA were evaluated and its mechanisms were disclosed by applying western blot, histopathological analysis, flow cytometry, RT-PCR and ELISA. Our results showed that HSCs activation and proliferation could be induced by oxidative stress, and the expressive levels of TGF-β1 and TIMP-1, the serum levels of ALT, AST, HA, LN, III-C and IV-C were also enhanced by oxidative stress, which is correlated with liver fibrosis (p<0.05 or p<0.01). HSYA was able to effectively inhibit oxidative stress mediated hepatic injury by increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes, up regulating the expression of PPARγ and MMP-2, and down regulating the expression of TGF-β1 and TIMP-1, and reducing α-SMA level. The protective effect of HSYA can be significantly attenuated by GW9662 via blocking PPARγ (p<0.05 or p<0.01). Taken together, these results demonstrate that HSYA is able to significantly protect the liver from oxidative stress, which requires for HSYA to stimulate PPARγ activity, reduce cell proliferation and suppress ECM synthesis.
12200198	Neuroprotection by propargylamines in Parkinson's disease: suppression of apoptosis and induction of prosurvival genes.	In Parkinson's disease (PD), therapies to delay or suppress the progression of cell death in nigrostriatal dopamine neurons have been proposed by use of various agents. An inhibitor of type B monoamine oxidase (MAO-B), (-)deprenyl (selegiline), was reported to have neuroprotective activity, but clinical trials failed to confirm it. However, the animal and cellular models of PD proved that selegiline protects neurons from cell death. Among selegiline-related propargylamines, (R)(+)-N-propargyl-1-aminoindan (rasagiline) was the most effective to suppress the cell death in in vivo and in vitro experiments. In this paper, the mechanism of the neuroprotection by rasagiline was examined using human dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells against cell death induced by an endogenous dopaminergic neurotoxin N-methyl(R)salsolinol (NM(R)Sal). NM(R)Sal induced apoptosis (but not necrosis) in SH-SY5Y cells, and the apoptotic cascade was initiated by mitochondrial permeability transition (PT) and activated by stepwise reactions. Rasagiline prevented the PT in mitochondria directly and also indirectly through induction of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and a neurotrophic factor, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). Long-term administration of propargylamines to rats increased the activities of antioxidative enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase in the brain regions containing dopamine neurons. Rasagiline and related propargylamines may rescue degenerating dopamine neurons through inhibiting death signal transduction initiated by mitochondria PT.
12970106	Agonist actions of dihydroergotamine at 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors and their possible relevance to antimigraine efficacy.	1. The pharmaceutical compound, dihydroergotamine (DHE) is dispensed to prevent and reduce the occurrence of migraine attacks. Although still controversial, the prophylactic effect of this drug is believed to be caused through blockade and/or activation of numerous receptors including serotonin (5-HT) receptors of the 5-HT2 subtype. 2. To elucidate if 5-HT2 receptors (5-HT2Rs) may be involved in DHE prophylactic effect, we performed investigations aimed to determine the respective pharmacological profile of DHE and of its major metabolite 8'-hydroxy-DHE (8'-OH-DHE) at the 5-HT2B and 5-HT2CRs by binding, inositol triphosphate (IP3) or cyclic GMP (cGMP) coupling studies in transfected fibroblasts. 3. DHE and 8'-OH-DHE are competitive compounds at 5-HT2B and 5-HT2CRs. 8'-OH-DHE interaction at (5-HT2BRs) was best fitted by a biphasic competition curve and displayed the highest affinity with a Ki of 5 nm. These two compounds acted as agonists for both receptors in respect to cGMP production with pEC50 of 8.32+/-0.09 for 8'-OH-DHE at 5-HT2B and 7.83+/-0.06 at 5-HT2CRs. 4. Knowing that the antimigraine prophylactic effect of DHE is only observed after long-term treatment, we chronically exposed the recombinant cells to DHE and 8'-OH-DHE. The number of 5-HT2BR-binding sites was always more affected than 5-HT2CRs. At 5-HT2BRs, 8'-OH-DHE was more effective than DHE, with an uncoupling that persisted for more than 40 h for IP3 or cGMP. By contrast, the 5-HT2CR coupling was reversible after either treatment. 5. Chronic exposure to 8'-OH-DHE caused a persistent agonist-mediated desensitisation of 5-HT2B, but not 5-HT2CRs. This may be of relevance to therapeutic actions of the compound.
19620795	[Mammalian target of rapamycin, its mode of action and clinical response in metastatic clear cell carcinoma].	The mammalian target of rapamycin(mTOR)and its molecular pathways are supposed to be activated frequently in human renal cell carcinoma as well as other cancers. It has a kinase activity for 40S ribosomal protein kinase and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1. These proteins, when phosphorylated, promote protein translation and RNA transcription in the nutrient-rich condition. mTOR inhibitors such as Temsirolimus (CCI779) and Everolimus (RAD001) are effective for suppressing cell growth with inhibiting mTOR kinase activity. Rapamycin and its related analogs such as Temsirolimus and Everolimus are less toxic for humans compared with other anti-VEGFR inhibitors and has been used as an immunosuppressive agent. These agents have an inhibitory activity against the mTORC1 complex. Since they do not have inhibitory activity against mTORC2 complex, the ability of mTOR inhibition by Temsirolimus is supposed to be 40 to 50% of full inhibition in mTOR kinase. Temsirolimus has modest anticancer activity against advanced clinical RCC patients with poor risk. The objective response rate was only 7%, 26% of patients experienced minor responses and another 17% of patients had stable disease that lasted 6 months. The median time to tumor progression and median survival for the study patients were 5.8 and 15.0 months, respectively. The overall survival of patients treated with Temsirolimus alone was statistically longer than in those treated with IFN alone in the 626 cases in phase II study. Combinations of mTOR with other anti- VEGFR agents were not effective. Vertical therapies of mTOR inhibitor in combination with AKT inhibitors, or newly development of stronger mTOR kinase which can suppress both mTORC1 and mTORC2 are planned at present.
23474014	Time-dependent effects of corticosterone on reward-based decision-making in a rodent model of the Iowa Gambling Task.	Corticosteroid hormones, released after stress, are known to change neuronal activity in two time-domains: within minutes via non-genomic pathways and with a delay of >1 h through pathways involving transcriptional regulation. Recent evidence in rodents and humans indicates that these two modes of corticosteroid action differently affect cognitive tasks. Here, we investigated whether reward-based decision-making, in a rat model of the Iowa Gambling Task (rIGT), is also differently altered by rapid versus delayed actions of corticosterone. We targeted the rapid and delayed time domain by injecting corticosterone (CORT, 1 mg/kg, s.c.) at 30 min (rapid) or 180 min (delayed) respectively prior to behavioural testing, during the final 3 days of the behavioural paradigm. In saline treated rats, the number of visits to the disadvantageous arm decreased over trial blocks, whilst this was attenuated when CORT was administered 30 min before testing. This attenuation was associated with a significantly increased c-Fos expression in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and insular cortex, and a trend for an increase in the infralimbic cortex. The rapid corticosteroid effect contrasted with treatment 180 min before testing, where the number of visits to the disadvantageous arm as well as c-Fos labelling was not affected. These findings indicate that rapid corticosteroid actions impair reward-based decision-making.
2450203	Benzodiazepines, but not beta carbolines, limit high frequency repetitive firing of action potentials of spinal cord neurons in cell culture.	Effects of benzodiazepines (BDZs) and beta carbolines (beta CCs) on sustained repetitive firing at high frequency (SRF) of action potentials of mouse spinal cord neurons in cell culture were examined using intracellular recording techniques. In control medium neurons responded to depolarizing current pulses with SRF. Limitation of SRF was produced by the anticonvulsant BDZs (diazepam, clonazepam, nitrazepam and lorazepam) at low to mid nanomolar concentrations, by a convulsant BDZ which does not bind to high affinity BDZ receptors (Ro 5-4864) at high nanomolar concentrations and by a BDZ receptor weak partial agonist (Ro 15-1788) at micromolar concentrations. The limitation of SRF was accompanied by use- and voltage-dependent reduction of maximal rate of rise (Vmax) of sodium-dependent action potentials. Partial agonist and inverse agonist beta CCs did not limit SRF at concentrations up to 200 nM. The limitation of SRF by diazepam was not prevented by inverse or partial agonists at the BDZ receptor, including Ro 15-1788 and the beta CCs. These findings suggest that limitation of SRF was produced by binding of BDZs, but not beta CCs, to voltage-dependent sodium channels and not to high affinity central BDZ receptors, and that BDZs limit SRF by slowing recovery of sodium channels from inactivation. We propose that the limitation of SRF may contribute to the efficacy of BDZs against generalized tonic-clonic seizures and status epilepticus.
23437843	Discovery, biological evaluation, and structure-activity and -selectivity relationships of 6'-substituted (E)-2-(benzofuran-3(2H)-ylidene)-N-methylacetamides, a novel class of potent and selective monoamine oxidase inhibitors.	The use of selective inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) and B (MAO-B) holds a therapeutic relevance in the treatment of depressive disorders and Parkinson's disease (PD), respectively. Here, the discovery of a new class of compounds acting as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO-Is) and bearing a 6'-substituted (E)-2-(benzofuran-3(2H)-ylidene)-N-alkylacetamide skeleton is reported. 6'-Sulfonyloxy derivatives exhibited outstanding affinities to MAO-A (7.0 nM < IC50 < 49 nM, much higher than moclobemide) and a pronounced MAO-A/B selectivity. The corresponding 6'-benzyloxy derivatives showed potent MAO-B inhibition and inverted selectivity profile. The rigid E-geometry of the exocyclic double bond allowed a more efficient binding conformation compared to more flexible and less active 2-(1-benzofuran-3-yl)-N-methylacetamide isomers and 4-N-methylcarboxamidomethylcoumarin analogues. Focused structural modifications and docking simulations enabled the identification of key molecular determinants for high affinity toward both MAO isoforms. These novel MAO-Is may represent promising hits for the development of safer therapeutic agents with a potential against depression, PD, and other age-related neurodegenerative pathologies.
23287710	Dose dependent molecular effects of acrylamide and glycidamide in human cancer cell lines and human primary hepatocytes.	Recently published studies suggest a weak positive correlation between increased dietary acrylamide intake and the increased risk of endometrial and ovarian cancer. However, risk assessment of acrylamide remains difficult because the carcinogenic mechanisms are still unknown and in particular the molecular effects of low level acrylamide exposure as seen by dietary intake are not well understood. Therefore, we analyzed in ovarian and endometrial cancer cell lines as well as in primary hepatocytes the expression of genes involved in cancer development and xenobiotic metabolism after high and low dose exposure (1-0.001mM) of acrylamide and its metabolite glycidamide. In conclusion our in vitro results demonstrate that exposure to high doses of glycidamide/acrylamide - exceeding the dietary exposure of the general population by far - can induce genes with growth promoting potential like the oncogene cMYC and genes involved in the MAPK pathway. However, low-dose exposure seems to activate primarily genes involved in the elimination of the toxicant.
17471183	Tricyclic antidepressant pharmacology and therapeutic drug interactions updated.	New data on the pharmacology of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), their affinities for human cloned CNS receptors and their cytochrome P450 enzyme inhibition profiles, allow improved deductions concerning their effects and interactions and indicate which of the TCAs are the most useful. The relative toxicity of TCAs continues to be more precisely defined, as do TCA interactions with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). TCA interactions with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) have been, historically, an uncertain and difficult question, but are now well understood, although this is not reflected in the literature. The data indicate that nortriptyline and desipramine have the most pharmacologically desirable characteristics as noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (NRIs), and as drugs with few interactions that are also safe when coadministered with either MAOIs or SSRIs. Clomipramine is the only available antidepressant drug that has good evidence of clinically relevant serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibition (SNRI). These data assist drug selection for monotherapy and combination therapy and predict reliably how and why pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions occur. In comparison, two newer drugs proposed to have SNRI properties, duloxetine and venlafaxine, may have insufficient NRI potency to be effective SNRIs. Combinations such as sertraline and nortriptyline may therefore offer advantages over drugs like venlafaxine that have fixed ratios of SRI/NRI effects that are not ideal. However, no TCA/SSRI combination is sufficiently safe to be universally applicable without expert knowledge. Standard texts (e.g. the British National Formulary) and treatment guidelines would benefit by taking account of these new data and understandings.
22790794	Novel electrophysiological properties of dronedarone: inhibition of human cardiac two-pore-domain potassium (K2P) channels.	Dronedarone is currently used for the treatment of paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation (AF). Pharmacological inhibition of cardiac two-pore-domain potassium (K(2P)) channels results in action potential prolongation and has recently been proposed as novel antiarrhythmic strategy. We hypothesized that blockade of human K(2P) channels contributes to the electrophysiological efficacy of dronedarone in AF. Two-electrode voltage clamp and whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology was used to record K(2P) currents from Xenopus oocytes and Chinese hamster ovary cells. All functional human K(2P) channels were screened for dronedarone sensitivity, revealing significant and concentration-dependent inhibition of cardiac K(2P)2.1 (TREK1; IC(50) = 26.7 muM) and K(2P)3.1 channels (TASK1; IC(50) = 18.7 muM) with maximum current reduction of 60.3 and 65.5 % in oocytes. IC(50) values obtained from mammalian cells yielded 6.1 muM (K(2P)2.1) and 5.2 muM (K(2P)3.1). The molecular mechanism of action was studied in detail. Dronedarone block affected open and closed channels. K(2P)3.1 currents were reduced in frequency-dependent fashion in contrast to K(2P)2.1. Mutagenesis studies revealed that amino acid residues implicated in K(2P)3.1 drug interactions were not required for dronedarone blockade. The class III antiarrhythmic drug dronedarone targets multiple human cardiac two-pore-domain potassium channels, including atrial-selective K(2P)3.1 currents. K(2P) current inhibition by dronedarone represents a previously unrecognized mechanism of action that extends the multichannel blocking profile of the drug.
23471540	Global analysis of Drosophila Cys2-His2 zinc finger proteins reveals a multitude of novel recognition motifs and binding determinants.	Cys2-His2 zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) are the largest group of transcription factors in higher metazoans. A complete characterization of these ZFPs and their associated target sequences is pivotal to fully annotate transcriptional regulatory networks in metazoan genomes. As a first step in this process, we have characterized the DNA-binding specificities of 129 zinc finger sets from Drosophila using a bacterial one-hybrid system. This data set contains the DNA-binding specificities for at least one encoded ZFP from 70 unique genes and 23 alternate splice isoforms representing the largest set of characterized ZFPs from any organism described to date. These recognition motifs can be used to predict genomic binding sites for these factors within the fruit fly genome. Subsets of fingers from these ZFPs were characterized to define their orientation and register on their recognition sequences, thereby allowing us to define the recognition diversity within this finger set. We find that the characterized fingers can specify 47 of the 64 possible DNA triplets. To confirm the utility of our finger recognition models, we employed subsets of Drosophila fingers in combination with an existing archive of artificial zinc finger modules to create ZFPs with novel DNA-binding specificity. These hybrids of natural and artificial fingers can be used to create functional zinc finger nucleases for editing vertebrate genomes.
9572299	Modulation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor by haloperidol: NR2B-specific interactions.	The dopaminergic antagonist haloperidol has an eight- to 10-fold higher affinity for NMDA receptors containing the NR2B (epsilon2) subunit, showing the same subunit specificity as ifenprodil, polyamines, and magnesium. In the present study, we have compared the effects of mutations altering polyamine and ifenprodil sensitivity on haloperidol sensitivity of NMDA receptors. As seen for spermidine stimulation, high-affinity haloperidol inhibition is governed by the region around amino acid 198, based on results from chimeric murine NR2A/NR2B (epislon1/epsilon2) receptors. Mutation of epsilon2E201 in this region to asparagine or arginine causes a 10-fold decrease in the ability of haloperidol to inhibit 125I-MK-801 binding. Epsilon2E201 does not govern the interactions of ifenprodil, because all of the mutants at epsilon2E201 exhibited wild-type affinity for ifenprodil. Mutation of epsilon2R337 causes a 400-fold loss in apparent affinity for ifenprodil but does not change the effects of haloperidol. The structural determinants of spermidine stimulation do not perfectly match those for haloperidol inhibition, as mutations of E200 remove haloperidol inhibition but do not alter polyamine stimulation. The present results thus demonstrate that although spermidine, haloperidol, and ifenprodil share subunit selectivity and overlapping pharmacology, they also have specific structural determinants.
10494488	Variations of progesterone receptor and c-fos gene expression in the rat uterus after treatment with norethisterone and its A-ring reduced metabolites.	It has been suggested that some contraceptive derivatives of 19-nor-testosterone possess estrogenic activity that may facilitate the development of breast cancer. The aim of this work was to investigate the estrogenic properties of norethisterone (NET) and its A-ring-reduced derivatives by determining progesterone receptor (PR) and c-fos mRNA content of two estrogen-regulated genes in the uterus of ovariectomized rats. mRNA content was evaluated by Northern blot 1-6 h after 17 beta-estradiol administration. The highest PR and c-fos mRNA content was observed 3 h and 2 h after 17 beta-estradiol administration, respectively. NET did not modify either PR or c-fos mRNA content. In contrast, 5 alpha- and 3 beta, 5 alpha-NET significantly increased mRNA content of both genes. The increase in c-fos mRNA content induced by these reduced compounds was lower than that found with estradiol treatment. The overall results indicate that NET administration can indirectly induce estrogenic effects through the action of its 5 alpha-dihydro and 3 beta, 5 alpha-tetrahydro derivatives.
23535185	Galangin attenuates mast cell-mediated allergic inflammation.	A great number of people are suffering from allergic inflammatory disease such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, and sinusitis. Therefore discovery of drugs for the treatment of these diseases is an important subject in human health. In this study, we investigated anti-allergic inflammatory effect of galangin and underlying mechanisms of action using in vitro and in vivo models. Galangin inhibited histamine release by the reduction of intracellular calcium in phorbol 12-mystate 13-acetate plus calcium ionophore A23187-stimulated human mast cells (HMC-1). Galangin decreased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and IL-8. The inhibitory effect of galangin on theses pro-inflammatory cytokines was related with c-Jun N-terminal kinases, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, nuclear factor-κB, and caspase-1. Furthermore, galangin attenuated IgE-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis and the expression of histamine receptor 1 at the inflamed tissue. The inhibitory effects of galangin were more potent than cromolyn, a known anti-allergic drug. Our results showed that galangin down-regulates mast cell-derived allergic inflammatory reactions by blocking histamine release and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In light of in vitro and in vivo anti-allergic inflammatory effects, galangin could be a beneficial anti-allergic inflammatory agent.
22977167	Effects of ozone and particulate matter on cardiac mechanics: role of the atrial natriuretic peptide gene.	A positive association between air pollution exposure and increased human risk of chronic heart disease progression is well established. In the current study, we test two hypotheses: (1) the cardiac compensatory changes in response to air pollution are dependent on its composition and (2) specific cardiac adaptations are regulated by atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). We address these hypotheses by initially examining the exposure effects of ozone (O(3)) and/or particulate matter (PM) on cardiac function in C57Bl/6J (B6) mice. Subsequently, the results are compared with cardiac functional changes to the same exposures in Nppa (the precursor gene for ANP) knockout (KO) mice. Separate groups of mice underwent 3 consecutive days of the same exposure sequence for 3h each consisting of the following: (1) 6h of filtered air (FAFA), (2) O(3) then FA (O(3)FA), (3) FA then carbon black (FACB), or (4) O(3) then CB. Cardiac function was assessed using a conductance catheter to generate cardiac pressure-volume loops 8-10h following each exposure sequence. As compared with FAFA, each sequence led to a substantial drop (as much as 33%) in stroke volume and cardiac output. However, these losses of cardiac function occurred by different compensatory mechanisms dependent on the pollutant composition. For example, O(3)FA exposure led to reductions in both end-systolic and end-diastolic left ventricular (LV) volumes, whereas FACB exposure led an increase in end-diastolic LV volume. These same cardiac compensatory changes were largely abolished in Nppa KO mice following O(3)FA or FACB exposure. These results suggest that cardiac functional changes in response to air pollution exposure are strongly dependent on the pollutant constituents, especially related to O(3) and/or PM. Furthermore, ANP regulation appears to be crucial to these cardiac compensatory mechanisms induced by air pollution.
20222714	Complexity in influenza virus targeted drug design: interaction with human sialidases.	With the global spread of the pandemic H1N1 and the ongoing pandemic potential of the H5N1 subtype, the influenza virus represents one of the most alarming viruses spreading worldwide. The influenza virus sialidase is an effective drug target, and a number of inhibitors are clinically effective against the virus (zanamivir, oseltamivir, peramivir). Here we report structural and biochemical studies of the human cytosolic sialidase Neu2 with influenza virus sialidase-targeting drugs and related compounds.
23333576	Areca nut procyanidins ameliorate streptozocin-induced hyperglycemia by regulating gluconeogenesis.	Hepatic gluconeogenesis is a major contributor to blood glucose in diabetes mellitus. Our previous study indicated that areca nut extract enriched with catechin-based procyanidins from oligomers to polymers gave rise to anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo. Here we have surveyed the molecular features of areca nut procyanidins (ANPs) using quadrupole time-of-flight liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (Q-TOF LC/MS) and the resulting mass spectrum accurately described ANP from monomer to hexadecamer. Furthermore, the potential of ANP in terms of blood glucose homeostasis was explored using cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/dexamethasone stimulated primary mouse hepatocytes and multiple low dose streptozocin (MLD-STZ) treated mice. With the primary hepatocytes, ANP dose-dependently inhibited gluconeogenesis and reduced the mRNA expression of two gluconeogenic key enzymes, phosphoenol-pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase). Intragastrically feeding of 10mg/kg ANP for 4weeks reduced the levels of fasting blood glucose, PEPCK and G6Pase in MLD-STZ mice. In additional, the level of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) expression showed a trend towards being restored in the ANP treated MLD-STZ-mice. This study indicated that ANP has the potential to improve hyperglycemia by regulating gluconeogenic related kinases in MLD-STZ-mice.
23071294	ApoE derived from adipose tissue does not suppress atherosclerosis or correct hyperlipidemia in apoE knockout mice.	The synthesis of apoE by adipocytes has profound effects on adipose tissue lipid flux and gene expression. Using adipose tissue transplantation from wild-type (WT) to apoE knockout (EKO) mice, we show that adipose tissue also contributes to circulating apoE. Different from circulating apoE produced by bone marrow transplantation (BMT), however, adipose tissue-derived apoE does not correct hyperlipidemia or suppress atherosclerosis. ApoE secreted by macrophages has a more acidic isoform distribution, and it increases binding of reconstituted VLDL particles to hepatocytes and fibroblasts more effectively than apoE secreted by adipocytes. The incremental binding can be entirely accounted for by binding to the LDL receptor. After BMT into EKO hosts, plasma cholesterol and macrophage-derived apoE are largely within IDL/LDL- and HDL-sized particles. After adipose tissue transplantation, most cholesterol and adipocyte apoE remain in VLDL. After BMT, circulating apoE no longer demonstrates predominance of acidic isoforms compared with that circulating after fat transplantation. In conclusion, fat transplantation provides circulating apoE levels similar to those provided by bone marrow transplantation, but it does not suppress hyperlipidemia or atherosclerosis. A potential mechanism contributing to this difference is differential binding to cell surface lipoprotein receptors.
22935610	The prolyl-isomerase Pin1 activates the mitochondrial death program of p53.	In response to intense stress, the tumor protein p53 (p53) tumor suppressor rapidly mounts a direct mitochondrial death program that precedes transcription-mediated apoptosis. By eliminating severely damaged cells, this pathway contributes to tumor suppression as well as to cancer cell killing induced by both genotoxic drugs and non-genotoxic p53-reactivating molecules. Here we have explored the role had in this pathway by the prolyl-isomerase Pin1 (peptidylprolyl cis/trans isomerase, NIMA-interacting 1), a crucial transducer of p53's phosphorylation into conformational changes unleashing its pro-apoptotic activity. We show that Pin1 promotes stress-induced localization of p53 to mitochondria both in vitro and in vivo. In particular, we demonstrate that upon stress-induced phosphorylation of p53 on Ser46 by homeodomain interacting protein kinase 2, Pin1 stimulates its mitochondrial trafficking signal, that is, monoubiquitination. This pathway is induced also by the p53-activating molecule RITA, and we demonstrate the strong requirement of Pin1 for the induction of mitochondrial apoptosis by this compound. These findings have significant implications for treatment of p53-expressing tumors and for prospective use of p53-activating compounds in clinics.
23132743	Ligand-dependent actions of the vitamin D receptor are required for activation of TGF-β signaling during the inflammatory response to cutaneous injury.	The vitamin D receptor (VDR) has both 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-dependent and -independent actions in the epidermis. Ligand-dependent actions of the VDR have been shown to promote keratinocyte differentiation and to regulate formation of the epidermal barrier. In contrast, the actions of the VDR that regulate postmorphogenic hair cycling do not require 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. The VDR also has immunomodulatory actions that are dependent on its ligand, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. To determine whether the ligand-dependent or -independent actions of the VDR regulate the inflammatory response to cutaneous injury, studies were performed in control, VDR knockout, and vitamin D-deficient mice. These investigations demonstrate that absence of receptor or ligand impairs the dermal response to cutaneous injury. Although neutrophil recruitment is not affected, the absence of VDR signaling leads to defects in macrophage recruitment and granulation tissue formation. Studies performed to identify the molecular basis for this phenotype demonstrate that absence of the VDR, or its ligand, impairs TGF-β signaling in the dermis, characterized by decreased expression of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and reduced phosphorylation of phosphorylated Smad-3 as well as attenuated phosphorylated Smad-3 phosphorylation in response to TGF-β in primary dermal fibroblasts lacking the VDR. Thus, these data demonstrate that the liganded VDR interacts with the TGF-β signaling pathway to promote the normal inflammatory response to cutaneous injury.
6706930	Mechanism of iodide-dependent catalatic activity of thyroid peroxidase and lactoperoxidase.	Mechanisms that have been proposed for peroxidase-catalyzed iodination require the utilization of 1 mol of H2O2 for organic binding of 1 mol of iodide. When we measured the stoichiometry of this reaction using thyroid peroxidase or lactoperoxidase at pH 7.0, we consistently obtained a ratio less than 1.0. This was shown to be attributable to catalase-like activity of these enzymes, resulting in unproductive cleavage of H2O2. This catalatic activity was completely iodide-dependent. To elucidate the mechanism of the iodide-dependent catalatic activity, the effects of various agents were investigated. The major observations may be summarized as follows: 1) The catalatic activity was inhibited in the presence of an iodine acceptor such as tyrosine. 2) The pseudohalide, SCN-, could not replace I- as a promoter of catalatic activity. 3) The inhibitory effects of the thioureylene drugs, methimazole and carbimazole, on the iodide-dependent catalatic activity were very similar to those reported previously for thyroid peroxidase-catalyzed iodination. 4) High concentrations of I- inhibited the catalatic activity of thyroid peroxidase and lactoperoxidase in a manner similar to that described previously for peroxidase-catalyzed iodination. On the basis of these observations and other findings, we have proposed a scheme which offers a possible explanation for iodide-dependent catalatic activity of thyroid peroxidase and lactoperoxidase. Compound I of the peroxidases is represented as EO, and oxidation of I- by EO is postulated to form enzyme-bound hypoiodite, represented in our scheme as [EOI]-. We suggest that the latter can react with H2O2 in a catalase-like reaction, with evolution of O2. We postulate further that the same form of oxidized iodine is also involved in iodination of tyrosine, oxidation of thioureylene drugs, and oxidation of I-, and that inhibition of catalatic activity by these agents occurs through competition with H2O2 for oxidized iodine.
23265880	A new single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging agent for serotonin transporters: [(125)I]Flip-IDAM, (2-((2-((dimethylamino)methyl)-4-iodophenyl)thio)phenyl)methanol.	New ligands for in vivo brain imaging of serotonin transporter (SERT) with single photon emission tomography (SPECT) were prepared and evaluated. An efficient synthesis and radiolabeling of a biphenylthiol, FLIP-IDAM, 4, was accomplished. The affinity of FLIP-IDAM was evaluated by an in vitro inhibitory binding assay using [(125)I]-IDAM as radioligand in rat brain tissue homogenates (K(i) = 0.03 nM). New [(125)I]Flip-IDAM exhibited excellent binding affinity to SERT binding sites with a high hypothalamus to cerebellum ratio of 4 at 30 min post iv injection. The faster in vivo kinetics for brain uptake and a rapid washout from non-specific regions provide excellent signal to noise ratio. This new agent, when labeled with (123)I, may be a useful imaging agent for mapping SERT binding sites in the human brain.
17434872	Molecular determinants for the selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 by lumiracoxib.	Lumiracoxib is the first example of a marketed COX-2 inhibitor of the arylacetic acid class, and it is reported to be the most selective COXIB in vivo. However, the molecular basis of its COX-2 inhibition has not been completely defined. Using standard assays, lumiracoxib was found to be a poor inhibitor of purified ovine COX-1 and a relatively weak inhibitor of purified human COX-2. The extent of COX-2 inhibition plateaued at around 50% and suggested that the inhibitor may be reversibly bound to the enzyme. Kinetic studies with lumiracoxib demonstrated that it was a time-dependent and slowly reversible inhibitor of human COX-2 that exhibited at least two binding steps during inhibition. Derivatives of lumiracoxib were synthesized with or without the methyl group on the phenylacetic acid ring and with various substitutions on the lower aniline ring. Inhibition studies demonstrated that the methyl group on the phenylacetic acid ring is required for COX-2 selectivity. The chemical identity and position of the substituents on the lower aniline ring were important in determining the potency and extent of COX inhibition as well as COX-2 selectivity. Mutation of Ser-530 to Ala or Val-349 to Ala or Leu abolished the potent inhibition observed with wild-type human COX-2 and key lumiracoxib analogs. Interestingly, a Val-349 to Ile mutant was inhibited with equal potency to human COX-2 with 2,6-dichloro-, 2,6-dimethyl-, or 2-chloro-6-methyl-substituted inhibitors and, in the case of lumiracoxib, actually showed an increase in potency. Taken together with a recent crystal structure of a lumiracoxib-COX-2 complex, the kinetic analyses presented herein of the inhibition of mutant COX-2s by lumiracoxib allows the definition of the molecular basis of COX-2 inhibition.
23602989	Presynaptic CaMKIIα modulates dopamine D3 receptor activation in striatonigral terminals of the rat brain in a Ca(2+) dependent manner.	CaMKIIα is expressed at high density in the nucleus accumbens where it binds to postsynaptic D3 receptors inhibiting their effects. In striatonigral projections, activation of presynaptic D3 receptors potentiates D1 receptor-induced stimulation of cAMP production and GABA release. In this study we examined whether the presynaptic effects of D3 receptor stimulation in the substantia nigra reticulata (SNr) are modulated by Ca(2+) activation of CaMKIIα. In SNr synaptosomes two procedures that increase cytoplasmic Ca(2+), ionomycin and K(+)-depolarization, blocked the additional stimulation of cAMP accumulation produced by coactivating D3 and D1 dopamine receptors. The selective CaMKIIα inhibitor KN-62 reversed the blockade produced by ionomycin and K(+)-depolarization. Incubation in either Ca(2) -free solutions or with the selective Ca(2+) blocker nifedipine, also reversed the blocking effects of K(+)-depolarization. Immunoblot studies showed that K(+)-depolarization increased CaMKIIα phosphorylation in a KN-62 sensitive manner and promoted CaMKIIα binding to D3 receptors. In K(+)-depolarized tissues, D3 receptors potentiated D1 receptor-induced stimulation of [(3)H]GABA release only when CaMKIIα was blocked with KN-62. In the presence of this inhibitor, the selective D3 agonist PD 128,907 reduced the ED50 for the D1 agonist SKF 38393 from 56 to 4 nM. KN-62 also enhanced the effects of dopamine on depolarization induced [(3)H]GABA release. KN-62 changed ED50 for dopamine from 584 to 56 nM. KN-62 did not affect D1 and D4 receptor responses. These experiments show that in striatonigral projections, CaMKIIα inhibits the action of D3 receptors in a Ca(2+) dependent manner blocking their modulatory effects on GABA release. These findings suggest a mechanism through which the frequency of action potential discharge in presynaptic terminals regulates dopamine effects.
9079657	Activation-dependent exposure of the inter-EGF sequence Leu83-Leu88 in factor Xa mediates ligand binding to effector cell protease receptor-1.	Binding of factor Xa to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) is contributed by effector cell protease receptor-1 (EPR-1). The structural requirements of this recognition were investigated. Factor Xa or catalytically inactive 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1sulfonyl (dansyl) Glu-Gly-Arg-(DEGR)-chloromethylketone-factor Xa bound indistinguishably to HUVEC and EPR-1 transfectants, and inhibited equally well the binding of 125I-factor Xa to these cells. Similarly, factor Xa active site inhibitors TAP or NAP5 did not reduce ligand binding to EPR-1. A factor X peptide duplicating the inter-EGF sequence Leu83-Phe84-Thr85-Arg86-Lys87-Leu88- (Gly) inhibited factor V/Va-independent prothrombin activation by HUVEC and blocked binding of 125I-factor Xa to these cells in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 approximately 20-40 microM). In contrast, none of the other factor X peptides tested or a control peptide with the inter-EGF sequence in scrambled order was effective. A recombinant chimeric molecule expressing the factor X sequence Leu83-Leu88 within a factor IX backbone inhibited binding of 125I-factor Xa to HUVEC and EPR-1 transfectants in a dose-dependent fashion, while recombinant factor IX or plasma IXa had no effect. An antibody generated against the factor X peptide 83-88, and designated JC15, inhibited 125I-factor Xa binding to HUVEC. The JC15 antibody bound to factor Xa and the recombinant IX/X83-88 chimera in a concentration dependent manner, while no specific reactivity with factors X or IXa was observed. Furthermore, binding of 125I-factor Xa to immobilized JC15 was inhibited by molar excess of unlabeled factor Xa, but not by comparable concentrations of factors X or IXa. These findings identify the inter-EGF sequence Leu83-Leu88 in factor Xa as a novel recognition site for EPR-1, and suggest its potential role as a protease activation-dependent neo-epitope. This interacting motif may help elucidate the contribution of factor Xa to cellular assembly of coagulation and vascular injury.
18568240	Insights into the regulation of TNF-alpha production in human mononuclear cells: the effects of non-specific phosphodiesterase inhibition.	OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the effect of nonspecific phosphodiesterase inhibition on transcription factor activation and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human mononuclear cells. INTRODUCTION: The production of TNF-alpha following LPS stimulation is one of the key steps in bacterial sepsis and inflammation. The mechanism by which phosphodiesterase inhibition alters TNF-alpha production in the presence of LPS remains unclear. METHODS: Human mononuclear cells were stimulated with LPS (1 microg/mL), in the presence and absence of Pentoxifylline (PTX; 20 mM), a nonspecific phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Western blotting of phosphorylated cytoplasmic I-kBalpha, nuclear factor-kB p65 (NF-kB), and nuclear cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) was performed. DNA binding of NF-kB and CREB was verified by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. TNF-a levels were determined in the supernatant of stimulated cells in the presence and absence Protein kinase A inhibition by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: PTX was demonstrated to significantly reduce cytoplasmic I-kBalpha phosphorylation, nuclear p65 phosphorylation, and the DNA binding activity of NF-kB. In contrast, PTX markedly enhanced the phosphorylation and DNA binding activity of CREB. Cells concomitantly treated with PTX and LPS secreted similar levels of TNF-a in the presence and absence Protein kinase A inhibition. DISCUSSION: The increased level of cAMP that results from phosphodiesterase inhibition affects cytoplasmic and nuclear events, resulting in the attenuation of NF-kB and the activation of CREB transcriptional DNA binding through pathways that are partially Protein kinase A-independent. CONCLUSION: PTX-mediated phosphodiesterase inhibition occurs partially through a Protein kinase A-independent pathway and may serve as a useful tool in the attenuation of LPS-induced inflammation.
16530878	Direct molecular and spectroscopic evidence for increased ammonia removal capacity of skeletal muscle in acute liver failure.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: It has been proposed that, in acute liver failure, skeletal muscle adapts to become the principle organ responsible for removal of blood-borne ammonia by increasing glutamine synthesis, a reaction that is catalyzed by the cytosolic ATP-dependent enzyme glutamine synthetase. To address this issue, glutamine synthetase expression and activities were measured in skeletal muscle of rats with acute liver failure resulting from hepatic devascularization. METHODS: Glutamine synthetase protein and gene expression were investigated using immunoblotting and semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Glutamine synthetase activity and glutamine de novo synthesis were measured using, respectively, a standard enzymatic assay and [13C]-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. RESULTS: Glutamine synthetase protein (but not gene) expression and enzyme activities were significantly up-regulated leading to increased de novo synthesis of glutamine and increased skeletal muscle capacity for ammonia removal in acute liver failure. In contrast to skeletal muscle, expression and activities of glutamine synthetase in the brain were significantly decreased. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that skeletal muscle adapts, through a rapid induction of glutamine synthetase, to increase its capacity for removal of blood-borne ammonia in acute liver failure. Maintenance of muscle mass together with the development of agents with the capacity to stimulate muscle glutamine synthetase could provide effective ammonia-lowering strategies in this disorder.
19445548	Atomoxetine: a review of its use in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents.	Atomoxetine (Strattera(R)) is a selective norepinephrine (noradrenaline) reuptake inhibitor that is not classified as a stimulant, and is indicated for use in patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Atomoxetine is effective and generally well tolerated. It is significantly more effective than placebo and standard current therapy and does not differ significantly from or is noninferior to immediate-release methylphenidate; however, it is significantly less effective than the extended-release methylphenidate formulation OROS(R) methylphenidate (hereafter referred to as osmotically released methylphenidate) and extended-release mixed amfetamine salts. Atomoxetine can be administered either as a single daily dose or split into two evenly divided doses, has a negligible risk of abuse or misuse, and is not a controlled substance in the US. Atomoxetine is particularly useful for patients at risk of substance abuse, as well as those who have co-morbid anxiety or tics, or who do not wish to take a controlled substance. Thus, atomoxetine is a useful option in the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents. The mechanism of action of atomoxetine is unclear, but is thought to be related to its selective inhibition of presynaptic norepinephrine reuptake in the prefrontal cortex. Atomoxetine has a high affinity and selectivity for norepinephrine transporters, but little or no affinity for various neurotransmitter receptors. Atomoxetine has a demonstrated ability to selectively inhibit norepinephrine uptake in humans and animals, and studies have shown that it preferentially binds to areas of known high distribution of noradrenergic neurons, such as the fronto-cortical subsystem. Atomoxetine was generally associated with statistically, but not clinically, significant increases in both heart rate and blood pressure in pediatric patients with ADHD. While there was an initial loss in expected height and weight among atomoxetine recipients, this eventually returned to normal in the longer term. Data suggest that atomoxetine is unlikely to have any abuse potential. Atomoxetine appeared less likely than methylphenidate to exacerbate disordered sleep in pediatric patients with ADHD. Atomoxetine is rapidly absorbed, and demonstrates dose-proportional increases in plasma exposure. It undergoes extensive biotransformation, which is affected by poor metabolism by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 in a small percentage of the population; these patients have greater exposure to and slower elimination of atomoxetine than extensive metabolizers. Patients with hepatic insufficiency show an increase in atomoxetine exposure. CYP2D6 inhibitors, such as paroxetine, are associated with changes in atomoxetine pharmacokinetics similar to those observed among poor CYP2D6 metabolizers. Once- or twice-daily atomoxetine was effective in the short-term treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents, as observed in several well designed placebo-controlled trials. Atomoxetine also demonstrated efficacy in the longer term treatment of these patients. A single morning dose was shown to be effective into the evening, and discontinuation of atomoxetine was not associated with symptom rebound. Atomoxetine efficacy did not appear to differ between children and adolescents. Stimulant-naive patients also responded well to atomoxetine treatment. Atomoxetine did not differ significantly from or was noninferior to immediate-release methylphenidate in children and adolescents with ADHD with regard to efficacy, and was significantly more effective than standard current therapy (any combination of medicines [excluding atomoxetine] and/or behavioral counseling, or no treatment). However, atomoxetine was significantly less effective than osmotically released methylphenidate and extended-release mixed amfetamine salts. The efficacy of atomoxetine did not appear to be affected by the presence of co-morbid disorders, and symptoms of the co-morbid disorders were not affected or were improved by atomoxetine administration. Health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) appeared to be positively affected by atomoxetine in both short- and long-term studies; atomoxetine also improved HR-QOL to a greater extent than standard current therapy. Atomoxetine was generally well tolerated in children and adolescents with ADHD. Common adverse events included headache, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, vomiting, somnolence, and nausea. The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate; there was a very low incidence of serious adverse events. Few patients discontinued atomoxetine treatment because of adverse events. Atomoxetine discontinuation appeared to be well tolerated, with a low incidence of discontinuation-emergent adverse events. Atomoxetine appeared better tolerated among extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers than among poor metabolizers. Slight differences were evident in the adverse event profiles of atomoxetine and stimulants, both immediate- and extended-release. Somnolence appeared more common among atomoxetine recipients and insomnia appeared more common among stimulant recipients. A black-box warning for suicidal ideation has been published in the US prescribing information, based on findings from a meta-analysis showing that atomoxetine is associated with a significantly higher incidence of suicidal ideation than placebo. Rarely, atomoxetine may also be associated with serious liver injury; postmarketing data show that three patients have had liver-related adverse events deemed probably related to atomoxetine treatment. Treatment algorithms involving the initial use of atomoxetine appear cost effective versus algorithms involving initial methylphenidate (immediate- or extended-release), dexamfetamine, tricyclic antidepressants, or no treatment in stimulant-naive, -failed, and -contraindicated children and adolescents with ADHD. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year is below commonly accepted cost-effectiveness thresholds, as shown in several Markov model analyses conducted from the perspective of various European countries, with a time horizon of 1 year.
23348514	Effects of metformin on burn-induced hepatic endoplasmic reticulum stress in male rats.	Severe burn injury causes hepatic dysfunction that results in major metabolic derangements including insulin resistance and hyperglycemia and is associated with hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We have recently shown that insulin reduces ER stress and improves liver function and morphology; however, it is not clear whether these changes are directly insulin mediated or are due to glucose alterations. Metformin is an antidiabetic agent that decreases hyperglycemia by different pathways than insulin; therefore, we asked whether metformin affects postburn ER stress and hepatic metabolism. The aim of the present study is to determine the effects of metformin on postburn hepatic ER stress and metabolic markers. Male rats were randomized to sham, burn injury and burn injury plus metformin and were sacrificed at various time points. Outcomes measured were hepatic damage, function, metabolism and ER stress. Burn-induced decrease in albumin mRNA and increase in alanine transaminase (p < 0.01 versus sham) were not normalized by metformin treatment. In addition, ER stress markers were similarly increased in burn injury with or without metformin compared with sham (p < 0.05). We also found that gluconeogenesis and fatty acid metabolism gene expressions were upregulated with or without metformin compared with sham (p < 0.05). Our results indicate that, whereas thermal injury results in hepatic ER stress, metformin does not ameliorate postburn stress responses by correcting hepatic ER stress.
17273750	Cimetidine induces apoptosis of human salivary gland tumor cells.	It has been reported that cimetidine, a histamine type-2 receptor (H2R) antagonist, inhibits the growth of glandular tumors such as colorectal cancer. However, its effects against salivary gland tumors are still unknown. We demonstrated previously that human salivary gland tumor (HSG) cells spontaneously express the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and also that HSG cell proliferation could be controlled via a homophilic (NCAM-NCAM) binding mechanism and that NCAM may be associated with perineural invasion by malignant salivary gland tumors. In the present study, we investigated the effects of cimetidine via the expression of NCAM on tumor growth and perineural/neural invasion in salivary gland tumor cells. Expression of both NCAM mRNA and protein was found to decrease in a dose-dependent manner upon treatment with cimetidine for 24 h. The MTT assay and confocal laser microscopy clearly showed that HSG cells underwent apoptosis after treatment with cimetidine. Activation of caspases 3, 7, 8 and 9 was observed in HSG cells after cimetidine treatment, thus confirming that the apoptosis was induced by the activated caspases. Apaf-1 activity was also detected in HSG cells in a dose-dependent manner after treatment with cimetidine. We also found that the cimetidine-mediated down-regulation of NCAM expression in HSG cells did not occur via blocking of the histamine receptor, even though H2R expression was observed on HSG cells, as two other H2R antagonists, famotidine and ranitidine, did not show similar effects. We demonstrated for the first time that cimetidine can induce significant apoptosis of salivary gland tumor cells, which express NCAM, at least in part by down-regulation of NCAM expression on the cells. These findings suggest that the growth, development and perineural/neural invasion of salivary gland tumor cells can be blocked by cimetidine administration through down-regulation of NCAM expression, as well as induction of apoptosis.
17620346	Covalent binding of rofecoxib, but not other cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, to allysine aldehyde in elastin of human aorta.	In rats, it has been reported that rofecoxib, a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, reacts with the aldehyde group of allysine in elastin to give a condensation covalent adduct, thereby preventing the formation of cross-linkages in the elastin and causing degradation of the elastic fibers in aortas in vivo. Acid, organic solvent, and proteolytic enzyme treatments of human aortic homogenate after incubation with [(14)C]rofecoxib demonstrated that most of the radioactivity is covalently bound to elastin. The in vitro covalent binding was inhibited in the presence of beta-aminopropionitrile, D-penicillamine, and hydralazine, which suggested that the aldehyde group of allysine in human elastin was relevant to the covalent binding. The in vitro covalent binding of [(14)C]rofecoxib was significantly decreased by the addition of only nonradiolabeled rofecoxib but not the other COX-2 inhibitors, celecoxib, valdecoxib, etoricoxib, and CS-706 [2-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl 1-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)-1H-pyrrole], a novel selective COX-2 inhibitor. All the above COX-2 inhibitors except for rofecoxib had no reactivity with the aldehyde group of benzaldehyde used as a model compound of allysine aldehyde under a physiological pH condition. On the other hand, no retention of the radioactivity of [(14)C]rofecoxib was observed in human aortic endothelial cells in vitro, suggesting that rofecoxib is not retained in aortic endothelial cells in vivo. These results suggest that rofecoxib, but not other COX-2 inhibitors, is capable of covalently binding to the aldehyde group of allysine in human elastin. This might be one of the main causes of cardiovascular events by rofecoxib in clinical situations.
23477619	DNA Adducts in Aldehyde Dehydrogenase-Positive Lung Stem Cells of A/J Mice Treated with the Tobacco Specific Lung Carcinogen 4-(Methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK).	Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the world. Evidence suggests that lung cancer could originate from mutations accumulating in a subpopulation of self-renewing cells, lung stem cells. Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) is a marker of stem cells. To investigate the presence of DNA modifications in these cells, we isolated ALDH-positive lung cells from A/J mice exposed to the lung carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone. Using LC-NSI-HRMS/MS-PRM, O(6)-methyl-G, 7-POB-G, and O(2)-POB-dT were positively identified in ALDH-positive cell DNA. This is the first example of detection of carcinogen-DNA adducts in lung stem cells, supporting the hypothesis of their role in lung carcinogenesis.
18684057	Optimizing denileukin diftitox (Ontak) therapy.	Denileukin diftitox (Ontak) is a novel recombinant fusion protein consisting of peptide sequences for the enzymatically active and membrane translocation domain of diphtheria toxin linked to human IL-2. Denileukin diftitox specifically binds to IL-2 receptors on the cell membrane, is internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis and inhibits protein synthesis by ADP ribosylation of elongation factor 2, resulting in cell death. This article focuses on the clinical trial that led to the US FDA approval of the drug for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in 1999, and other investigational studies for hematologic malignancies, recurrent and refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma, graft-versus-host disease and autoimmune disease, demonstrating the activity and adverse effects of the drug.
17181139	Scaffold of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor carprofen provides Alzheimer gamma-secretase modulators.	N-sulfonylated and N-alkylated carprofen derivatives were investigated for their inhibition and modulation of gamma-secretase, which is associated with Alzheimer's disease. The introduction of a lipophilic substituent transformed the COX-2 inhibitor carprofen into a potent gamma-secretase modulator. Several compounds (e.g., 9p, 11f) caused selective reduction of Abeta42 and an increase of Abeta38. The most active compounds displayed activities in the low micromolar range and no effect on the gamma-secretase cleavage at the e-site.
16973729	Hyperphagia alters expression of hypothalamic 5-HT2C and 5-HT1B receptor genes and plasma des-acyl ghrelin levels in Ay mice.	The central melanocortin (MC) pathway is suggested to mediate satiety signaling downstream of serotonin (5-HT)2C receptors. 5-HT2C receptor mutant mice consume more food, which leads to late-onset obesity and impaired glucose tolerance. Ay mice with ectopic expression of the agouti peptide, which leads to a perturbation of the central MC pathway, develop obesity and diabetes, associated with low levels of plasma total ghrelin. Here, we report that 5-wk-old Ay mice consumed more food in association with decreases in levels of plasma des-acyl ghrelin, but not active ghrelin, and increases in hypothalamic 5-HT2C and 5-HT1B receptor gene expression compared with wild-type mice matched for age and body weight. These alterations were also observed in 8-wk-old obese Ay mice. Restricted feeding significantly decreased hypothalamic 5-HT2C and 5-HT1B receptor gene expression in association with a reversal of the decreases in plasma des-acyl ghrelin levels in 5-wk-old Ay mice. Moreover, restricted feeding reduced body weight, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglycemia in association with increases in plasma des-acyl ghrelin levels in 8-wk-old obese Ay mice. Administration of m-chlorophenylpiperazine and fenfluramine, both of which induce anorexic effects via 5-HT2C receptors and/or 5-HT1B receptors, suppressed food intake in 5- and 8-wk-old Ay mice, whereas the anorexic effects were attenuated in food-restricted Ay mice. These findings suggest that the agouti peptide down-regulates hypothalamic 5-HT2C and 5-HT1B receptor gene expression under restricted feeding conditions, whereas chronic hyperphagia increases the expression of these genes and decreases plasma des-acyl ghrelin levels in Ay mice.
23376438	Cellular mechanisms of the cytotoxic effects of the zearalenone metabolites α-zearalenol and β-zearalenol on RAW264.7 macrophages.	Zearalenone (ZEN) and its metabolites are commonly found in many food commodities and are known to cause reproductive disorders and genotoxic effects. The major ZEN metabolites are α-zearalenol (α-ZOL) and β-zearalenol (β-ZOL). Although many studies have demonstrated the cytotoxic effects of these metabolites, the mechanisms by which α-ZOL or β-ZOL mediates their cytotoxic effects appear to differ according to cell type and the exposed toxins. We evaluated the toxicity of α-ZOL and β-ZOL on RAW264.7 macrophages and investigated the underlying mechanisms. β-ZOL not only more strongly reduced the viability of cells than did α-ZOL, but it also induced cell death mainly by apoptosis rather than necrosis. The ZEN metabolites induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), mitochondrial changes in Bcl-2 and Bax proteins, and cytoplasmic release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Use of an inhibitor specific to c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 kinase or p53, but not pan-caspase or caspase-8, decreased the toxin-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and also attenuated the α-ZOL- or β-ZOL-induced decrease of cell viability. Antioxidative enzyme or compounds such as catalase, acteoside, and (E)-1-(3,4-dihydroxyphenethyl)-3-(4-hydroxystyryl)urea suppressed the ZEN metabolite-mediated reduction of cell viability. Further, knockdown of AIF via siRNA transfection diminished the ZEN metabolite-induced cell death. Collectively, these results suggest that the activation of p53, JNK or p38 kinase by ZEN metabolites is the main upstream signal required for the mitochondrial alteration of Bcl-2/Bax signaling pathways and intracellular ROS generation, while MMP loss and nuclear translocation of AIF are the critical downstream events for ZEN metabolite-mediated apoptosis in macrophages.
11146120	Pharmacological modulation of nerve growth factor synthesis: a mechanistic comparison of vitamin D receptor and beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists.	Increasing nerve growth factor (NGF) in the PNS is a rational strategy for treating certain neurodegenerative disorders. The present studies were undertaken to compare two compounds, a vitamin D(3) analogue (CB1093) with minimal calcaemic effects, and clenbuterol, a long-acting beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist, both of which induce NGF synthesis in vivo. Clenbuterol caused significant increases in both NGF mRNA and protein in 3T3 cells; with maxima at 10 nM and at 8-12 h exposure. Effects of clenbuterol on NGF mRNA were antagonized by propranolol. Mobility shift assays on whole cell extracts showed that clenbuterol increased AP1 binding in 3T3 cells prior to increasing NGF synthesis. Clenbuterol was without effect on NGF mRNA levels in L929 cells, whereas CB1093 caused significant increases in both NGF mRNA and protein levels in both 3T3 and L929 cells. Stimulation was almost maximal at 24 h exposure and was sustained for at least 72 h. The magnitude of the increase was much greater in L929 (700% increase) than in 3T3 cells (80%). Binding to the vitamin D nuclear receptor (VDR), which acts as a transcription factor itself, was increased as early as 30 min after exposure to of CB1093 and maintained up to 24 h. Increased VDR binding preceded increased NGF mRNA. A 150% increase in AP-1 binding was also evident. This study demonstrates that CB1093 and clenbuterol stimulate NGF levels in vitro and that AP-1 binding could be a commonality between the mechanism of NGF induction of these two compounds.
23300056	Determination of key receptor-ligand interactions of dopaminergic arylpiperazines and the dopamine D2 receptor homology model.	Interest in structure-based G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) ligand discovery is huge, given that almost 30 % of all approved drugs belong to this category of active compounds. The GPCR family includes the dopamine receptor subtype D2 (D2DR), but unfortunately--as is true of most GPCRs--no experimental structures are available for these receptors. In this publication, we present the molecular model of D2DR based on the previously published crystal structure of the dopamine D3 receptor (D3DR). A molecular modeling study using homology modeling and docking simulation provided a rational explanation for the behavior of the arylpiperazine ligand. The observed binding modes and receptor-ligand interactions provided us with fresh clues about how to optimize selectivity for D2DR receptors.
15299009	A disorder to order transition accompanies catalysis in retinaldehyde dehydrogenase type II.	Retinaldehyde dehydrogenase II (RalDH2) converts retinal to the transcriptional regulator retinoic acid in the developing embryo. The x-ray structure of the enzyme revealed an important structural difference between this protein and other aldehyde dehydrogenases of the same enzyme superfamily; a 20-amino acid span in the substrate access channel in retinaldehyde dehydrogenase II is disordered, whereas in other aldehyde dehydrogenases this region forms a well defined wall of the substrate access channel. We asked whether this disordered loop might order during the course of catalysis and provide a means for an enzyme that requires a large substrate access channel to restrict access to the catalytic machinery by smaller compounds that might potentially enter the active site and be metabolized. Our experiments, a combination of kinetic, spectroscopic, and crystallographic techniques, suggest that a disorder to order transition is linked to catalytic activity.
10740137	Statins: effective antiatherosclerotic therapy.	BACKGROUND: Statins are the most effective agents currently available for lowering plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and are the mainstay of therapy for hyperlipidemia. The statins are highly liver-selective, inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, a key enzyme in the synthesis of cholesterol. Several large, controlled clinical trials have confirmed significant reductions in rates of coronary heart disease morbidity and death with long-term statin therapy in patients with mild to severe hypercholesterolemia. METHODS AND RESULTS: This review article is based on a literature search of more than 60 relevant articles from peer-reviewed journals. Search engines included Medline and Embase. In surveying clinical and angiographic evidence, we found that statins appear to reduce the incidence of coronary events by slowing the progression of atherosclerosis and preventing atheromatous lesion formation. We found that the 6 statins currently marketed-atorvastatin, cerivastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin-differ in their inhibitory action on the HMG-CoA reductase enzyme. CONCLUSIONS: The use of more potent statins such as atorvastatin and simvastatin affords greater lowering of LDL-C and triglyceride levels, allowing more patients to achieve target goals. The question of how low LDL-C levels should be lowered will be answered by ongoing clinical trials.
23558236	Design, synthesis and cytotoxicity of cell death mechanism of rotundic acid derivatives.	In the present investigation, 16 new rotundic acid (RA) derivatives modified at the C-3, C-23 and C-28 positions were synthesized. The cytotoxicities of the derivatives were evaluated against HeLa, A375, HepG2, SPC-A1 and NCI-H446 human tumor cell lines by MTT assay. Among these derivatives, compounds 4-7 exhibited stronger cell growth inhibitory than RA and compound 4 was found to be the best inhibition activity on five human tumor cell lines with IC50 <10μM. The apoptosis mechanism of compound 4 in HeLa cells was investigated by western blot analysis. The results indicated that compound 4 could induce apoptosis through increasing protein expression of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax, and decreasing protein expression of Bcl-2. In summary, the present work suggests that compound 4 might serve as an effective chemotherapeutic candidate.
23391443	An intra-articular salmon calcitonin-based nanocomplex reduces experimental inflammatory arthritis.	Prolonged inappropriate inflammatory responses contribute to the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to aspects of osteoarthritis (OA). The orphan nuclear receptor, NR4A2, is a key regulator and potential biomarker for inflammation and represents a potentially valuable therapeutic target. Both salmon calcitonin (sCT) and hyaluronic acid (HA) attenuated activated mRNA expression of NR4A1, NR4A2, NR4A3, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 1, 3 and 13 in three human cell lines: SW1353 chondrocytes, U937 and THP-1 monocytes. Ad-mixtures of sCT and HA further down-regulated expression of NR4A2 compared to either agent alone at specific concentrations, hence the rationale for their formulation in nanocomplexes (NPs) using chitosan. The sCT released from NP stimulated cAMP production in human T47D breast cancer cells expressing sCT receptors. When NP were injected by the intra-articular (I.A.) route to the mouse knee during on-going inflammatory arthritis of the K/BxN serum transfer model, joint inflammation was reduced together with NR4A2 expression, and local bone architecture was preserved. These data highlight remarkable anti-inflammatory effects of sCT and HA at the level of reducing NR4A2 mRNA expression in vitro. Combining them in NP elicits anti-arthritic effects in vivo following I.A. delivery.
23533219	Increased activin bioavailability enhances hepatic insulin sensitivity while inducing hepatic steatosis in male mice.	The development of insulin resistance is tightly linked to fatty liver disease and is considered a major health concern worldwide, although their mechanistic relationship remains controversial. Activin has emerging roles in nutrient homeostasis but its metabolic effects on hepatocytes remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of increased endogenous activin bioactivity on hepatic nutrient homeostasis by creating mice with inactivating mutations that deplete the circulating activin antagonists, follistatin like-3 (FSTL3) or the follistatin 315 isoform (FST315; FST288-only mice). We investigated liver histology and lipid content, hepatic insulin sensitivity, and metabolic gene expression including the HepG2 cell and primary hepatocyte response to activin treatment. Both FSTL3KO and FST288-only mice had extensive hepatic steatosis and elevated hepatic triglyceride (TG) content. Unexpectedly, insulin signaling, as assessed by phospho-AKT, was enhanced in both mouse models. Pretreatment of HepG2 cells with activin A increased their response to subsequent insulin challenge. Gene expression analysis suggests that increased lipid uptake, enhanced de novo lipid synthesis, decreased lipolysis and/or enhanced glucose uptake contribute to increased hepatic TG content in these models. However, activin treatment recapitulated only some of these gene changes suggesting that increased activin bioactivity may be only partially responsible for this phenotype. Nevertheless, our results indicate that activin enhances hepatocyte insulin response which ultimately leads to hepatic steatosis despite the increased insulin sensitivity. Thus, regulation of activin bioactivity is critical for maintaining normal liver lipid homeostasis and response to insulin while activin agonists may be useful for increasing liver insulin sensitivity.
17929831	Kinetic characterization of adenylosuccinate synthetase from the thermophilic archaea Methanocaldococcus jannaschii.	Adenylosuccinate synthetase (AdSS) catalyzes the Mg2+ dependent condensation of a molecule of IMP with aspartate to form adenylosuccinate, in a reaction driven by the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. AdSS from the thermophilic archaea, Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (MjAdSS) is 345 amino acids long against an average length of 430-457 amino acids for most mesophilic AdSS. This short AdSS has two large deletions that map to the middle and C-terminus of the protein. This article discusses the detailed kinetic characterization of MjAdSS. Initial velocity and product inhibition studies, carried out at 70 degrees C, suggest a rapid equilibrium random AB steady-state ordered C kinetic mechanism for the MjAdSS catalyzed reaction. AdSS are known to exhibit monomer-dimer equilibrium with the dimer being implicated in catalysis. In contrast, our studies show that MjAdSS is an equilibrium mixture of dimers and tetramers with the tetramer being the catalytically active form. The tetramer dissociates into dimers with a minor increase in ionic strength of the buffer, while the dimer is extremely stable and does not dissociate even at 1.2 M NaCl. Phosphate, a product of the reaction, was found to be a potent inhibitor of MjAdSS showing biphasic inhibition of enzyme activity. The inhibition was competitive with IMP and noncompetitive with GTP. MjAdSS, like the mouse acidic isozyme, exhibits substrate inhibition, with IMP inhibiting enzyme activity at subsaturating GTP concentrations. Regulation of enzyme activity by the glycolytic intermediate, fructose 1,6 bisphosphate, was also observed with the inhibition being competitive with IMP and noncompetitive against GTP.
23265904	Discovery of liver-targeted inhibitors of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1).	Inhibitors based on a benzo-fused spirocyclic oxazepine scaffold were discovered for stearoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) desaturase 1 (SCD1) and subsequently optimized to potent compounds with favorable pharmacokinetic profiles and in vivo efficacy in reducing the desaturation index in a mouse model. Initial optimization revealed potency preferences for the oxazepine core and benzylic positions, while substituents on the piperidine portions were more tolerant and allowed for tuning of potency and PK properties. After preparation and testing of a range of functional groups on the piperidine nitrogen, three classes of analogs were identified with single digit nanomolar potency: glycine amides, heterocycle-linked amides, and thiazoles. Responding to concerns about target localization and potential mechanism-based side effects, an initial effort was also made to improve liver concentration in an available rat PK model. An advanced compound 17m with a 5-carboxy-2-thiazole substructure appended to the spirocyclic piperidine scaffold was developed which satisfied the in vitro and in vivo requirements for more detailed studies.
23231967	Selective and potent adenosine A3 receptor antagonists by methoxyaryl substitution on the N-(2,6-diarylpyrimidin-4-yl)acetamide scaffold.	The influence of diverse methoxyphenyl substitution patterns on the N-(2,6-diarylpyrimidin-4-yl)acetamide scaffold is herein explored in order to modulate the A(3) adenosine receptor antagonistic profile. As a result, novel ligands exhibiting excellent potency (K(i) on A(3) AR < 20 nM) and selectivity profiles (above 100-fold within the adenosine receptors family) are reported. Moreover, our joint theoretical and experimental approach allows the identification of novel pharmacophoric elements conferring A(3)AR selectivity, first established by a robust computational model and thereafter characterizing the most salient features of the structure-activity and structure-selectivity relationships in this series.
23505146	Diverse effects of macromolecular crowding on the sequential glycan-processing pathway involved in glycoprotein quality control.	Compared with in vitro conditions, the intracellular environment is highly crowded with biomolecules; this has numerous effects on protein functions, including enzymatic activity. We examined the effects of macromolecular crowding on glycan processing of N-glycoprotein in the endoplasmic reticulum as a model sequential metabolic pathway. Experiments with synthetic substrates of physiological glycan structure clearly showed that the first half of the pathway (glucose trimming) was accelerated, whereas the second (mannose trimming) was decelerated under molecular crowding conditions. Furthermore, calreticulin, a lectin-like molecular chaperone, bound more strongly to a glycan-processing intermediate under these conditions. This study demonstrates the diverse effects of molecular crowding on sequential enzymatic processing, and the importance of the effects of macromolecular crowding on in vitro assays for understanding sequential metabolic pathways.
23508961	Agonist-induced Down-regulation of Endogenous Protein Kinase C α through an Endolysosomal Mechanism.	Protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes undergo down-regulation upon sustained stimulation. Previous studies have pointed to the existence of both proteasome-dependent and -independent pathways of PKCα processing. Here we demonstrate that these down-regulation pathways are engaged in different subcellular compartments; proteasomal degradation occurs mainly at the plasma membrane, whereas non-proteasomal processing occurs in the perinuclear region. Using cholesterol depletion, pharmacological inhibitors, RNA interference, and dominant-negative mutants, we define the mechanisms involved in perinuclear accumulation of PKCα and identify the non-proteasomal mechanism mediating its degradation. We show that intracellular accumulation of PKCα involves at least two clathrin-independent, cholesterol/lipid raft-mediated pathways that do not require ubiquitination of the protein; one is dynamin-dependent and likely involves caveolae, whereas the other is dynamin- and small GTPase-independent. Internalized PKCα traffics through endosomes and is delivered to the lysosome for degradation. Supportive evidence includes (a) detection of the enzyme in EEA1-positive early endosomes, Rab7-positive late endosomes/multivesicular bodies, and LAMP1-positive lysosomes and (b) inhibition of its down-regulation by lysosome-disrupting agents and leupeptin. Only limited dephosphorylation of PKCα occurs during trafficking, with fully mature enzyme being the main target for lysosomal degradation. These studies define a novel and widespread mechanism of desensitization of PKCα signaling that involves endocytic trafficking and lysosome-mediated degradation of the mature, fully phosphorylated protein.
15686475	Effect of apocalmodulin on recombinant human brain glutamic acid decarboxylase.	In this work, we report that the recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-human L-glutamic acid decarboxylase (HGAD) isoforms, 65-kDa L-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) (GST-HGAD65) fusion protein or free truncated HGAD65, were activated by apocalmodulin (ApoCaM) to an extent of 60%. Both truncated forms of GAD67 (tGAD67), HGAD67(Delta1-70) and HGAD67(Delta1-90), were markedly activated by ApoCaM to an extent of 141 and 85%, respectively, while GST-HGAD67 was not significantly affected. The activation appears to be due to an increase of GAD affinity for its cofactor, pyridoxal phosphate (PLP). This conclusion is based on the following observations. Firstly, the V(max) of GAD was increased when ApoCaM was present whereas the affinity for the substrate, glutamate, was not affected. Secondly, the affinity of GAD for PLP was increased in the presence of ApoCaM. Thirdly, results from calmodulin-agarose affinity column chromatography studies indicated a direct interaction or binding between ApoCaM and GAD. Fourthly, ApoCaM was found to be copurified with GAD65/GAD67 by anti-GAD65/67 immunoaffinity column using rat brain extract. Hence, it is proposed that a conformational change is induced when ApoCaM interacts with GAD65 or tGAD67, resulting in an increase of GAD affinity for PLP and the activation of GAD. The physiological significance of the interaction between GAD and ApoCaM is discussed.
23281613	Two new ent-3,4-seco-labdane diterpenoids from Callicarpa nudiflora.	Two new ent-3,4-seco-labdane diterpenoids, methylcallicarpate (1) and callicarpic acid (2), were isolated from the leaves of Callicarpa nudiflora Hook et Arn. Their structures and relative configurations were established by analysis of spectroscopic data. Their absolute configurations were assigned by the application of the CD technique for the first time among the ent-3,4-seco-labdane-type diterpenes.
10208491	Genetic causes of mild hyperhomocysteinemia in patients with premature occlusive coronary artery diseases.	Elevated plasma homocysteine is increasingly being recognized as a risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD). Although there is general agreement on the importance of micronutrients and genetic predisposition to elevated plasma homocysteine, the exact influence of the known prevalent mutations in genes which regulate homocysteine metabolism is not clear. We studied 376 cases of individuals with premature CAD with respect to their fasting and post-methionine load (PML) total homocysteine (tHcy) concentrations. We also determined the presence or absence of the T833C and G919A mutations of the cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) gene, the C677T mutation of the methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene, and the A2756G transition of the B12 dependent methionine synthase (MS) gene. Our objectives were therefore both to confirm the relationship of plasma homocysteine with premature CAD and to examine the importance of genetic influence on both fasting and PML homocysteine. Approximately 32% of the CAD patients had fasting hyperhomocysteinemia and 16% had PML hyperhomocysteinemia. Of these, 8.5% had both forms of hyperhomocysteinemia (combined hyperhomocysteinemia). The T133C mutation in the CBS gene and the thermolabile C677T mutation in the MTHFR gene seem to play an important role in the subset of individuals with combined hyperhomocysteinemia. The A2756G transition in the MS gene is not associated with elevated plasma tHcy. Many cases (47%) of hyperhomocysteinemia are not associated with micronutrient deficiencies, impaired renal function, and/or currently known genetic mutations. Further work is needed to study whether unknown mutations, particularly those residing in the intronic sequences of the genes involved in homocysteine metabolism, other environmental factors, or interaction of gene, nutrient, and environmental factors may be the cause of currently unexplained cases of mild hyperhomocysteinemia.
23312283	Trimethylamine-N-oxide, a metabolite associated with atherosclerosis, exhibits complex genetic and dietary regulation.	Circulating trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) levels are strongly associated with atherosclerosis. We now examine genetic, dietary, and hormonal factors regulating TMAO levels. We demonstrate that two flavin mono-oxygenase family members, FMO1 and FMO3, oxidize trimethylamine (TMA), derived from gut flora metabolism of choline, to TMAO. Further, we show that FMO3 exhibits 10-fold higher specific activity than FMO1. FMO3 overexpression in mice significantly increases plasma TMAO levels while silencing FMO3 decreases TMAO levels. In both humans and mice, hepatic FMO3 expression is reduced in males compared to females. In mice, this reduction in FMO3 expression is due primarily to downregulation by androgens. FMO3 expression is induced by dietary bile acids by a mechanism that involves the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a bile acid-activated nuclear receptor. Analysis of natural genetic variation among inbred strains of mice indicates that FMO3 and TMAO are significantly correlated, and TMAO levels explain 11% of the variation in atherosclerosis.
9670923	Cloning and characterization of alpha1H from human heart, a member of the T-type Ca2+ channel gene family.	Voltage-activated Ca2+ channels exist as multigene families that share common structural features. Different Ca2+ channels are distinguished by their electrophysiology and pharmacology and can be classified as either low or high voltage-activated channels. Six alpha1 subunit genes cloned previously code for high voltage-activated Ca2+ channels; therefore, we have used a database search strategy to identify new Ca2+ channel genes, possibly including low voltage-activated (T-type) channels. A novel expressed sequence-tagged cDNA clone of alpha1G was used to screen a cDNA library, and in the present study, we report the cloning of alpha1H (or CavT.2), a low voltage-activated Ca2+ channel from human heart. Northern blots of human mRNA detected more alpha1H expression in peripheral tissues, such as kidney and heart, than in brain. We mapped the gene, CACNA1H, to human chromosome 16p13.3 and mouse chromosome 17. Expression of alpha1H in HEK-293 cells resulted in Ca2+ channel currents displaying voltage dependence, kinetics, and unitary conductance characteristic of native T-type Ca2+ channels. The alpha1H channel is sensitive to mibefradil, a nondihydropyridine Ca2+ channel blocker, with an IC50 of 1.4 micromol/L, consistent with the reported potency of mibefradil for T-type Ca2+ channels. Together with alpha1G, a rat brain T-type Ca2+ channel also cloned in our laboratory, these genes define a unique family of Ca2+ channels.
23541982	Potential diagnostic applications of side chain oxysterols analysis in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid.	The neurospecific cholesterol 24-hydroxylase converts excess brain cholesterol into 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24OHC) which, via the liver X receptor (LXR), can increase the expression and synthesis of astrocyte ApoE. 24OHC effluxes directly from brain into plasma where it is considered an indicator of brain cholesterol turnover. It is reduced in neurodegenerative disease states proportionally to the severity of disease and the degree of brain atrophy. In the early phases of active disease, a higher rate of turnover may result in transitory increases in plasma 24OHC. Less than 1% of the total brain excretion of 24OHC occurs via the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) whereas almost all 27-hydroxycholesterol (27OHC) excretion is dependent on the function of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. Iincreased CSF oxysterols were found in patients with neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases in the presence of barrier dysfunction. In neurodegeneration, free cholesterol released from dying cells may engulf neurons. Cholesterol also increases Amyloid β (Aβ) deposition and tau pathology. ApoE, 24OHC, tau and soluble APP were correlated in Alzheimer disease (AD) samples. Excess of cholesterol converted into 24OHC may up-regulate ApoE synthesis which is a scavenger for Aβ and Tau. In AD this protective mechanism seems to be inefficient, probably due to the presence of high concentrations of 27OHC, microvascular dysfunction and the decreased efficiency of ApoE4 as lipid transporter and Aβ scavenger. 24OHC itself was cytotoxic. Analysis of side chain oxysterols in the CSF is likely to provided useful information about cholesterol metabolism and ApoE function in the pathogenesis of AD.
23411217	Peyer's patch-mediated intestinal immune system modulating activity of pectic-type polysaccharide from peel of Citrus unshiu.	An intestinal immune system modulating polysaccharide (CUI-3IIb-3-2, 18kDa) was purified from Citrus unshiu peel. CUI-3IIb-3-2 mainly comprised GalA, GlcA, Ara, Gal and Rha, and it consisted of 4-linked GalA, terminal Araf, 4- or 5-linked/3,4- or 3,5-branched Ara, terminal Gal, and 2-linked/2,4-branched Rha. After CUI-3IIb-3-2 digestion by endo-α-d-(1→4)-polygalacturonase, its hydrolysate was fractionated into PG-1 and PG-2. Methylation analyses of PG-1 and PG-2 using base-catalysed β-elimination suggested that CUI-3IIb-3-2 be assumed as pectic-type polysaccharide. Since the activities of PG-1 and PG-2 were potently decreased, the whole polysaccharide structure of CUI-3IIb-3-2 would be essential to maintain the activity. Meanwhile, when CUI-3IIb was orally administered in mice, bone marrow cell proliferation and GM-CSF/IL-6 production from Peyer's patch cell were significantly higher (1.76- and 2.03/2.51-fold, respectively) than a saline. Therefore, a pectic-type polysaccharide from citrus peel could stimulate Peyer's patches and produce hematopoietic growth factors resulted in bone marrow cell proliferation.
18549347	An expert opinion on safinamide in Parkinson's disease.	BACKGROUND: Dopamine replacement therapies (levodopa, dopamine receptor agonists, anticholinergics, monoamine oxidase B inhibitors, and catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors) remain the cornerstones of therapeutic interventions for Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite the treatment options for PD symptoms, a cure remains elusive. An optimal treatment would be one that combined relief in both motor and nonmotor symptoms with neuroprotective properties. Safinamide is an investigational drug for PD currently in development as add-on therapy to both dopamine agonists and levodopa. Safinamide is a unique molecule with a novel mode of action, targeting both dopaminergic and glutaminergic systems, and potentially provides motor symptom control. Preliminary results from experimental models suggest potential neuroprotective effects. Studies on the potential effects on nonmotor symptoms are ongoing. OBJECTIVE: To review the mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics, and to evaluate the available clinical safety and efficacy results of safinamide. METHODS: A search of the electronic database MEDLINE (PubMed, no time limits) was performed on 14 December 2007. The full text of all citations was obtained for review. Furthermore, two abstracts on safinamide published as proceedings of a European conference were reviewed. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: Safinamide is a promising investigational drug for PD with a novel mode of action. Early reports confirm the potential efficacy of safinamide in PD. Further studies on potential effects on cognition and neuroprotection are needed.
10368299	Structure of acetylcholinesterase complexed with E2020 (Aricept): implications for the design of new anti-Alzheimer drugs.	BACKGROUND: Several cholinesterase inhibitors are either being utilized for symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease or are in advanced clinical trials. E2020, marketed as Aricept, is a member of a large family of N-benzylpiperidine-based acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors developed, synthesized and evaluated by the Eisai Company in Japan. These inhibitors were designed on the basis of QSAR studies, prior to elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of Torpedo californica AChE (TcAChE). It significantly enhances performance in animal models of cholinergic hypofunction and has a high affinity for AChE, binding to both electric eel and mouse AChE in the nanomolar range. RESULTS: Our experimental structure of the E2020-TcAChE complex pinpoints specific interactions responsible for the high affinity and selectivity demonstrated previously. It shows that E2020 has a unique orientation along the active-site gorge, extending from the anionic subsite of the active site, at the bottom, to the peripheral anionic site, at the top, via aromatic stacking interactions with conserved aromatic acid residues. E2020 does not, however, interact directly with either the catalytic triad or the 'oxyanion hole', but only indirectly via solvent molecules. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows, a posteriori, that the design of E2020 took advantage of several important features of the active-site gorge of AChE to produce a drug with both high affinity for AChE and a high degree of selectivity for AChE versus butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). It also delineates voids within the gorge that are not occupied by E2020 and could provide sites for potential modification of E2020 to produce drugs with improved pharmacological profiles.
23271742	Arsenic suppresses cell survival via Pirh2-mediated proteasomal degradation of ΔNp63 protein.	Transcription factor p63, a member of the p53 family, shares a high degree of sequence similarity with p53. Because of transcription from two distinct promoters, the p63 gene encodes two isoforms, TAp63 and ΔNp63. Although TAp63 acts as a tumor suppressor, ΔNp63 functions as an oncogene and is often overexpressed in squamous cell carcinomas. Thus, therapeutic agents targeting ΔNp63 might be used to manage tumors that overexpress ΔNp63. Here we found that arsenic trioxide, a frontline agent for acute promyelocytic leukemia, inhibits ΔNp63 but not TAp63 expression in time- and dose-dependent manners. In addition, we found that arsenic trioxide decreases the stability of ΔNp63 protein via a proteasome-dependent pathway but has little effect on the level of ΔNp63 transcript. Furthermore, we found that arsenic trioxide activates the Pirh2 promoter and consequently induces Pirh2 expression. Consistent with this, we found that knockdown of Pirh2 inhibits, whereas ectopic expression of Pirh2 enhances, arsenic-induced degradation of ΔNp63 protein. Importantly, we found that knockdown of ΔNp63 sensitizes, whereas ectopic expression of ΔNp63 inhibits, growth suppression induced by arsenic. Together, these data suggest that arsenic degrades ΔNp63 protein at least in part via Pirh2-dependent proteolysis and that inhibition of ΔNp63 expression facilitates tumor cells to arsenic-induced death.
23639249	Indoxyl 3-sulfate stimulates Th17 differentiation enhancing phosphorylation of c-Src and STAT3 to worsen experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.	Although AhR activation regulates CD4T cell differentiation, how it works has yet to be elucidated. In the present study, using in vitro Th17 differentiation model, we examined effects of AhR activation by indoxyl 3-sulfate (I3S), a uremic toxin, on Th17 differentiation and investigated underlying mechanisms. I3S increased expression of RORγt, the master transcription factor for Th17 differentiation, and stimulated Th17 differentiation, in a comparative manner as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), a prototypical AhR ligand. Activation of STAT3, which is phosphorylated by the IL-6 signaling pathways and thus is necessary for Th17 differentiation, was strongly stimulated by I3S and TCDD. Phosphorylation of c-Src, which was shown to be activated by AhR ligands, was also increased by I3S and TCDD, and blocking of c-Src activity by 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl) pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2) inhibited phosphorylation of both c-Src and STAT3, raising a possibility that stimulatory activities of I3S and TCDD on Th17 differentiation could be exerted via increased phosphorylation of c-Src, which in turn stimulates STAT3 activation. Finally, we found that I3S worsened experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), which is primarily mediated by Th17 cells, enhancing the frequency of IL-17-producing cells in draining lymph nodes.
12569076	Desensitization of beta2-adrenoceptor-mediated responses by short-acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonists in human lung mast cells.	1 The principal aim of the present study was to determine whether long-term treatment of human lung mast cells (HLMC) with the clinically-relevant beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists, salbutamol and terbutaline, leads to desensitization of beta(2)-adrenoceptor-mediated responses in these cells. 2 The non-selective beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isoprenaline, and the selective beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists, salbutamol and terbutaline, inhibited the IgE-mediated release of histamine from HLMC. Salbutamol (pD(2); 7.7+/-0.3) and terbutaline (pD(2); 7.3+/-0.2) were roughly equipotent as inhibitors of histamine release although both agonists were less potent than isoprenaline (pD(2); 8.6+/-0.2). 3 Isoprenaline (10(-5) M), salbutamol (10(-5) M) and terbutaline (10(-5) M) enhanced total cell cAMP levels in HLMC over basal by 361+/-90, 150+/-38 and 165+/-35%, respectively. 4 Long-term exposure (24 h) of HLMC to either salbutamol (10(-7) M) or terbutaline (10(-7) M) led to a subsequent reduction in the effectiveness of salbutamol and terbutaline (both 10(-9)-10(-4) M) to inhibit histamine release. However, salbutamol was significantly (P<0.05) more effective than terbutaline at promoting the functional desensitization. 5 Radioligand binding studies, using iodinated cyanopindolol, were performed to determine beta(2)-adrenoceptor density in cell membranes after pretreatment (24 h) of cells with either salbutamol (10(-6) M) or terbutaline (10(-6) M). Both agonists reduced beta(2)-adrenoceptor density in membranes to about the same extent (approximately 25% reduction) but these changes in receptor density were not statistically significant (P>0.05). 6 These data indicate that long-term exposure of mast cells to salbutamol causes greater levels of desensitization to beta(2)-adrenoceptor-mediated responses in HLMC than terbutaline. These findings may have wider clinical significance in the context of asthma treatment as compromised mast cell inhibition could result following long-term exposure of mast cells to short-acting bronchodilators.
16495723	Effects of monoamine oxidase inhibitors on cocaine discrimination in rats.	This study tested the time course of the discriminative stimulus effects of inhibitors of monoamine oxidase alone or in combination with cocaine. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to discriminate cocaine (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) from saline using a two-lever choice methodology. The nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors tranylcypromine (0.01-5 mg/kg) and phenelzine (1-25 mg/kg), the monoamine oxidase-A selective compound clorgyline (1-25 mg/kg), and the monoamine oxidase-B selective compounds pargyline (0.005-50 mg/kg) and selegiline (1-25 mg/kg) were tested for substitution 15 min or 24 h following administration, and in combination with 10 mg/kg of cocaine 24 and 48 h after administration. At 15 min, selegiline fully substituted for the discriminative stimulus effects of cocaine, whereas all other compounds partially substituted. At 24 h, substitution of cocaine was diminished for all compounds except phenelzine, which produced a greater amount of substitution at 24 h than at 15 min. When cocaine was administered 24 h after clorgyline, selegiline, pargyline, and phenelzine, cocaine-appropriate responding was attenuated at intermediate doses of these drugs, whereas the highest doses did not alter cocaine-lever responding. All compounds except selegiline substantially decreased response rate and produced various adverse effects. At 48 h, the effects of all compounds except phenelzine were markedly reduced. Selectivity for monoamine oxidase-A or monoamine oxidase-B did not predict the ability to substitute for or attenuate the subjective effects of cocaine. These findings suggest that monoamine oxidase inhibitors can modulate the discriminative stimulus effects of cocaine for at least 24 h, and may be useful for treatment of cocaine abuse.
23552260	Histological, ultrastructural and immunohistochemical studies on the protective effect of ginger extract against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in male rats.	Cisplatin (CP) is a widely used anticancer drug; however, it has several side effects such as nephrotoxicity. Ginger, the rhizome of Zingiber officinale, consumed since ancient times has numerous health benefits. The objective of this work was to evaluate the protective effect of ginger extract (GE) against CP-induced nephrotoxicity. CP group displayed a marked renal failure characterized by a significant increase in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels in addition to severe histopathological and ultrastructural renal alterations. Also, CP group showed an increase in the immunohistochemical expression of Bax proapoptotic protein. In contrast, GE+CP group showed significant decrease in the elevated serum creatinine and BUN levels and an improvement in the histopathological and ultrastructural renal injury induced by CP. The overexpression of Bax proapoptotic protein was significantly decreased in the GE+CP group. Hence, the present results indicated that GE has a protective effect against CP-induced renal damage in rats. Thereby, such findings recommended the usage of GE to prevent and/or decrease the renal damage induced by CP chemotherapeutic treatment.
11342438	Model for a factor IX activation complex on blood platelets: dimeric conformation of factor XIa is essential.	Human coagulation factor XI (FXI) is a plasma serine protease composed of 2 identical 80-kd polypeptides connected by a disulfide bond. This dimeric structure is unique among blood coagulation enzymes. The hypothesis was tested that dimeric conformation is required for normal FXI function by generating a monomeric version of FXI (FXI/PKA4) and comparing it to wild-type FXI in assays requiring factor IX activation by activated FXI (FXIa). FXI/PKA4 was made by replacing the FXI A4 domain with the A4 domain from prekallikrein (PK). A dimeric version of FXI/PKA4 (FXI/PKA4-Gly326) was prepared as a control. Activated FXI/PKA4 and FXI/PKA4-Gly326 activate factor IX with kinetic parameters similar to those of FXIa. In kaolin-triggered plasma clotting assays containing purified phospholipid, FXI/PKA4 and FXI/PKA4-Gly326 have coagulant activity similar to FXI. The surface of activated platelets is likely to be a physiologic site for reactions involving FXI/FXIa. In competition binding assays FXI/PKA4, FXI/PKA4-Gly326, and FXI have similar affinities for activated platelets (K(i) = 12-16 nM). In clotting assays in which phospholipid is replaced by activated platelets, the dimeric proteins FXI and FXI/PKA4-Gly326 promote coagulation similarly; however, monomeric FXI/PKA4 has greatly reduced activity. Western immunoblot analysis confirmed that activated monomeric FXI/PKA4 activates factor IX poorly in the presence of activated platelets. These findings demonstrate the importance of the dimeric state to FXI activity and suggest a novel model for factor IX activation in which FXIa binds to activated platelets by one chain of the dimer, while binding to factor IX through the other.
15871445	Tolerability of selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor, celecoxib, in patients with analgesic intolerance.	Intolerance reactions to acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are common and caused by inhibition of COX-1 enzyme. Therefore, drugs that selectively inhibit COX-2 enzyme may be safe in these subjects. In this study, we evaluated the tolerability of celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, in patients with analgesic intolerance. The eligible study population consisted of patients with a history of urticaria/angioedema, naso-ocular symptoms, bronchospasm, and/or anaphylactoid reaction induced by ASA and/or NSAIDs. A single-blind, placebo-controlled oral challenge test was performed in the hospital setting. On 2 separate days, 1/4 and 3/4 divided doses of placebo and celecoxib (Celebrex 200 mg, Pfizer, Turkey) were given with 2-hour intervals. Seventy-five subjects (mean age: 38.2 +/- 1.4 years; F:M: 55:20) were included in the study. Twenty-one subjects had asthma. No reaction was observed with placebo or celecoxib provocation. Although celecoxib seems to be a safe alternative drug in our study group, considering its serious adverse events reported in the literature, the drug should be recommended for patients with analgesic intolerance only after being tested by an experienced allergist.
23536271	β-Ionone arrests cell cycle of gastric carcinoma cancer cells by a MAPK pathway.	β-Ionone is an end ring analog of β-carotenoid which has been shown to possess potent anti-proliferative activity both in vitro and in vivo. To investigate the possible inhibitory effects of β-ionone, we studied cell growth characteristics, DNA synthesis, cell cycle progression, as well as mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathways in the human gastric adenocarcinoma cancer cell line (SGC-7901). Our results show that cell growth and DNA synthesis were inhibited, and the cell cycle was arrested at the G0/G1 phase in a dose-dependent manner in cells treated with β-ionone (25, 50, 100 and 200 μmol/L) for 24 h. We found that the β-ionone significantly decreased the extracellular signal-regulated kinase protein expression and significantly increased the levels of p38 and Jun-amino-terminal kinase protein expression (P < 0.01). β-Ionone also inhibited cell cycle-related proteins of Cdk4, Cyclin B1, D1 and increased p27 protein expression in SGC-7901 cells. These results suggested that the cell cycle arrest observed may be regulated through a MAPK pathway by transcriptional down-regulation of cell cycle proteins. These results demonstrate potent ability of β-ionone to arrest cell cycle of SGC-7901 cells and decrease proliferation.
23510510	Dendrimer Driven Self-Assembly of SPR Active Silver-Gold Nanohybrids.	A fourth generation PAMAM dendrimer has been successfully employed for the development of a single step synthesis strategy for self-assembled Ag-Au nanohybrid structures. The surface plasmon resonance properties and the degree of self-assembly of the nanohybrid are strongly correlated with the stoichiometry of the metals which gives rise to enhanced plasmonic properties. The enhanced plasmonic response of the nanohybrids is modeled and is validated experimentally in a model HRP (horseradish peroxidise) bioassay carried out on an SPR-based biochip platform.
23192339	Transcriptional regulatory factor X6 (Rfx6) increases gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) expression in enteroendocrine K-cells and is involved in GIP hypersecretion in high fat diet-induced obesity.	Gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) is an incretin released from enteroendocrine K-cells in response to nutrient ingestion. GIP potentiates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and induces energy accumulation into adipose tissue, resulting in obesity. Plasma GIP levels are reported to be increased in the obese state. However, the molecular mechanisms of GIP secretion and high fat diet (HFD)-induced GIP hypersecretion remain unclear, primarily due to difficulties in separating K-cells from other intestinal epithelial cells in vivo. In this study, GIP-GFP knock-in mice that enable us to visualize K-cells by enhanced GFP were established. Microarray analysis of isolated K-cells from these mice revealed that transcriptional regulatory factor X6 (Rfx6) is expressed exclusively in K-cells. In vitro experiments using the mouse intestinal cell line STC-1 showed that knockdown of Rfx6 decreased mRNA expression, cellular content, and secretion of GIP. Rfx6 bound to the region in the gip promoter that regulates gip promoter activity, and overexpression of Rfx6 increased GIP mRNA expression. HFD induced obesity and GIP hypersecretion in GIP-GFP heterozygous mice in vivo. Immunohistochemical and flow cytometry analysis showed no significant difference in K-cell number between control fat diet-fed (CFD) and HFD-fed mice. However, GIP content in the upper small intestine and GIP mRNA expression in K-cells were significantly increased in HFD-fed mice compared with those in CFD-fed mice. Furthermore, expression levels of Rfx6 mRNA were increased in K-cells of HFD-fed mice. These results suggest that Rfx6 increases GIP expression and content in K-cells and is involved in GIP hypersecretion in HFD-induced obesity.
10363282	Role of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) secreted by parasitic nematodes on the growth of the cell line from epithelial origin HT29-D4.	The excretory-secretory (E-S) products of the parasitic nematodes Trichostrongylus colubriformis and Nematodirus battus were found to modify the in vitro proliferation of the tumorous colic HT29-D4 cell line of epithelial origin. A characteristic feature of these E-S products is the presence of a high level of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, the biological significance of which remains unclear. To determine a possible role of AChE on cell growth, the enzyme was purified from E-S products using edrophonium chloride. Purity was confirmed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, using silver and Karnovsky stains, before assessing its effects on cell proliferation. The purified AChE was incorporated at different concentrations in a culture medium of HT29-D4 cells. A mitogenic effect was shown for low concentrations (0.1-14 units). By contrast, an inhibitory effect was noted at high concentrations (35-1400 units). Furthermore, polyclonal antibodies were prepared and depletion of AChE in E-S products by immunoprecipitation or affinity chromatography resulted in a partial or total disappearance of the stimulatory effect of cell growth. Thus, the results form this in vitro study suggest a modulatory role for AChE secreted by nematode parasites on the proliferation of epithelial cells of the host.
23353821	Cystathionase mediates senescence evasion in melanocytes and melanoma cells.	The development of malignant melanoma is a highly complex process, which is still poorly understood. A majority of human melanomas are found to express a few oncogenic proteins, such as mutant RAS and BRAF variants. However, these oncogenes are also found in nevi, and it is now a well-accepted fact that their expression alone leads to senescence. This renders the understanding of senescence escape mechanisms an important point to understand tumor development. Here, we approached the question of senescence evasion by expressing the transcription factor v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (c-MYC), which is known to act synergistically with many oncogenes, in melanocytes. We observed that MYC drives the evasion of reactive-oxygen stress-induced melanocyte senescence, caused by activated receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. Conversely, MIZ1, the growth suppressing interaction partner of MYC, is involved in mediating melanocyte senescence. Both, MYC overexpression and Miz1 knockdown led to a strong reduction of endogenous reactive-oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage and senescence. We identified the cystathionase (CTH) gene product as mediator of the ROS-related MYC and MIZ1 effects. Blocking CTH enzymatic activity in MYC-overexpressing and Miz1 knockdown cells increased intracellular stress and senescence. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of CTH in human melanoma cells also reconstituted senescence in the majority of cell lines, and CTH knockdown reduced tumorigenic effects such as proliferation, H(2)O(2) resistance and soft agar growth. Thus, we identified CTH as new MYC target gene with an important function in senescence evasion.Oncogene advance online publication, 28 January 2013; doi:10.1038/onc.2012.641.
12416991	Kinetics of allopregnanolone formation catalyzed by human 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type III (AKR1C2).	Allopregnanolone is a neurosteroid which exhibits anxiolytic and anticonvulsant activities through potentiation of the GABA(A) receptor. The reduction of 5alpha-dihydroprogesterone (5alpha-DHP), the last step in allopregnanolone biosynthesis, is catalyzed by 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (3alpha-HSDs). While the mechanism of action of allopregnanolone and the physiological and pharmacological modulation of allopregnanolone concentrations in vivo have been extensively studied, there has been little characterization of the kinetics of human 3alpha-HSD catalyzed allopregnanolone formation. We report here determination of the kinetic mechanism for 5alpha-DHP reduction catalyzed by human 3alpha-HSD type III by using steady-state kinetics studies and assessment of the ability of fluoxetine and various other small molecules to activate 3alpha-HSD type III catalyzed allopregnanolone formation. Enzyme-catalyzed 5alpha-DHP reduction yielded two products, allopregnanolone and 5alpha,20alpha-tetrahydroprogesterone, as measured by using a radiometric thin-layer chromatography assay, while 5beta-DHP reduction yielded the neurosteroid pregnanolone as the only product. 5Beta-DHP reduction proceeded with a catalytic efficiency 10 times higher than that of 5alpha-DHP reduction. Two-substrate kinetic analysis and dead-end inhibition studies for 5alpha-DHP reduction and allopregnanolone oxidation indicated that 3alpha-HSD type III utilized a ternary complex (sequential) kinetic mechanism, with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide cofactor binding before steroid substrate and leaving after steroid product. Since previous reports suggested that fluoxetine and certain other small molecules increased allopregnanolone concentrations in vivo by activating 3alpha-HSD type III, we investigated whether these small molecules were able to activate human 3alpha-HSD type III. Our results showed that, at concentrations up to 50 microM, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, norfluoxetine, carbamazepine, clozapine, flurbiprofen, and sulfobromophthalein did not activate the enzyme. These results characterize the role of 3alpha-HSD type III in allopregnanolone formation and suggest that activation of this enzyme by fluoxetine is likely not the mechanism by which fluoxetine increases allopregnanolone concentrations.
9587031	Remethylation defects: guidelines for clinical diagnosis and treatment.	The main remethylation defects include disorders which all have defective methionine synthesis in common. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency impairs methyltetrahydrofolate synthesis, defects in cytosolic reduction of hydroxocobalamin (CblC/D) impair the synthesis of both methyl- and adenosyl cobalamin and deficiencies of methionine synthase (CblE/G) are associated with defective methyl cobalamin synthesis. The clinical presentation is characterized by acute neurological distress in early infancy. In childhood, patients present with progressive encephalopathy with an end-stage which has many signs in common with the adult onset form. In fact, both have more or less severe signs of subacute degeneration of the cord. Cobalamin defective patients must be treated with parenteral supplementation of hydroxocobalamin (1-2 mg per dose). Some methylenetetrahydrofolate patients could be folate responsive and must have a high-dosage folate trial. In addition, oral betaine supplementation (2-9 g per day depending on age) appears an effective means to prevent further neurological deterioration.
16325050	The Arg389Gly beta1-adrenoceptor polymorphism and catecholamine effects on plasma-renin activity.	OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this research was to find out whether, in humans, dobutamine-induced hemodynamic effects and increase in plasma-renin activity (PRA) might be beta1-adrenoceptor (beta1AR) genotype-dependent. BACKGROUND: In vitro Arg389Gly-beta1AR polymorphism exhibits decreased receptor signaling. METHODS: We studied 10 male homozygous Arg389-beta1AR subjects and 8 male homozygous Gly389beta1AR subjects; to avoid influences of codon 49 polymorphism, all were homozygous Ser49-beta1AR. Subjects were infused with dobutamine (1 to 6 microg/kg/min) with or without bisoprolol (10 mg orally) pretreatment, and PRA, heart rate, contractility, and blood pressure were assessed. RESULTS: With regard to PRA, dobutamine increased PRA more potently in Arg389-beta1AR versus Gly389-beta1AR subjects. Bisoprolol markedly suppressed the dobutamine-induced PRA increase in Arg389- but only marginally in Gly389-beta1AR subjects. With regard to hemodynamics, dobutamine caused larger heart rate and contractility increases and diastolic blood pressure decreases in Arg389- versus Gly389-beta1AR subjects. Bisoprolol reduced dobutamine-induced heart rate and contractility increases and diastolic blood pressure decreases more potently in Arg389- versus Gly389-beta1AR subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Codon 389 beta1AR polymorphism is a determinant not only of hemodynamic effects but also of PRA. Thus, beta1AR polymorphisms may be useful for predicting therapeutic responses to betaAR-blocker treatment.
23335106	Fast, reversible, and general photomechanical motion in single crystals of various azo compounds using visible light.	Pseudostilbene-type single crystals exhibit ubiquitous, fast, and reversible photomechanical motion under visible-light irradiation. Push-pull substituents impart extremely rapid switching using just one wavelength of light by shortening the lifetime of the cis-form. This results in a bending motion in the microsecond regime. The influence of crystal density, thickness, and molecular orientation on optimization of the photomechanical effect is investigated.
23001627	Levothyroxine replacement therapy with vitamin E supplementation prevents oxidative stress and cognitive deficit in experimental hypothyroidism.	Hypothyroidism has a variety of adverse effects on cognitive function. The treatment of levothyroxine alone cannot restore cognitive defects of hypothyroid patients. Antioxidant vitamin E supplementation could be useful in disturbances which are associated with oxidative stress and could effectively slow the progression of Alzheimer disease. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate oxidative stress status of the serum and hippocampus in hypothyroidism and to examine the effects of levothyroxine replacement therapy with vitamin E supplementation on cognitive deficit. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups: control group, PTU group, PTU + Vit E group, PTU + L-T4 group, and PTU + L-T4 + Vit E group. Serum and hippocampus malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were determined using the thiobarbituric-acid reactive substances method. Serum and hippocampus superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels were determined by measuring its ability to inhibit the photoreduction of nitroblue tetrazolium. Learning and memory was assessed by Morris water maze test. In the present study, we found that the rats of PTU + Vit E group spent less time to find the platform on days 2, 3, 4, and 5 than the PTU group. Moreover, the rats of PTU + L-T4 + Vit E group spent less time to find the platform on days 4 and 5 than the PTU + L-T4 group. The time spent in the target quadrants was measured in the probe test and no difference was observed in all groups. Oxidative damage has been observed in the serum and hippocampus of hypothyroidism rat. SOD levels of serum and hippocampus tissue were significantly increased and MDA levels were significantly decreased in the PTU + Vit E and PTU + L-T4 + Vit E groups than the PTU and PTU + L-T4 groups. Therefore, these findings indicate that levothyroxine replacement therapy with vitamin E supplementation may ameliorate cognitive deficit in PTU-induced hypothyroidism through the decrease of oxidative stress status.
23380477	Autophagy takes place in mutated p53 neuroblastoma cells in response to hypoxia mimetic CoCl(2).	Solid tumors like neuroblastoma exhibit hypoxic areas, which can lead both to cell death or aggressiveness increase. Hypoxia is a known stress able to induce stabilization of p53, implicated in cell fate regulation. Recently, p53 appeared to be involved in autophagy in an opposite manner, depending on its location: when nuclear, it enhanced transcription of pro-autophagic genes whereas when cytoplasmic, it inhibited the autophagic process. Today, we used cobalt chloride, a hypoxia mimetic that inhibits proteasomal HIF-1 degradation and generates reactive oxygen species (ROS). We focused on CoCl2-induced cell death in a DNA-binding mutated p53 neuroblastoma cell line (SKNBE(2c)). An autophagic signaling was evidenced by an increase of Beclin-1, ATG 5-12, and LC3-II expression whereas the p53(mut) presence decreased with CoCl2 time exposure. Activation of the pathway seemed to protect cells from ROS production and, at least in part, from death. The autophagic inhibitors activated the apoptotic signaling and the death was enhanced. To delineate the eventual implication of the p53(mut) in the autophagic process in response to hypoxia, we monitored signaling in p53(WT)SHSY5Y cells, after either shRNA-p53 down-regulation or transcriptional activity inhibition by pifithrin alpha. We did not detect autophagy neither with p53(wt) nor when p53 was lacking whereas such a response was effective with a mutated or inactivated p53. To conclude, mutated p53 in neuroblastoma cells could be linked with the switch between apoptotic response and cell death by autophagy in response to hypoxic mimetic stress.
20573261	Histamine H4 receptor antagonism diminishes existing airway inflammation and dysfunction via modulation of Th2 cytokines.	BACKGROUND: Airway remodeling and dysfunction are characteristic features of asthma thought to be caused by aberrant production of Th2 cytokines. Histamine H4 receptor (H4R) perturbation has previously been shown to modify acute inflammation and Th2 cytokine production in a murine model of asthma. We examined the ability of H4R antagonists to therapeutically modify the effects of Th2 cytokine production such as goblet cell hyperplasia (GCH), and collagen deposition in a sub-chronic model of asthma. In addition, effects on Th2 mediated lung dysfunction were also determined. METHODS: Mice were sensitized to ovalbumin (OVA) followed by repeated airway challenge with OVA. After inflammation was established mice were dosed with the H4R antagonist, JNJ 7777120, or anti-IL-13 antibody for comparison. Airway hyperreactivity (AHR) was measured, lungs lavaged and tissues collected for analysis. RESULTS: Therapeutic H4R antagonism inhibited T cell infiltration in to the lung and decreased Th2 cytokines IL-13 and IL-5. IL-13 dependent remodeling parameters such as GCH and lung collagen were reduced. Intervention with H4R antagonist also improved measures of central and peripheral airway dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that therapeutic H4R antagonism can significantly ameliorate allergen induced, Th2 cytokine driven pathologies such as lung remodeling and airway dysfunction. The ability of H4R antagonists to affect these key manifestations of asthma suggests their potential as novel human therapeutics.
23293094	Dietary exposure of mink (Mustela vison) to fish from the upper Hudson River, New York, USA: effects on reproduction and offspring growth and mortality.	The effects of feeding farm-raised mink (Mustela vison) diets containing polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-contaminated fish from the upper Hudson River (New York, USA) on adult reproductive performance and kit growth and mortality were evaluated. Diets contained 2.5 to 20% Hudson River fish, providing 0.72 to 6.1 µg ∑PCBs/g feed (4.8-38 pg toxic equivalents [TEQWHO 2005 ]/g feed). The percentage of stillborn kits per litter was significantly increased by dietary concentrations of 4.5 µg ∑PCBs/g feed (28 pg TEQWHO 2005 /g feed) and greater. All offspring exposed to dietary concentrations of 4.5 and 6.1 µg ∑PCBs/g feed (28 and 38 pg TEQWHO 2005 /g feed) died by 10 weeks of age, and all offspring exposed to 1.5 and 2.8 µg ∑PCBs/g feed (10 and 18 pg TEQWHO 2005 /g feed) died by 31 weeks of age, leaving juveniles in the control and 0.72 µg ∑PCBs/g feed (0.41- and 4.8 pg TEQWHO 2005 /g feed) groups only. The dietary concentration predicted to result in 20% kit mortality (LC20) at six weeks of age was 0.34 µg ∑PCBs/g feed (2.6 pg TEQWHO 2005 /g feed). The corresponding maternal hepatic concentration was 0.80 µg ∑PCBs/g liver, wet weight (13 pg TEQWHO 2005 /g liver, wet wt). Mink residing in the upper Hudson River would be expected to consume species of fish that contain an average of 4.0 µg ∑PCBs/g tissue. Thus, a daily diet composed of less than 10% Hudson River fish could provide a dietary concentration of ∑PCBs that resulted in 20% kit mortality in the present study.
23556445	Genomic variation in the MAP3K5 gene is associated with β-thalassemia disease severity and hydroxyurea treatment efficacy.	Aim: In this study we explored the association between genetic variations in MAP3K5 and PDE7B genes, residing on chromosome 6q23, and disease severity in β-hemoglobinopathy patients, as well as the association between these variants with response to hydroxyurea (HU) treatment. Furthermore, we examined MAP3K5 expression in the context of high fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and upon HU treatment in erythroid progenitor cells from healthy and KLF1 haploinsufficient individuals. Materials & methods: For this purpose, we genotyped β-thalassemia intermedia and major patients and healthy controls, as well as a cohort of compound heterozygous sickle cell disease/β-thalassemia patients receiving HU as HbF augmentation treatment. Furthermore, we examined MAP3K5 expression in the context of high HbF and upon HU treatment in erythroid progenitor cells from healthy and KLF1 haploinsufficient individuals. Results: A short tandem repeat in the MAP3K5 promoter and two intronic MAP3K5 gene variants, as well as a PDE7B variant, are associated with low HbF levels and a severe disease phenotype. Moreover, MAP3K5 mRNA expression levels are altered in the context of high HbF and are affected by the presence of HU. Lastly, the abovementioned MAP3K5 variants are associated with HU treatment efficacy. Conclusion: Our data suggest that these MAP3K5 variants are indicative of β-thalassemia disease severity and response to HU treatment.

23618899	Expression of WWOX and FHIT is downregulated by exposure to arsenite in human uroepithelial cells.	Ecological studies in Taiwan, Chile, Argentina, Bangladesh, and Mexico have confirmed significant dose-dependent associations between ingestion of arsenic-contaminated drinking water and the risk of various human malignancies. The FHIT and WWOX genes are active in common fragile sites FRA3B and FRA16D, respectively. Reduced expression of FHIT or WWOX is known to be an early indicator of carcinogen-induced cancers. However, the effect of arsenite on the expressions and molecular mechanisms of these markers is still unclear. The aims of this study were (i) to observe the expression of ATR, WWOX and FHIT proteins in urothelial carcinoma (UC) between endemic and non-endemic areas of blackfoot disease (BFD) by immunohistochemical analyses; (ii) to compare expression of these genes between arsenite-treated SV-HUC-1 human epithelial cells and rat uroepithelial cells; and (iii) to determine the role of DNMT and MEK inhibitors on expressions of WWOX and FHIT in response to arsenite in SV-HUC-1. The experiments revealed that expressions of ATR, WWOX and FHIT in UC significantly differed between BFD areas and non-BFD areas (p=0.003, 0.009 and 0.021, respectively). In fact, the results for the arsenite-treated groups showed that ATR, WWOX and FHIT are downregulated by arsenite in SV-HUC-1. However, the inhibitors suppressed the effects of arsenite on WWOX and FHIT proteins and mRNA expression. In conclusion, arsenite decreased expressions of ATR, WWOX and FHIT via ERK1/2 activation in SV-HUC-1 cells. These findings confirm that dysregulations of these markers may contribute to arsenite-induced carcinogenesis.
7995016	Pharmacokinetic aspects of l-deprenyl (selegiline) and its metabolites.	l-Deprenyl (selegiline), an irreversible and selective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B), is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and distributed into tissues. The reaction between MAO and selegiline takes place in two steps. The initial reversible reaction is followed by an irreversible reaction in which selegiline is bound covalently to the flavin part of the enzyme. Studies with positron emission tomography have shown retention of selegiline in brain areas with high MAO-B activity, including striatal structures, hippocampus, thalamus, and substantia nigra. Inhibition of MAO-B in vivo takes place rapidly; for example, platelet MAO is inhibited almost totally within the first 60 minutes after a single 10 mg oral dose of the drug. The recovery of MAO after inhibition depends on the organ and species in question. In rat brain the half-life of recovery in the brain is approximately 8 to 12 days; in rat liver it is shorter, 1 to 3 days. Selegiline is metabolized into l-(-)-desmethylselegiline, l-(-)-methamphetamine, and l-(-)-amphetamine mainly in the liver through the microsomal P-450 system. The stereoselectivity of the metabolites is maintained; no racemic transformation takes place. All three main metabolites are found in human serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine, and l-(-)-methamphetamine accounts for most of the metabolite pool. The metabolites are excreted mainly via urine l-(-)-Desmethylselegiline has been shown to be an irreversible inhibitor of MAO-B in the rat and in humans.
3320565	Pharmacological and clinical studies of the antiandrogen Anandron.	This paper summarizes the animal and human studies with Anandron available at the time of the meeting. The following was demonstrated in the rat and confirmed in man: interaction of Anandron with the prostatic androgen receptor, antiandrogen activity against testosterone (in particular against the early transient rise induced by LHRH analogs) and adrenal androgens. Thus, as shown in 4 different double blind studies performed in stage D2 prostrate cancer patients, the combination of Anandron with surgical or chemical castration enhanced the beneficial effects of castration alone and thus seems a step forward in the hormonal treatment of prostatic carcinoma.
9374794	Blockage of the HERG human cardiac K+ channel by the gastrointestinal prokinetic agent cisapride.	Cisapride, a gastrointestinal prokinetic agent, is known to cause long Q-T syndrome and ventricular arrhythmias. The cellular mechanism is not known. The human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG), which encodes the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K+ current and is important in cardiac repolarization, may serve as a target for the action of cisapride. We tested the hypothesis that cisapride blocks HERG. The whole cell patch-clamp recording technique was used to study HERG channels stably expressed heterologously in HEK293 cells. Under voltage-clamp conditions, cisapride block of HERG is dose dependent with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 6.5 nM at 22 degrees C (n = 25 cells). Currents rapidly recovered with drug washout. The onset of block by cisapride required channel activation indicative of open or inactivated state blockage. Block of HERG with cisapride after channel activation was voltage dependent. At -20 mV, 10 nM cisapride reduced HERG tail-current amplitude by 5%, whereas, at + 20 mV, the tail-current amplitude was reduced by 45% (n = 4 cells). At -20 and + 20 mV, 100 nM cisapride reduced tail-current amplitude by 66 and 90%, respectively. We conclude that cisapride is a potent blocker of HERG channels expressed in HEK293 cells. This effect may account for the clinical occurrence of Q-T prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias observed with cisapride.
23334943	High-grade prostate cancer and biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy among men using 5α-reductase inhibitors and alpha-blockers.	BACKGROUND: Two clinical trials have shown that users of 5α-reductase inhibitors finasteride and dutasteride (5-ARIs) have reduced overall prostate cancer risk, while the proportion of high-grade tumors is increased. We studied tumor characteristics, risk of biochemical recurrence and mortality after radical prostatectomy in 5-ARI and alpha-blocker users. METHODS: The study cohort consisted of 1,315 men who underwent radical prostatectomy at the Tampere University Hospital during 1995-2009. Biochemical relapse was defined as serum PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/ml after the operation. Information on mortality and medication purchases was obtained from national registries. Cox proportional regression was used to analyze hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of biochemical relapse and death. RESULTS: The proportion of high-grade (Gleason 7-10) tumors was significantly elevated among men who had used 5-ARIs for 4 years or longer compared to the non-users (83.3% vs. 53.3%, respectively). Survival curves for biochemical relapse-free survival differed between long-term and short-term 5-ARI users, but the hazard ratio remained statistically non-significant. Risk of biochemical recurrence was elevated among alpha-blocker users (HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.37-2.06), but in sensitivity analyses this was evident only in men using alpha-blockers after prostatectomy. Mortality was not associated with medication usage. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term users of finasteride or dutasteride had more often high-grade prostate cancer. Our results suggest also worse progression-free survival. The association between risk of biochemical recurrence and post-operative alpha-blocker usage suggests that voiding or storage symptoms after prostatectomy may predict biochemical relapse.

23292752	New oral anticoagulants: comparative pharmacology with vitamin K antagonists.	New oral anticoagulants (OACs) that directly inhibit Factor Xa (FXa) or thrombin have been developed for the long-term prevention of thromboembolic disorders. These novel agents provide numerous benefits over older vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) due to major pharmacological differences. VKAs are economical and very well characterized, but have important limitations that can outweigh these advantages, such as slow onset of action, narrow therapeutic window and unpredictable anticoagulant effect. VKA-associated dietary precautions, monitoring and dosing adjustments to maintain international normalized ratio (INR) within therapeutic range, and bridging therapy, are inconvenient for patients, expensive, and may result in inappropriate use of VKA therapy. This may lead to increased bleeding risk or reduced anticoagulation and increased risk of thrombotic events. The new OACs have rapid onset of action, low potential for food and drug interactions, and predictable anticoagulant effect that removes the need for routine monitoring. FXa inhibitors, e.g. rivaroxaban and apixaban, are potent, oral direct inhibitors of prothrombinase-bound, clot-associated or free FXa. Both agents have a rapid onset of action, a wide therapeutic window, little or no interaction with food and other drugs, minimal inter-patient variability, and display similar pharmacokinetics in different patient populations. Since both are substrates, co-administration of rivaroxaban and apixaban with strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and permeability glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors and inducers can result in substantial changes in plasma concentrations due to altered clearance rates; consequently, their concomitant use is contraindicated and caution is required when used concomitantly with strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inducers. Although parenteral oral direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs), such as argatroban and bivalirudin, have been on the market for years, DTIs such as dabigatran are novel synthetic thrombin antagonists. Dabigatran etexilate is a low-molecular-weight non-active pro-drug that is administered orally and converted rapidly to its active form, dabigatran--a potent, competitive and reversible DTI. Dabigatran has an advantage over the indirect thrombin inhibitors, unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin, in that it inhibits free and fibrin-bound thrombin. The reversible binding of dabigatran may provide safer and more predictable anticoagulant treatment than seen with irreversible, non-covalent thrombin inhibitors, e.g. hirudin. Dabigatran shows a very low potential for drug-drug interactions. However, co-administration of dabigatran etexilate with other anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents can increase the bleeding risk. Although the new agents are pharmacologically better than VKAs--particularly in terms of fixed dosing, rapid onset of action, no INR monitoring and lower risk of drug interactions--there are some differences between them: the bioavailability of dabigatran is lower than rivaroxaban and apixaban, and so the dabigatran dosage required is higher; lower protein binding of dabigatran reduces the variability related to albuminaemia. The risk of metabolic drug-drug interactions also appears to differ between OACs: VKAs > rivaroxaban > apixaban > dabigatran. The convenience of the new OACs has translated into improvements in efficacy and safety as shown in phase III randomized trials. The new anticoagulants so far offer the greatest promise and opportunity for the replacement of VKAs.
23044992	Deletion of CD74, a putative MIF receptor, in mice enhances osteoclastogenesis and decreases bone mass.	CD74 is a type II transmembrane protein that can act as a receptor for macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and plays a role in MIF-regulated responses. We reported that MIF inhibited osteoclast formation and MIF knockout (KO) mice had decreased bone mass. We therefore examined if CD74 was involved in the ability of MIF to alter osteoclastogenesis in cultured bone marrow (BM) from wild-type (WT) and CD74-deficient (KO) male mice. We also measured the bone phenotype of CD74 KO male mice. Bone mass in the femur of 8-week-old mice was measured by micro-computed tomography and histomorphometry. Bone marrow cells from CD74 KO mice formed 15% more osteoclast-like cells (OCLs) with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) (both at 30 ng/mL) compared to WT. Addition of MIF to WT cultures inhibited OCL formation by 16% but had no effect on CD74KO cultures. The number of colony forming unit granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) in the bone marrow of CD74 KO mice was 26% greater than in WT controls. Trabecular bone volume (TBV) in the femurs of CD74 KO male mice was decreased by 26% compared to WT. In addition, cortical area and thickness were decreased by 14% and 11%, respectively. Histomorphometric analysis demonstrated that tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)(+) osteoclast number and area were significantly increased in CD74 KO by 35% and 43%, respectively compared to WT. Finally, we examined the effect of MIF on RANKL-induced-signaling pathways in bone marrow macrophage (BMM) cultures. MIF treatment decreased RANKL-induced nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1) and c-Fos protein in BMM cultures by 70% and 41%, respectively. Our data demonstrate that CD74 is required for MIF to affect in vitro osteoclastogenesis. Further, the bone phenotype of CD74 KO mice is similar to that of MIF KO mice. MIF treatment of WT cultures suppressed RANKL-induced activator protein 1 (AP-1) expression, which resulted in decreased osteoclast differentiation in vitro. We propose that CD74 plays a critical role in the MIF inhibition of osteoclastogenesis.
23549331	A Distal Enhancer Controls Cytokine-dependent Human cPLA2α Gene Expression.	Specific control of group IVA cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2α or PLA2G4A) expression modulates arachidonic acid production, thus tightly regulating the downstream effects of pro- and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids. The significance of this pathway in human disease is apparent in a range of pathologies from inflammation to tumorigenesis. While much of the regulation of cPLA2α has focused on post-translational phosphorylation of the protein, studies on transcriptional regulation of this gene have focused only on proximal promoter regions. We have identified a DNase I hypersensitive site encompassing a 5' distal enhancer element containing a highly conserved consensus AP-1 site involved in transcriptional activation of cPLA2α by IL-1β. ChIP, knockdown, knockout and overexpression analyses have shown that c-Jun acts both in a negative and positive regulatory role. Transcriptional activation of cPLA2α occurs through the phosphorylation of c-Jun in conjunction with increased association of C/EBPβ with the distal novel enhancer. The association of C/EBPβ with the transcriptional activation complex does not require an obvious DNA binding site. These data provide new and important contributions to the understanding of cPLA2α regulation at the transcriptional level with implications to eicosanoid metabolism, cellular signaling and disease pathogenesis.
7625729	Drospirenone: a novel progestogen with antimineralocorticoid and antiandrogenic activity.	Drospirenone (ZK 30595; 6 beta, 7 beta, 15 beta, 16 beta-dimethylen-3-oxo-17 alpha-pregn-4-ene-21, 17-carbolactone) is a novel progestogen under clinical development. Drospirenone is characterized by an innovative pharmacodynamic profile which is very closely related to that of progesterone. Potential applications include oral contraception, hormone replacement therapy and treatment of hormonal disorders. The pharmacological properties of drospirenone were investigated in vitro by receptor binding and transactivation experiments and in vivo in appropriate animal models. In qualitative agreement with progesterone, the compound binds strongly to the progesterone and the mineralocorticoid receptor and with lower affinity to androgen and glucocorticoid receptors. There is no detectable binding to the estrogen receptor. Steroid hormone agonistic and antagonistic activities of progesterone and drospirenone were compared in transactivation experiments. Individual steroid hormone receptors were artificially expressed together with a reporter gene in appropriate cell lines. Both hormones were unable to induce any androgen receptor-mediated agonistic activity. Rather, both progesterone and drospirenone distinctly antagonized androgen-stimulated transcriptional activation. Likewise, both compounds only very weakly activated the mineralocorticoid receptor but showed potent aldosterone antagonistic activity. Drospirenone did not induce glucocorticoid receptor-driven transactivation. Progesterone was a weak agonist in this respect. Drospirenone exerts potent progestogenic and antigonadotropic activity which was studied in various animal species. It efficiently promotes the maintenance of pregnancy in ovariectomized rats, inhibits ovulation in rats and mice and stimulates endometrial transformation in the rabbit. Furthermore, drospirenone shows potent antigonadotropic, i.e., testosterone-lowering activity in male cynomolgus monkeys. The progestogenic potency of drospirenone was found to be in the range of that of norethisterone acetate. The majority of clinically used progestogens are androgenic. Drospirenone, like progesterone, has no androgenic but rather an antiandrogenic effect. This property was demonstrated in castrated, testosterone propionate substituted male rats by a dose-dependent inhibition of accessory sex organ growth (seminal vesicles, prostate). In this model, the potency of drospirenone was about a third that of cyproterone acetate. Drospirenone, like progesterone, shows antimineralocorticoid activity, which causes moderately increased sodium and water excretion. This is an outstanding characteristic which has not been described for any other synthetic progestogen before. Drospirenone is eight to ten times more effective in this respect than spironolactone. The natriuretic effect was demonstrable for at least three weeks upon daily treatment of rats with a dose of 10 mg/animal. Drospirenone is devoid of any estrogenic, glucocorticoid or antiglucocorticoid activity. In summary, drospirenone, like progesterone, combines potent progestogenic with antimineralocorticoid and antiandrogenic activity in a similar dose range.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
23349485	Disruption of the cereblon gene enhances hepatic AMPK activity and prevents high fat diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance in mice.	A nonsense mutation in cereblon (CRBN) causes a mild type of mental retardation in humans. An earlier study showed that CRBN negatively regulates the functional activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in vitro by binding directly to the α1 subunit of the AMPK complex. However, the in vivo role of CRBN was not studied. To elucidate the physiological functions of Crbn, a mouse strain was generated in which the Crbn gene was deleted throughout the whole body. In Crbn-deficient mice fed a normal diet, AMPK in the liver showed hyper-phosphorylation, which indicated the constitutive activation of AMPK. Since Crbn-deficient mice showed significantly less weight gain when fed a high fat diet and their insulin sensitivity was considerably improved, the functions of Crbn in the liver were primarily investigated. These results provide the first in vivo evidence that Crbn is a negative modulator of AMPK, which suggests that Crbn may be a potential target for metabolic disorders of the liver.
23363425	Silica precipitation by synthetic minicollagens.	Oligomeric Pro-Hyp-Gly- (POG-) peptides, wherein the collagenous triple helix is supported by C-terminal capping, exhibit silica precipitation properties (O, Hyp = (2S,4R)hydroxyproline). As quantified by a molybdate assay, the length of the covalently tethered triple helix (number of POG units) determines the amount of amorphous silica obtained from silicic acid solution. Although lacking charged side chains, the synthetic collagens precipitate large quantities of silicic acid resulting in micrometer-sized spheres of varying surface morphologies as analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. Similar precipitation efficiencies on a fast time scale of less than 10 min were previously described only for biogenic diatom proteins and sponge collagen, respectively, which have a considerably higher structural complexity and limited accessibility. The minicollagens described here provide an unexpected alternative to the widely used precipitation conditions, which generally depend on (poly-)amines in phosphate buffer. Collagen can form intimate connections with inorganic matter. Hence, silica-enclosed collagens have promising perspectives as composite materials.
10430100	Antitumor activity of ZD1694 (tomudex) against human head and neck cancer in nude mouse models: role of dosing schedule and plasma thymidine.	We studied the antitumor activity and toxicity of ZD1694 (tomudex), a specific inhibitor of thymidylate synthase (TS), in nude mice bearing human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma A253 and FaDu xenografts. Mice were treated by single i.v. push (i.v. x 1), i.v. push once a week for 3 weeks (weekly x 3), and i.v. push once a day for 5 days (daily x 5), and the maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) of ZD1694 were 300 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg/week, and 30 mg/kg/day, respectively. ZD1694 was moderately active against both A253 and FaDu xenografts. Antitumor activity was schedule-dependent in both tumors: weekly x 3 > or = i.v. x 1 >> daily x 5. In contrast, the rank order of toxicity was daily x 5 >> weekly x 3 > or = i.v. x 1. ZD1694 at the MTD produced 20% complete tumor regression and 20% partial tumor regression (PR) with i.v. x 1 and weekly x 3 schedules and 12-day tumor growth delay with daily x 5 schedule against FaDu xenografts. No complete tumor regression was achieved with ZD1694 with any schedule against A253; a 20% PR, 40% PR, and 10-day tumor growth delay were observed with i.v. x 1, weekly x 3, and daily x 5 schedules, respectively. The data indicate that ZD1694 was slightly more effective against FaDu than against A253. Of interest and potential clinical importance was the observation that ZD1694 was still active at doses lower than the MTD (> or =1/3 MTD), which showed a high therapeutic index and wide safety margin. Study of ZD1694 compared with 5-fluorouracil and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine at the MTD revealed that the antitumor activity of ZD1694 was comparable with or superior to 5-fluorouracil and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine against both A253 and FaDu xenografts, with less toxicity. High plasma thymidine in mouse relative to human (approximately 1.3 microM and <0.1 microM, respectively) may complicate the study of antitumor activity and toxicity of TS inhibitors with human tumor xenografts grown in the mouse. To test this hypothesis, we preadministered methoxypolyethyleneglycol-conjugated thymidine phosphorylase (MPEG-TPase; 2500 units/kg/dose) to reduce mouse plasma thymidine, then treated with various doses of ZD1694 using the daily x 5 or i.v. x 1 schedules in the A253 tumor model. MPEG-TPase significantly increased the toxicity of ZD1694; the MTD of ZD1694 plus MPEG-TPase was reduced 3- and 10-fold compared with ZD1694 alone for i.v x 1 and daily x 5 schedules, respectively. However, preadministration of MPEG-TPase did not potentiate the antitumor activity of ZD1694 with either schedule. The data indicate that the study of TS inhibitors in rodent models may not be suitable for predicting a safe dose for clinical study. However, rodent models, particularly human tumor xenografts, are still useful models for evaluation of antitumor activity and schedule selection for TS inhibitors.
23360412	Bioactivation of the nasal toxicant 2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile: an assessment of metabolic activity in human nasal mucosa and identification of indicators of exposure and potential toxicity.	The herbicide 2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile (DCBN) is a potent nasal toxicant in rodents; however, it is not known whether DCBN causes similar nasal toxicity in humans. The tissue-selective toxicity of DCBN in mouse nasal mucosa is largely dependent on target tissue bioactivation by CYP2A5. The human orthologues of CYP2A5, CYP2A6 and CYP2A13, are both expressed in nasal mucosa and are capable of activating DCBN. In this study, we directly determined the ability of human nasal mucosa to bioactivate DCBN. We also tested the suitability of a glutathione conjugate of DCBN (GS-DCBN) or its derivatives as biomarkers of DCBN exposure and nasal toxicity in mouse models. We found that human fetal nasal mucosa microsomes catalyze the formation of GS-DCBN, with a Km value comparable to that of adult mouse nasal mucosa microsomes. The activity of the human nasal mucosa microsomes was inhibited by 8-methoxypsoralen, a known CYP2A inhibitor. GS-DCBN and its metabolites were detected in the nasal mucosa and nasal-wash fluid obtained from DCBN-treated mice, in amounts that increased with escalations in DCBN dose, and they were all still detectable at 24 h after a DCBN treatment (at 10 mg/kg). Further studies in Cyp2a5-null mice indicated that GS-DCBN and its metabolites in nasal-wash fluid were generated in the nasal mucosa, rather than in other organs. Thus, our data indicate for the first time that the human nasal mucosa is capable of bioactivating DCBN and that GS-DCBN and its metabolites in nasal-wash fluid may collectively serve as indicators of DCBN exposure and potential nasal toxicity in humans.
23569204	Structural and functional characterization of a phosphatase domain within yeast general transcription factor TFIIIC.	Saccharomyces cerevisiae τ55, a subunit of the RNA polymerase III-specific general transcription factor TFIIIC, comprises an N-terminal histidine phosphatase domain (τ55-HPD) whose catalytic activity and cellular function is poorly understood. We solved the crystal structures of τ55-HPD and its closely related paralogue Huf and used in silico docking methods to identify phospho-serine and phospho-tyrosine containing peptides as possible substrates that were subsequently validated using in vitro phosphatase assays. A comparative phospho-proteomic study identified additional phosphopeptides as possible targets, which show the involvement of these two phosphatases in the regulation of a variety of cellular functions. Our results identify τ55-HPD and Huf as bona fide protein phosphatases, characterize their substrate specificities and provide a small set of regulated phosphosite targets in vivo.
23470287	A newly synthesized sinapic Acid derivative inhibits endothelial activation in vitro and in vivo.	Inhibition of oxidative stress and inflammation in vascular endothelial cells (ECs) may represent a new therapeutic strategy against endothelial activation. Sinapic acid (SA), a phenylpropanoid compound, is found in natural herbs and high-bran cereals and has moderate antioxidant activity. We aimed to develop new SA agents with the properties of antioxidation and blocking EC activation for possible therapy of cardiovascular disease. We designed and synthesized 10 SA derivatives according to their chemical structures. Preliminary screening of the compounds involved scavenging hydroxyl radicals and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH(⋅)), croton oil-induced ear edema in mice, and analysis of the mRNA expression of adhesion molecules in ECs. 1-Acetyl-sinapic acyl-4-(3'-chlorine-)benzylpiperazine (SA9) had the strongest antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, the effect of SA9 was further studied. SA9 inhibited tumor necrosis factor α-induced upregulation of adhesion molecules in ECs at both mRNA and protein levels, as well as the consequent monocyte adhesion to ECs. In vivo, result of face-to-face immunostaining showed that SA9 reduced lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in mouse aortic intima. To study the molecular mechanism, results from luciferase assay, nuclear translocation of NF-κB, and Western blot indicated that the mechanism of the anti-inflammatory effects of SA9 might be suppression of intracellular generation of ROS and inhibition of NF-κB activation in ECs. SA9 is a prototype of a novel class of antioxidant with anti-inflammatory effects in ECs. It may represent a new therapeutic approach for preventing endothelial activation in cardiovascular disorders.
17089011	DNA topoisomerase IIalpha (TOP2A) inhibitors up-regulate fatty acid synthase gene expression in SK-Br3 breast cancer cells: in vitro evidence for a 'functional amplicon' involving FAS, Her-2/neu and TOP2A genes.	Fatty acid synthase (FAS), the key metabolic multi-enzyme that is responsible for the terminal catalytic step in the de novo fatty acid biosynthesis, plays an active role in the development, maintenance, and enhancement of the malignant phenotype in a subset of breast carcinomas. We recently described that a molecular bi-directional cross-talk between FAS and the Her-2/neu (erbB-2) oncogene is taking place at the level of transcription, translation, and activity in breast cancer cells. Because Her-2/neu has been linked with altered sensitivity to cytotoxic drugs, we envisioned that FAS gene expression may represent a novel predictive molecular factor for breast cancer response to chemotherapy in a Her-2/neu-related manner. We herein evaluated whether chemotherapy-induced cell damage acts in an epigenetic fashion by inducing changes in the transcriptional activation of FAS gene in breast cancer cells. To evaluate this option, FAS- and Her-2/neu-overexpressing SK-Br3 breast cancer cells were transiently transfected with a FAS promoter-reporter construct (FAS-Luciferase) harboring all the elements necessary for high level expression in cancer cells. SK-Br3 cells cultured in the presence of topoisomerase IIalpha (TOP2A) inhibitors doxorubicin and etopoxide (VP-16) demonstrated a 2- to 3-fold increase in FAS promoter activity when compared with control cells growing in drug-free culture conditions. We failed to observe any significant activation of FAS promoter following exposure to the anti-metabolite 5-fluorouracil, the alkylating drug cisplatin, or the microtubule interfering-agents paclitaxel and vincristine. Moreover, the up-regulatory effects of TOP2A inhibitors on the transcriptional activation of FAS gene expression were not significantly decreased when the FAS promoter was damaged at the sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-binding site. Considering that FAS inhibition produces profound inhibition of DNA replication and S-phase progression in cancer cells, we finally asked whether a cross-talk between TOP2A and FAS could exhibit a Her-2/neu-related bi-directional nature. TOP2A protein levels were decreased during treatment with the anti-Her-2/neu antibody trastuzumab while, concomitantly, FAS promoter activity and FAS protein expression were significantly reduced. Of note, when the expression levels of TOP2A protein were analyzed following exposure of SK-Br3 cells to increasing concentrations of the novel slow-binding FAS inhibitor C75, a dose-dependent reduction in TOP2A expression was observed. Although FAS gene is not physically located in the Her-2/neu-TOP2A amplicon, our present findings strongly suggest that a tight functional association between FAS, Her-2/neu and TOP2A genes is taking place in a subset of breast carcinoma cells.
17408310	Application of the bradford hill criteria to assess the causality of cisapride-induced arrhythmia: a model for assessing causal association in pharmacovigilance.	INTRODUCTION: The Bradford Hill criteria are a widely used, useful tool for the assessment of biomedical causation. We have examined their application to pharmacovigilance using the example of cisapride-induced QTc interval prolongation/arrhythmia. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Reactions Weekly and regulatory websites to identify evidence for the association between cisapride and QTc interval prolongation/arrhythmia that had been published in the English language. Two hundred and five publications were identified as being potentially suitable for the study. After excluding irrelevant articles, studies on high-risk populations and review articles, 70 publications were assessed using the Bradford Hill criteria. These included 24 case reports, case series or spontaneous report summaries; eight epidemiological studies; 22 clinical studies; and 16 experimental (in vivo and in vitro) publications. RESULTS: The most compelling evidence for an association between cisapride use and QTc interval prolongation/arrhythmia came from case/spontaneous reports and biological plausibility. Considering the rare incidence of serious cardiac events, these criteria formed the basis for the strength of the association. The number of reports from different populations showed consistency. Specificity was supported by clinical and cardiographic characterisation of the events. There were temporal relationships between the events and the initiation of cisapride treatment, increases in the dosage and the receipt of interacting medications. The relationships between the adverse events and the latter two factors exhibited biological gradients. Experimental evidence could be found from biological models, as well as reports of positive dechallenge and/or rechallenge found in individual patients. Cisapride was found to bind the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) potassium channel, which provides a plausible mechanism for QTc interval prolongation/arrhythmia. Other QTc interval-prolonging/arrhythmic drugs that also bind to HERG provided an analogy for cisapride causing QTc interval prolongation/arrhythmia via this mechanism. The evidence provided by clinical studies was inconsistent, and epidemiological studies failed to demonstrate an association. Nevertheless, this did not prevent the assessment of causation. DISCUSSION: This study showed how different types of evidence found in pharmacovigilance can be evaluated using the Bradford Hill criteria. Further work is required to examine how the criteria can be applied to different types of adverse events and how they may be applied to pharmacovigilance.
16876126	RNA interference-triggered reversal of ABCC2-dependent cisplatin resistance in human cancer cells.	The adenosine triphosphate binding cassette (ABC)-transporter ABCC2 (MRP2/cMOAT) can mediate resistance against the commonly used anticancer drugs cisplatin and paclitaxel. To overcome the ABCC2-depending drug resistance, two specific anti-ABCC2 small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were designed for transient triggering of the gene-silencing RNA interference (RNAi) pathway in the cisplatin-resistant human ovarian carcinoma cell line A2780RCIS. Since both siRNAs showed biological activity, for stable inhibition of ABCC2 a corresponding short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-encoding expression vector was designed. By treatment of A2780RCIS cells with this construct, the expressions of the targeted ABCC2 encoding mRNA and transport protein were inhibited. These effects were accompanied by reversal of resistance against cisplatin and paclitaxel. Thus, the data demonstrate the utility of the analyzed RNAs as powerful laboratory tools and indicate that siRNA- and shRNA-mediated RNAi-based gene therapeutic approaches may be applicable in preventing and reversing ABCC2-depending drug resistance.
6433001	Effects of metal cations and calmodulin antagonists on [3H] nitrendipine binding in smooth and cardiac muscle.	It was previously reported that [3H]nitrendipine binding to a microsomal fraction from intestinal smooth muscle was dependent upon the presence of divalent metal cations (Bolger et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 225: 291-309, 1983). The effects of cations and calmodulin antagonists on [3H]nitrendipine binding in smooth and cardiac muscle have been studied further. Treatment of ileal and aortic smooth muscle and cardiac muscle with EDTA reduced specific [3H]nitrendipine binding by 70 to 95%. Microsomes from rabbit ventricle were more resistant to EDTA treatment than were those from ileal smooth muscle, but low concentrations of Ca++ (less than 10(-5) M) produced half-maximal restoration of binding in both tissues. The ability of cations at a concentration of 10(-3) M to restore binding to membranes from guinea-pig ileum was in the sequence, Ca++ = Sr++ greater than Mg++ = Mn++ = Co++ greater than Ba++ = Ni++ greater than Zn++ = Cd++ greater than La = Sm = Tm . In contrast to the activation of calmodulin-dependent processes, the ability of these cations to restore [3H]nitrendipine binding did not correlate linearly with ionic radius. However, calmodulin antagonists were found to inhibit [3H]nitrendipine binding with the order of potency: pimozide greater than less than calmidazolium (R 24571) greater than trifluoperazine greater than chlorpromazine greater than promethazine greater than chlorpromazine sulfoxide, that correlates quite well with the potency of these drugs as inhibitors of calmodulin-dependent processes. The results suggest that calmodulin antagonists bind to a protein associated with the [3H]nitrendipine binding site that has a hydrophobic domain similar to that exposed on calmodulin by Ca++, but that this protein is not calmodulin itself.
16981227	Effects of DRD2 and CYP2D6 genotypes on delta EEG power response to aripiprazole in healthy male volunteers: a preliminary study.	The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of polymorphisms in dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 genes on delta EEG power response to aripiprazole in healthy male volunteers. Seventeen volunteers were recruited according to the DRD2 Taq1A genotype, and separated into the following groups: homozygous wild-type (A2/A2, n = 7), heterozygous (A2/A1, n = 5) and homozygous variant-type (A1/A1, n = 5) groups. After enrollment in this study, they were genotyped for CYP2D6. The volunteers received single 10 mg oral doses of aripiprazole, in accordance with an open-label parallel group study design. Plasma levels of aripiprazole and its metabolite were determined and EEGs were obtained simultaneously. The pharmacodynamic parameter was absolute delta power in the Cz channel. The changes of delta power were not different according to DRD2 Taq1A genotypes. As to the CYP2D6 allele, the subjects had the following CYP2D6 genotypes: *10/*10 (n = 4), *1/*10 (n = 5), *1/*5 (n = 2), *1/*1 (n = 3), *2/*41 (n = 1), *2/*2 (n = 1), *2N/*10 (n = 1). Subjects exhibiting the *1/*5 and *1/*10 genotypes showed a trend toward high area under the plasma aripiprazole concentration-time curve (AUC), which was linearly related to area under the EEG response-time curve (AUEC). Our results demonstrate a need for further evaluation of the CYP2D6 genotypic effect on the pharmacodynamics of aripiprazole.
23192350	Silencing α1,3-fucosyltransferases in human leukocytes reveals a role for FUT9 enzyme during E-selectin-mediated cell adhesion.	Leukocyte adhesion during inflammation is initiated by the binding of sialofucosylated carbohydrates expressed on leukocytes to endothelial E/P-selectin. Although the glycosyltransferases (glycoTs) constructing selectin-ligands have largely been identified using knock-out mice, important differences may exist between humans and mice. To address this, we developed a systematic lentivirus-based shRNA delivery workflow to create human leukocytic HL-60 cell lines that lack up to three glycoTs. Using this, the contributions of all three myeloid α1,3-fucosyltransferases (FUT4, FUT7, and FUT9) to selectin-ligand biosynthesis were evaluated. The cell adhesion properties of these modified cells to L-, E-, and P-selectin under hydrodynamic shear were compared with bone marrow-derived neutrophils from Fut4(-/-)Fut7(-/-) dual knock-out mice. Results demonstrate that predominantly FUT7, and to a lesser extent FUT4, forms the selectin-ligand at the N terminus of leukocyte P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) in humans and mice. Here, 85% reduction in leukocyte interaction was observed in human FUT4(-)7(-) dual knockdowns on P/L-selectin substrates. Unlike Fut4(-/-)Fut7(-/-) mouse neutrophils, however, human knockdowns lacking FUT4 and FUT7 only exhibited partial reduction in rolling interaction on E-selectin. In this case, the third α1,3-fucosyltransferase FUT9 played an important role because leukocyte adhesion was reduced by 50-60% in FUT9-HL-60, 70-80% in dual knockdown FUT7(-)9(-) cells, and ∼85% in FUT4(-)7(-)9(-) triple knockdowns. Gene silencing results are in agreement with gain-of-function experiments where all three fucosyltransferases conferred E-selectin-mediated rolling in HEK293T cells. This study advances new tools to study human glycoT function. It suggests a species-specific role for FUT9 during the biosynthesis of human E-selectin ligands.
23117207	The S349T mutation of SQSTM1 links Keap1/Nrf2 signalling to Paget's disease of bone.	Mutations affecting the Sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1) gene commonly occur in patients with the skeletal disorder Paget's disease of bone (PDB), a condition characterised by defective osteoclast differentiation and function. Whilst most mutations cluster within the ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain of the SQSTM1 protein, and are associated with dysregulated NFκB signalling, several non-UBA domain mutations have also been identified. Keap1 is a SQSTM1-interacting protein that regulates the levels and activity of the Nrf2 transcription factor. This in turn controls the expression of numerous cytoprotective genes that contribute to the cell's capacity to defend itself against chemical and oxidative stress, through binding to the antioxidant response element (ARE). The PDB-associated S349T mutation maps to the Keap1-interacting region (KIR) of SQSTM1, however the effects of PDB mutant SQSTM1 on Keap1 function have not been investigated. Here we show that unlike other SQSTM1 mutations, the S349T mutation results in neither impaired ubiquitin-binding function in pull-down assays, nor dysregulated NFκB signalling in luciferase reporter assays. Keap1 is expressed in differentiating osteoclast-like cells and the S349T mutation selectively impairs the SQSTM1-Keap1 interaction in co-immunoprecipitations, which molecular modelling indicates results from effects on critical hydrogen bonds required to stabilise the KIR-Keap1 complex. Further, S349T mutant SQSTM1, but not other PDB-associated mutants, showed reduced ability to activate Nrf2 signalling as assessed by ARE-luciferase reporter assays. Thus, SQSTM1-mediated dysregulation of the Keap1-Nrf2 axis, which could potentially lead to aberrant production of oxidative response genes, may contribute to disease aetiology in a subset of PDB patients.
23526814	tert-Butylcarbamate-Containing Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors: Apoptosis Induction, Cytodifferentiation, and Antiproliferative Activities in Cancer Cells.	Herein we report novel pyrrole- and benzene-based hydroxamates (8, 10) and 2'-aminoanilides (9, 11) bearing the tert-butylcarbamate group at the CAP moiety as histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. Compounds 8 b and 10 c selectively inhibited HDAC6 at the nanomolar level, whereas the other hydroxamates effected an increase in acetyl-α-tubulin levels in human acute myeloid leukemia U937 cells. In the same cell line, compounds 8 b and 10 c elicited 18.4 and 21.4 % apoptosis, respectively (SAHA: 16.9 %), and the pyrrole anilide 9 c displayed the highest cytodifferentiating effect (90.9 %). In tests against a wide range of various cancer cell lines to determine its antiproliferative effects, compound 10 c exhibited growth inhibition from sub-micromolar (neuroblastoma LAN-5 and SH-SY5Y cells, chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells) to low-micromolar (lung H1299 and A549, colon HCT116 and HT29 cancer cells) concentrations. In HT29 cells, 10 c increased histone H3 acetylation, and decreased the colony-forming potential of the cancer cells by up to 60 %.
15240758	Electrophysiological properties of mouse horizontal cell GABAA receptors.	GABA-induced currents have been characterized in isolated horizontal cells from lower vertebrates but not in mammalian horizontal cells. Therefore horizontal cells were isolated after enzymatical and mechanical dissociation of the adult mouse retina and visually identified. We recorded from horizontal cell bodies using the whole cell and outside-out configuration of the patch-clamp technique. Extracellular application of GABA induced inward currents carried by chloride ions. GABA-evoked currents were completely and reversibly blocked by the competitive GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline (IC50 = 1.7 microM), indicating expression of GABAA but not GABAC receptors. Their affinity for GABA was moderate (EC50 = 30 microM), and the Hill coefficient was 1.3, corresponding to two GABA binding sites. GABA responses were partially reduced by picrotoxin with differential effects on peak and steady-state current values. Zinc blocked the GABA response with an IC50 value of 7.3 microM in a noncompetitive manner. Furthermore, GABA receptors of horizontal cells were modulated by extracellular application of diazepam, zolpidem, methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboxylate, pentobarbital, and alphaxalone, thus showing typical pharmacological properties of CNS GABAA receptors. GABA-evoked single-channel currents were characterized by a main conductance state of 29.8 pS and two subconductance states (20.2 and 10.8 pS, respectively). Kinetic analysis of single-channel events within bursts revealed similar mean open and closed times for the main conductance and the 20.2-pS subconductance state, resulting in open probabilities of 44.6 and 42.7%, respectively. The ratio of open to closed times, however, was significantly different for the 10.8-pS subconductance state with an open probability of 57.2%.
2751392	Developmental changes in lactate dehydrogenase-X activity in young jaundiced male rats.	This study was designed to examine the testicular maturation in both jaundiced (jj) and nonjaundiced (Jj) male Gunn rats as indicated by the activity of a testis and sperm-specific enzyme, lactate dehydrogenase-X (LDH-X), and serum testosterone levels. Testicular cytosolic LDH-X activity was determined by oxidation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). Serum testosterone levels were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Testicular LDH-X activity increased rapidly between 30 and 50 days of age in both Jj and jj Gunn rats. LDH-X activity was significantly lower in the jj Gunn rats at 50 and 60 days of age. Testosterone level was significantly lower in the jj Gunn rats at 50 days of age. LDH-X activity and serum testosterone levels were similar for both genotypes at 180 days of age. The delay of testicular maturation in the jaundiced males seems to be due to lower LDH-X activity and serum testosterone levels.
16538493	Thymidylate synthase expression in resectable and unresectable pancreatic cancer: role as predictive or prognostic marker?	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Thymidylate synthase (TS) is an important enzyme for DNA synthesis and the target for 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Its expression may determine the outcome of patients with gastrointestinal cancers. We examined the prognostic and predictive value of TS-protein expression in patients with ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. METHODS: TS expression from 131 patients with ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded primary tumour specimens or biopsies. RESULTS: The median disease-specific survival among all patients (n=131) was 13 months. The invasion depth, the presence of metastases, grading and Union Internationale Contre le Cancer [International Union Against Cancer] (UICC) stage were associated with survival. Among resected patients (n=98), a difference in median survival was seen in the group receiving postoperative adjuvant treatment (21.1 months) compared with the group treated by surgery alone (12.4 months) (p=0.025). Low- and high-TS immunoreactivity was present in 74 (56%) and 56 (43%) of the cancers, respectively. One sample was not evaluable. No difference in median survival was observed among low- and high-TS-expressing tumours. Among patients undergoing resection and receiving postoperative intra-arterial chemotherapy (n=23), a marked trend to a longer median survival was seen for the group with low-TS-expressing tumours compared with the corresponding high-TS group (25.0 vs 16.0 months) (p=0.3834). There was no difference in survival among all palliative treated patients with low- and high-TS-expressing tumours. CONCLUSION: Especially patients undergoing tumour resection with low-TS values seemed to have taken advantage from an intensified postoperative chemotherapeutic protocol. However due to the heterogeneous group of patients in the present report, larger trials of more homogenous patient populations will be necessary to confirm this hypothesis.
15500910	Unique kinetic mechanism of Plasmodium falciparum adenylosuccinate synthetase.	Adenylosuccinate synthetase (AdSS) catalyses the Mg(2+) dependent formation of adenylosuccinate from IMP and aspartate, the reaction being driven by the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. All characterized AdSS thus far exhibit a random kinetic mechanism. We present here kinetic evidence that unlike all other AdSS, Plasmodium falciparum AdSS (PfAdSS) has ordered substrate binding. Inhibition studies show that binding of GTP requires IMP binding while aspartate binds to the enzyme-IMP-GTP complex. A structural basis for this difference in mechanism is presented. Kinetically, PfAdSS is closer to the mouse acidic isozyme rather than to the mouse basic isozyme. The mouse acidic isozyme is thought to play a role in the purine nucleotide biosynthetic pathway. Regulation of PfAdSS in vivo can therefore, be expected to be similar to the mouse acidic isozyme, in agreement with the role of PfAdSS as the only pathway for the synthesis of adenine nucleotides in the parasite. However, PfAdSS differs from both the mammalian homologs in that fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, a potent inhibitor of the mammalian enzyme, is an activator of PfAdSS. The differences highlighted here are promising in terms of species-specific drug design, targeting this essential enzyme in the parasite.
23178198	Etazolate, an α-secretase activator, reduces neuroinflammation and offers persistent neuroprotection following traumatic brain injury in mice.	Traumatic brain injury (TBI) evokes an intense neuroinflammatory reaction that is essentially mediated by activated microglia and that has been reported to act as a secondary injury mechanism that further promotes neuronal death. It involves the excessive production of inflammatory cytokines and the diminution of neuroprotective and neurotrophic factors, such as the soluble form alpha of the amyloid precursor protein (sAPPα), generated by the activity of α-secretases. Hence, the aim of this study was to examine the effects of etazolate, an α-secretase activator, on acute and belated post-TBI consequences. The mouse model of TBI by mechanical percussion was used and injured mice received either the vehicle or etazolate at the dose of 1, 3 or 10 mg/kg at 2 h post-TBI. Neurological score, cerebral œdema, IL-1β and sAPPα levels, microglial activation and lesion size were evaluated from 6 to 24 h post-TBI. Spontaneous locomotor activity was evaluated from 48 h to 12 weeks post-TBI, memory function at 5 weeks and olfactory bulb lesions at 13 weeks post-TBI. A single administration of etazolate exerted a dose-dependent anti-inflammatory and anti-œdematous effect accompanied by lasting memory improvement, reduction of locomotor hyperactivity and olfactory bulb tissue protection, with a therapeutic window of at least 2 h. These effects were associated with the restoration of the levels of the sAPPα protein post-TBI. Taken together, these results highlight for the first time the therapeutic interest of an α-secretase activator in TBI.
10847421	Dose-dependent release of endogenous tissue factor pathway inhibitor by different low molecular weight heparins.	Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) is released to circulating blood after intravenous and subcutaneous injections of heparins, and may thus contribute to the antithrombotic effect of heparins. A previous study suggested different abilities of various low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) to release endogenous TFPI, but the dose-response relationship was not determined. In the present study, the dose-response relationship for escalating doses of two LMWHs, dalteparin and enoxaparin, on the release of endogenous TFPI was investigated. Six healthy male participants were given 50, 100 and 200 U/kg dalteparin and 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg enoxaparin as a single subcutaneous injection. The study was a randomized, cross-over design with a 1-week wash-out period between each injection. Peak free TFPI antigen and TFPI activity were detected after only 1 h, whereas anti-activated factor X (anti-FXa) and anti-activated factor II (anti-FIIa) activities were detected after 2-6 h. Putative therapeutic equivalent doses of dalteparin and enoxaparin gave similar release of endogenous TFPI, but dissimilar effects on anti-FXa and anti-FIIa activities.
23609438	The Intermediate-conductance Calcium-activated Potassium Channel KCa3.1 Regulates Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell Proliferation via Controlling Calcium-dependent Signaling.	The intermediate-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel KCa3.1 contributes to a variety of cell activation processes in pathologies such as inflammation, carcinogenesis and vascular remodeling. We examined the electrophysiological and transcriptional mechanisms by which KCa3.1 regulates vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation. Platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF)-induced proliferation of human coronary artery VSMCs was attenuated by lowering intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) and was enhanced by elevating [Ca(2+)]i. KCa3.1 blockade or knockdown inhibited proliferation by suppressing the rise in [Ca(2+)]i and attenuating the expression of phosphorylated cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), c-fos and neuron-derived orphan receptor-1 (NOR-1). This anti-proliferative effect was abolished by elevating [Ca(2+)]i. KCa3.1 overexpression induced VSMC proliferation, and potentiated PDGF-induced proliferation, by inducing CREB phosphorylation, c-fos and NOR-1. Pharmacological stimulation of KCa3.1 unexpectedly suppressed proliferation by inhibiting the rise in [Ca(2+)]i and abolishing the expression and activity of KCa3.1 and PDGF β-receptors. The stimulation also attenuated the levels of phosphorylated CREB, c-fos and cyclins expression. After KCa3.1 blockade, the characteristic round shape of VSMCs expressing high l-caldesmon and low calponin-1 (dedifferentiation state) was maintained, whereas KCa3.1 stimulation induced a spindle-shape cellular appearance, with low l-caldesmon and high calponin-1. In conclusion, KCa3.1 plays an important role in VSMC proliferation via controlling Ca(2+)-dependent signaling pathways and its modulation may therefore constitute a new therapeutic target for cell proliferative diseases such as atherosclerosis.
23434193	The role of omega-3 derived resolvins in arthritis.	Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are known to alleviate joint stiffness and pain in rheumatoid arthritis patients. However, the mechanisms by which omega-3s exert their beneficial effects has not been fully explored. Herein we discuss a novel class of bioactive lipid mediators, which are enzymatically biosynthesized in vivo from omega-3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), termed resolvins. These lipid mediators exert anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving properties and are log-orders more potent than their precursors. We also highlight that formation of pro-resolving mediators can be enhanced by widely used anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective drugs (aspirin and statins) via the modification of cyclooxygenase-2 enzymatic activity. These bioactive pro-resolving lipid mediators provide further rationale for the beneficial effects of dietary supplementation with fish oils, and offer new avenues for developing therapeutics for inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis.
14530799	The neuropharmacological basis for the use of memantine in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.	"Memantine has been demonstrated to be safe and effective in the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). While the neurobiological basis for the therapeutic activity of memantine is not fully understood, the drug is not a cholinesterase inhibitor and, therefore, acts differently from current AD therapies. Memantine can interact with a variety of ligand-gated ion channels. However, NMDA receptors appear to be a key target of memantine at therapeutic concentrations. Memantine is an uncompetitive (channel blocking) NMDA receptor antagonist. Like other NMDA receptor antagonists, memantine at high concentrations can inhibit mechanisms of synaptic plasticity that are believed to underlie learning and memory. However, at lower, clinically relevant concentrations memantine can under some circumstances promote synaptic plasticity and preserve or enhance memory in animal models of AD. In addition, memantine can protect against the excitotoxic destruction of cholinergic neurons. Blockade of NMDA receptors by memantine could theoretically confer disease-modifying activity in AD by inhibiting the ""weak"" NMDA receptor-dependent excitotoxicity that has been hypothesized to play a role in the progressive neuronal loss that underlies the evolving dementia. Moreover, recent in vitro studies suggest that memantine abrogates beta-amyloid (Abeta) toxicity and possibly inhibits Abeta production. Considerable attention has focused on the investigation of theories to explain the better tolerability of memantine over other NMDA receptor antagonists, particularly those that act by a similar channel blocking mechanism such as dissociative anesthetic-like agents (phencyclidine, ketamine, MK-801). A variety of channel-level factors could be relevant, including fast channel-blocking kinetics and strong voltage-dependence (allowing rapid relief of block during synaptic activity), as well as reduced trapping (permitting egress from closed channels). These factors may allow memantine to block channel activity induced by low, tonic levels of glutamate--an action that might contribute to symptomatic improvement and could theoretically protect against weak excitotoxicity--while sparing synaptic responses required for normal behavioral functioning, cognition and memory."
12431845	Atomoxetine increases extracellular levels of norepinephrine and dopamine in prefrontal cortex of rat: a potential mechanism for efficacy in attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.	The selective norepinephrine (NE) transporter inhibitor atomoxetine (formerly called tomoxetine or LY139603) has been shown to alleviate symptoms in Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). We investigated the mechanism of action of atomoxetine in ADHD by evaluating the interaction of atomoxetine with monoamine transporters, the effects on extracellular levels of monoamines, and the expression of the neuronal activity marker Fos in brain regions. Atomoxetine inhibited binding of radioligands to clonal cell lines transfected with human NE, serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) transporters with dissociation constants (K(i)) values of 5, 77 and 1451 nM, respectively, demonstrating selectivity for NE transporters. In microdialysis studies, atomoxetine increased extracellular (EX) levels of NE in prefrontal cortex (PFC) 3-fold, but did not alter 5-HT(EX) levels. Atomoxetine also increased DA(EX) concentrations in PFC 3-fold, but did not alter DA(EX) in striatum or nucleus accumbens. In contrast, the psychostimulant methylphenidate, which is used in ADHD therapy, increased NE(EX) and DA(EX) equally in PFC, but also increased DA(EX) in the striatum and nucleus accumbens to the same level. The expression of the neuronal activity marker Fos was increased 3.7-fold in PFC by atomoxetine administration, but was not increased in the striatum or nucleus accumbens, consistent with the regional distribution of increased DA(EX). We hypothesize that the atomoxetine-induced increase of catecholamines in PFC, a region involved in attention and memory, mediates the therapeutic effects of atomoxetine in ADHD. In contrast to methylphenidate, atomoxetine did not increase DA in striatum or nucleus accumbens, suggesting it would not have motoric or drug abuse liabilities.
16855093	The glutamate-aspartate transporter GLAST mediates glutamate uptake at inner hair cell afferent synapses in the mammalian cochlea.	Ribbon synapses formed between inner hair cells (IHCs) and afferent dendrites in the mammalian cochlea can sustain high rates of release, placing strong demands on glutamate clearance mechanisms. To investigate the role of transporters in glutamate removal at these synapses, we made whole-cell recordings from IHCs, afferent dendrites, and glial cells adjacent to IHCs [inner phalangeal cells (IPCs)] in whole-mount preparations of rat organ of Corti. Focal application of the transporter substrate D-aspartate elicited inward currents in IPCs, which were larger in the presence of anions that permeate the transporter-associated anion channel and blocked by the transporter antagonist D,L-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartate. These currents were produced by glutamate-aspartate transporters (GLAST) (excitatory amino acid transporter 1) because they were weakly inhibited by dihydrokainate, an antagonist of glutamate transporter-1 (excitatory amino acid transporter 2) and were absent from IPCs in GLAST-/- cochleas. Furthermore, D-aspartate-induced currents in outside-out patches from IPCs exhibited larger steady-state currents than responses elicited by L-glutamate, a prominent feature of GLAST, and examination of cochlea from GLAST-Discosoma red (DsRed) promoter reporter mice revealed that DsRed expression was restricted to IPCs and other supporting cells surrounding IHCs. Saturation of transporters by photolysis of caged D-aspartate failed to elicit transporter currents in IHCs, as did local application of D-aspartate to afferent terminals, indicating that neither presynaptic nor postsynaptic membranes are major sites for glutamate removal. These data indicate that GLAST in supporting cells is responsible for transmitter uptake at IHC afferent synapses.
2865685	Beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor binding and functional response in right and left atria of rat heart.	The properties of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors in right and left atria of rat heart, and their roles in mediating chronotropic and inotropic responses to beta-adrenoceptor agonists were examined. [125I](-)pindolol (125IPIN) bound saturably and specifically to a single class of high affinity sites in homogenates of both right and left atria. The k1's for association in right and left atria were 6.5 X 10(9) l/mol-min and 2.3 X 10(9) l/mol-min respectively, while the k-1's for dissociation were 0.20 min-1 and 0.17 min-1. The kinetically determined KD's were 75 pmol/l in right and 30 pmol/l in left atria and were similar to the equilibrium KD's determined from Scatchard analysis of saturation isotherms of specific 125IPIN binding. Inhibition of 125IPIN binding by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists was stereoselective and the order of potency was timolol greater than l-propranolol greater than d-propranolol greater than sotalol. Inhibition by beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor subtype selective antagonists yielded flat displacement curves with low Hill coefficients. Nonlinear regression analysis of displacement by beta 1-selective (practolol, atenolol and metoprolol) and beta 2-selective (ICI 118,551) antagonists gave estimates of the proportion of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors present in rat atria. Right atria contained 67 +/- 4.2% beta 1- and 33 +/- 4.2% beta 2-adrenoceptors, while left atria contained 67 +/- 2.8% beta 1- and 33 +/- 2.8% beta 2-adrenoceptors. Increases in the rate of spontaneously beating right atria and the force of electrically driven left atria caused by beta-adrenoceptor agonists were also measured. pA2 values for non-subtype selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in inhibiting isoprenaline-induced increases in rate and force were highly correlated with KD values determined for specific 125IPIN binding. pA2 values for beta 1- and beta 2-selective antagonists in inhibiting isoprenaline-induced increases in rate and force correlated well with the pKD values of these drugs in binding to beta 1-adrenoceptors, but not with the pKD values in binding to beta 2-adrenoceptors. Dose-response curves for stimulation of both rate and force by the beta 2-selective agonists procaterol and zinterol were shifted to a much greater extent by selective blockade of beta 1-adrenoceptors with metoprolol than by selective blockade of beta 2-adrenoceptors with ICI 118,551, suggesting that these compounds caused their effects by activating beta 1-adrenoceptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
10643177	COX-2-specific inhibition: implications for clinical practice.	Although conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have long been a major therapeutic choice for the management of arthritic conditions, the potential adverse effects of these agents sometimes compromise their clinical utility. New modes of therapy have recently been introduced, and data on the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-specific inhibitors celecoxib and rofecoxib suggest that these agents will meet the need for safe and effective therapeutic alternatives to conventional NSAIDs.
12414107	Localization of sepiapterin reductase in the human brain.	Sepiapterin reductase (SPR) is the enzyme that catalyzes the final step of the synthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), the cofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), tryptophan hydroxylase, and nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Although SPR is essential for synthesizing BH4, the distribution of SPR in the human brain has not yet been clarified. In the present study, we purified recombinant human SPR from cDNA, raised an antibody against human SPR (hSPR), and examined the localization of SPR protein and SPR activity. Human brain homogenates from the substantia nigra (SN), caudate nucleus (CN), gray and white matters of the cerebral cortex (CTX), and dorsal and ventral parts of the medulla oblongata (MO) were subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-hSPR antibody or with anti-TH antibody. Whereas TH protein showed a restricted localization, being mainly detected in the SN and CN, SPR protein was detected in all brain regions examined. SPR activity was relatively high compared with the activity of GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH), the rate-limiting biosynthetic enzyme of BH4, and was more widely distributed than GCH activity. Immunohistochemistry revealed SPR immunoreactivity in pyramidal neurons in the cerebral CTX, in a small number of striatal neurons, and in neurons of the hypothalamic and brain stem monoaminergic fields and olivary nucleus. Double-staining immunohistochemistry showed that TH and SPR were colocalized in the SN dopamine neurons. Localization of SPR immunoreactive neurons corresponded to monoamine or NOS neuronal fields, and also to the areas where no monoamine or NOS neurons were located. The results indicate that there might be a BH4 biosynthetic pathway where GCH is not involved and that SPR might have some yet unidentified function(s) in addition to BH4 biosynthesis.
10659603	[New prospects in the treatment of migraine].	"The options for migraine treatment have increased in the recent years and will expand in the near future. In this work both recent and future options for migraine treatment are critically reviewed. Firstly the late advances in the symptomatic treatment of migraine, including the new 5-HT1B/D agonists ""triptans"" appeared after sumatriptan, are reviewed. Possible alternative, such as selective 5-HT1D and 5-HT1F agonists, are also discussed. In the second part of this manuscript the new, possible options for the preventive treatment of migraine comprising ""antiepileptics"", such as valproic acid, gabapentin and topiramate, calcium-antagonists, such as cyclandelate and dotarizin, and a miscellany, including riboflavin, are analysed. Finally, possible compounds for the future, such as the selective inhibitors of neurokinin receptors or drugs acting upon neuronal calcium channels, are commented. From this review we conclude that while there have been relevant advances in the symptomatic treatment of migraine, there is a need for the development of better preventive compounds."
17896959	Na+/Ca2+ exchange inhibitors: a new class of calcium regulators.	The Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) is a bidirectional transporter that normally extrudes Ca(2+) from the cell (forward mode), but also brings Ca(2+) into the cell (reverse mode) under special conditions such as intracellular Na(+) (Na(+)(i)) accumulation or membrane depolarization. There are three mammalian NCX isoforms: NCX1 is widely expressed in the heart, kidney, brain, blood vessels, and so on; whereas the expression of NCX2 and NCX3 is limited mainly to the brain and skeletal muscle. The pharmacology of NCX inhibitors has been studied extensively since the development of KB-R7943, a prototype benzyloxyphenyl NCX inhibitor, in 1996. Currently, experiments are actively progressing with more selective inhibitors: SEA0400, SN-6, and YM-244769. Intriguingly, the inhibitory potency of benzyloxyphenyl NCX inhibitors is directly coupled to the rate of Na(+)(i)-dependent inactivation. Therefore, the benzyloxyphenyl inhibitors are apparently dormant during the forward mode under normal conditions (low Na(+)(i)), but become effective during the reverse mode under pathological conditions (high Na(+)(i)). This should be an ideal profile for calcium regulators against Na(+)(i)-related diseases, such as ischemia/reperfusion injuries, salt-dependent hypertension, and digitalis arrhythmia. Existing ion channel blockers, such as amiodarone, dronedarone, bepridil, aprindine, and cibenzoline, have been found to have an NCX inhibitory action. It is possible that this property is partly responsible for their antiarrhythmic and cardioprotective effects. This article presents the characteristics of selective and non-selective NCX inhibitors and their therapeutic potential as a new calcium regulator.
16751798	Group I mGlu receptor stimulation inhibits activation-induced cell death of human T lymphocytes.	1. The effects of L-glutamate on activation-induced cell death (AICD) of human activated (1 microg ml(-1) phytohemagglutinin plus 2 U ml(-1) interleukin-2; 8 days) T lymphocytes were studied by measuring anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (10 microg ml(-1); 18 h)-induced cell apoptosis (Annexin V and propidium iodide staining). 2. L-Glutamate (1 x 10(-8)-1 x 10(-4) M) significantly (P < or = 0.01) inhibited AICD in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50=6.3 x 10(-8) M; maximum inhibition 54.8+/-6.3% at 1 x 10(-6) M). 3. The L-glutamate inhibitory effect was pharmacologically characterized as mediated by group I mGlu receptors, since mGlu receptor agonists reproduced this effect. The EC50 values were: 3.2 x 10(-7) M for (1S,3R)-ACPD; 4.5 x 10(-8) M for quisqualate; 1.0 x 10(-6) M for (S)-3,5-DHPG; 2.0 x 10(-5) M for CHPG. 4. Group I mGlu receptor antagonists inhibited the effects of quisqualate 1.0 x 10(-6) M. The IC50 values calculated were: 8.7 x 10(-5), 4.3 x 10(-6) and 6.3 x 10(-7) M for AIDA, LY 367385 and MPEP, respectively. 5. L-Glutamate (1 x 10(-6) M; 18 h) significantly (P < or = 0.05) inhibited FasL expression (40.8+/-11.3%) (cytofluorimetric analysis), whereas it did not affect Fas signalling. 6. Expression of both mGlu1 and mGlu5 receptor mRNA by T lymphocytes and T-cell lines, as demonstrated by reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis, suggests that L-glutamate-mediated inhibition of AICD was exerted on T cells. 7. These data depict a novel role for L-glutamate in the regulation of the immune response through group I mGlu receptor-mediated mechanisms.
17355958	Oxidation and S-nitrosylation of cysteines in human cytosolic and mitochondrial glutaredoxins: effects on structure and activity.	Glutathione (GSH) is the major intracellular thiol present in 1-10-mm concentrations in human cells. However, the redox potential of the 2GSH/GSSG (glutathione disulfide) couple in cells varies in association with proliferation, differentiation, or apoptosis from -260 mV to -200 or -170 mV. Hydrogen peroxide is transiently produced as second messenger in receptor-mediated growth factor signaling. To understand oxidation mechanisms by GSSG or nitric oxide-related nitrosylation we studied effects on glutaredoxins (Grx), which catalyze GSH-dependent thiol-disulfide redox reactions, particularly reversible glutathionylation of protein sulfhydryl groups. Human Grx1 and Grx2 contain Cys-Pro-Tyr-Cys and Cys-Ser-Tyr-Cys active sites and have three and two additional structural Cys residues, respectively. We analyzed the redox state and disulfide pairing of Cys residues upon GSSG oxidation and S-nitrosylation. Cytosolic/nuclear Grx1 was partly inactivated by both S-nitrosylation and oxidation. Inhibition by nitrosylation was reversible under anaerobic conditions; aerobically it was stronger and irreversible, indicating inactivation by nitration. Oxidation of Grx1 induced a complex pattern of disulfide-bonded dimers and oligomers formed between Cys-8 and either Cys-79 or Cys-83. In addition, an intramolecular disulfide between Cys-79 and Cys-83 was identified, predicted to have a profound effect on the three-dimensional structure. In contrast, mitochondrial Grx2 retains activity upon oxidation, did not form disulfide-bonded dimers or oligomers, and could not be S-nitrosylated. The dimeric iron sulfur cluster-coordinating inactive form of Grx2 dissociated upon nitrosylation, leading to activation of the protein. The striking differences between Grx1 and Grx2 reflect their diverse regulatory functions in vivo and also adaptation to different subcellular localization.
11181577	A nonsense mutation in the NDUFS4 gene encoding the 18 kDa (AQDQ) subunit of complex I abolishes assembly and activity of the complex in a patient with Leigh-like syndrome.	Sequence analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear candidate genes of complex I in children with deficiency of this complex and exhibiting Leigh-like syndrome has revealed, in one of them, a novel mutation in the NDUFS4 gene encoding the 18 kDa subunit. Phosphorylation of this subunit by cAMP-dependent protein kinase has previously been found to activate the complex. The present mutation consists of a homozygous G-->A transition at nucleotide position +44 of the coding sequence of the gene, resulting in the change of a tryptophan codon to a stop codon. Such mutation causes premature termination of the protein after only 14 amino acids of the putative mitochondrial targeting peptide. Fibroblast cultures from the patient exhibited severe reduction of the rotenone-sensitive NADH-->UQ oxidoreductase activity of complex I, which was insensitive to cAMP stimulation. Two-dimensional electrophoresis showed the absence of detectable normally assembled complex I in the inner mitochondrial membrane. These findings show that the expression of the NDUFS4 gene is essential for the assembly of a functional complex I.
12824918	Colon cancer cells with high invasive potential are susceptible to induction of apoptosis by a selective COX-2 inhibitor.	Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression has been shown to correlate with the invasiveness of colon cancer cells. To further investigate this positive correlation and its possible therapeutic implications, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, etodolac, was tested on three variants of HT-29 colon cancer cell lines, HT-29/Inv1, HT-29/Inv2 and HT-29/Inv3, with graded increases of in vitro Matrigel invasive potential and COX-2 expression levels. HT-29 variants with higher invasive potential were found to be more sensitive to etodolac by in vitro growth inhibition assays, the estimated LD(50) being 0.5 mM for highly invasive HT-29/Inv2 and HT-29/Inv3 cells, 0.6 mM for slightly less invasive HT-29/Inv1, and 1.8 mM for the parental HT-29. Treatment of the highly invasive HT-29/Inv2 and Inv3 variants with as little as 0.1 mM etodolac in the growth medium produced signs of apoptosis, as detected by DNA fragmentation and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP-biotin nick end labeling) assay. In vivo experiments in SCID mice showed that etolodac inhibited the growth of subcutaneous tumors induced by HT-29/Inv3 cells significantly more than those by the parental HT-29 cells. These results suggest that COX-2 inhibitors have a potential role in prevention of tumor invasion in colon cancer patients.
23435615	The (R)-omeprazole hydroxylation index reflects CYP2C19 activity in healthy Japanese volunteers.	PURPOSE: Omeprazole has (R)- and (S)-enantiomers, which exhibit different pharmacokinetics (PK) among patients with cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 genotype groups. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the 1-point, 4-h postdose (R)-omeprazole hydroxylation index (HI) of racemic omeprazole reflects the three CYP2C19 genotype groups in Japanese individuals. METHODS: Ninety healthy Japanese individuals were enrolled and classified into the three different CYP2C19 genotype groups: homozygous extensive metabolizers (hmEMs; n = 34), heterozygous EMs (htEMs; n = 44), and poor metabolizers (PMs; n = 12). Blood samples were drawn 4 h after the intake of an oral dose of omeprazole 40 mg, and plasma levels of omeprazole and its metabolites were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a chiral column. RESULTS: Mean plasma concentrations of (R)- and (S)-omeprazole in PMs were significantly higher than those in hmEMs and htEMs, and similar results were obtained in the case of omeprazole sulfone. Additionally, there was a significant difference in plasma concentrations of (R)-5-hydroxyomeprazole among CYP2C19 genotype groups, whereas no significant differences were observed in that of (S)-5-hydroxyomeprazole. Similarly, (R)-omeprazole HI in hmEMs, htEMs, and PMs were 5.6, 3.1, and 0.3, respectively, which were significantly different, but no significant difference was present in the (S)-omeprazole HI. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that (R)-omeprazole HI correlated better with CYP2C19 genotype groups than racemic-omeprazole HI, and these results may be useful for classification among patients in CYP2C19 genotype groups prior to omeprazole treatment.
23015691	Quantitative analysis of the interaction of constitutive androstane receptor with chemicals and steroid receptor coactivator 1 using surface plasmon resonance biosensor systems: a case study of the Baikal seal (Pusa sibirica) and the mouse.	The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) not only displays a high basal transcriptional activity but also acts as a ligand-dependent transcriptional factor. It is known that CAR exhibits different ligand profiles across species. However, the mechanisms underlying CAR activation by chemicals and the species-specific responses are not fully understood. The objectives of this study are to establish a high-throughput tool to screen CAR ligands and to clarify how CAR proteins from the Baikal seal (bsCAR) and the mouse (mCAR) interact with chemicals and steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC1). We developed the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) system to assess quantitatively the interaction of CAR with potential ligands and SRC1. The ligand-binding domain (LBD) of bsCAR and mCAR was synthesized in a wheat germ cell-free system. The purified CAR LBD was then immobilized on the sensor chip for the SPR assay, and the kinetics of direct interaction of CARs with ligand candidates was measured. Androstanol and androstenol, estrone, 17β-estradiol, TCPOBOP, and CITCO showed compound-specific but similar affinities for both CARs. The CAR-SRC1 interaction was ligand dependent but exhibited a different ligand profile between the seal and the mouse. The results of SRC1 interaction assay accounted for those of our previous in vitro CAR-mediated transactivation assay. In silico analyses also supported the results of CAR-SRC1 interaction; there is little structural difference in the ligand-binding pocket of bsCAR and mCAR, but there is a distinct discrimination in the helix 11 and 12 of these receptors, suggesting that the interaction of ligand-bound CAR and SRC1 is critical for determining species-specific and ligand-dependent transactivation over the basal activity. The SPR assays demonstrated a potential as a high-throughput screening tool of CAR ligands.
12842269	Binding and GTPgammaS autoradiographic analysis of preproorphanin precursor peptide products at the ORL1 and opioid receptors.	Utilizing agonist-stimulated GTPgammaS autoradiography, we analyzed the ability of preproorphanin FQ (ppOFQ) peptides to stimulate [35S]-GTPgammaS binding in adult rat brain. Orphanin FQ (OFQ) stimulated [35S]-GTPgammaS binding in a pattern similar to that described for [125I]-OFQ at the endogenous opioid receptor-like (ORL1) receptor. The ppOFQ peptides nocistatin and orphanin FQ2 (OFQ II(1-17)) had no effect, suggesting that they do not mediate their reported analgesic effects via a G(i/o)-coupled receptor (i.e. opioid or ORL1). Unlike OFQ II(1-17), high concentrations of its C-terminal extension, OFQ II(1-28), stimulated [35S]-GTPgammaS binding in a mu (mu) opioid receptor-like distribution and the effect was blocked by naloxone. To explore these observations, we evaluated the receptor binding profile of OFQ II(1-28) at the cloned ORL1 and mu opioid receptors. OFQ II(1-28) had no specific binding at either ORL1 or mu opioid receptors at concentrations up to 50 microM. This lack of affinity was not consistent with a mu-mediated effect, as suggested by preliminary observation using functional autoradiography in rat brain sections. Although behavioral studies suggest that OFQ II(1-28) possesses analgesic activity, this effect does not appear to be mediated via direct binding at the mu opioid receptor. Taken together, these findings support the view that (1) OFQ is the only ppOFQ peptide that binds to and activates the ORL1 receptor and (2) OFQ II(1-28) does not bind or stimulate [35S]-GTPgammaS binding in cells expressing the mu opioid receptor.
23444387	Significance of reductive metabolism in human intestine and quantitative prediction of intestinal first-pass metabolism by cytosolic reductive enzymes.	The number of new drug candidates that are cleared via non-cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes has increased. However, unlike oxidation by P450, the roles of reductive enzymes are less understood. The metabolism in intestine is especially not well known. The purposes of this study were to investigate the significance of reductive metabolism in human intestine, and to establish a quantitative prediction method of intestinal first-pass metabolism by cytosolic reductive enzymes, using haloperidol, mebendazole, and ziprasidone. First, we estimated the metabolic activities for these compounds in intestine and liver using subcellular fractions. Metabolic activities were detected in human intestinal cytosol (HIC) for all three compounds, and the intrinsic clearance values were higher than those in human liver cytosol for haloperidol and mebendazole. These metabolic activities in HIC were NADPH- and/or NADH-dependent. Furthermore, the metabolic activities for all three compounds in HIC were largely inhibited by menadione, which has been used as a carbonyl reductase (CBR)-selective chemical inhibitor. Therefore, considering subcellular location, cofactor requirement, and chemical inhibition, these compounds might be metabolized by CBRs in human intestine. Subsequently, we tried to quantitatively predict intestinal availability (Fg) for these compounds using human intestinal S9 (HIS9). Our prediction model using apparent permeability of parallel artificial membrane permeability assay and metabolic activities in HIS9 could predict Fg in humans for the three compounds well. In conclusion, CBRs might have higher metabolic activities in human intestine than in human liver. Furthermore, our prediction method of human Fg using HIS9 is applicable to substrates of cytosolic reductive enzymes.
16313925	Preferential inhibition of human phosphodiesterase 4 by ibudilast.	Ibudilast ophthalmic solution exhibited an improved clinical efficacy over cromoglycate in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. To further characterize its principal mode of action, the phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitory profile of ibudilast has been examined using human recombinant enzymes. Ibudilast, but not the other commonly used anti-allergic ophthalmic solutions including cromoglycate, ketotifen, tranilast and levocabastine, potently inhibits purified human PDE4A, 4B, 4C and 4D with IC50 values at 54, 65, 239 and 166 nM, respectively. Ibudilast effectively blocks lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNFalpha, IC50 = 6.2 microM) and N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP)-induced leukotriene (LT) B4 biosynthesis (IC50 = 2.5 microM) in human whole blood, which are 3 and 6-fold more potent than cilomilast, respectively. The attenuated inflammatory and allergic responses from the potent and preferential PDE4 inhibition of ibudilast may have contributed significantly to its beneficial pharmacological responses and distinguishes ibudilast from the other ophthalmic solutions in the treatment of ocular allergy.
16636450	Soy protein suppresses gene expression of acetyl-coA carboxylase alpha from promoter PI in rat liver.	Dietary soy protein isolate (SPI) reduces hepatic lipogenesis by suppressing gene expression of lipogenic enzymes, including acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). In order to elucidate the mechanism of this regulation, the effect of dietary SPI on promoter (PI and PII) specific gene expression of ACC alpha was investigated. Rats were fed experimental diets containing SPI or casein as a nitrogen source. SPI feeding decreased the hepatic contents of total ACC mRNA as well as triglyceride (TG) content, but dietary SPI affected the amount of sterol-regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-1 mRNA and protein very little. The amount of ACC mRNA transcribed from PII promoter containing SRE was not significantly affected by dietary protein, while a significant decrease in PI-generated ACC mRNA content was observed in rats fed the SPI diet. These data suggest that SPI feeding decreased the hepatic contents of ACC alpha mRNA mainly by regulating PI promoter via a nuclear factor(s) other than SREBP-1.
6146346	Astemizole, a potent histamine H1-receptor antagonist: effect in allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, on antigen and histamine induced skin weal responses and relationship to serum levels.	The efficacy of astemizole, a new, long acting, oral histamine H1-receptor antagonist was compared to placebo for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis during the grass pollen season of 1982. Sixty-three patients with a positive skin prick test to grass pollen and current symptoms participated in an 8 week, double-blind, randomized study. Astemizole, 10 mg, was significantly better than placebo in alleviating both nose (P less than 0.05) and eye (P less than 0.01) symptoms despite significantly greater use of the reserve medication, clemastine, by the placebo group (P less than 0.003). There was a lag period of 5 days after initiation of therapy before treatment benefit became manifest. Subdivision of nasal symptoms indicated significant improvement compared to placebo over the 8 weeks for sneezing (P less than 0.05) and runny nose (P less than 0.05) but not blocked nose. The absence of effect on nasal blockage was confirmed by parallel measurement of nasal calibre by body plethysmography. The antihistaminic potency of astemizole was indicated by an 80% inhibition of the histamine induced skin weal response after 8 weeks therapy. A positive correlation was found between serum drug levels and % inhibition of histamine skin weal (r = 0.64, P less than 0.001). Astemizole was free from adverse sedative or anticholinergic effects but did cause a mean increase in weight of 1.3 kg (P less than 0.01) after 8 weeks therapy, not found with placebo.
16773376	Do nitric oxide donors mimic endogenous NO-related response in plants?	"Huge advances achieved recently in elucidating the role of NO in plants have been made possible by the application of NO donors. However, the application of NO to plants in various forms and doses should be subjected to detailed verification criteria. Not all metabolic responses induced by NO donors are reliable and reproducible in other experimental designs. The aim of the presented studies was to investigate the half-life of the most frequently applied donors (SNP, SNAP and GSNO), the rate of NO release under the influence of light and reducing agents. At a comparable donor concentration (500 microM) and under light conditions the highest rate of NO generation was found for SNAP, followed by GSNO and SNP. The measured half-life of the donor in the solution was 3 h for SNAP, 7 h for GSNO and 12 h for SNP. A temporary lack of light inhibited NO release from SNP, both in the solution and SNP-treated leaf tissue, which was measured by the electrochemical method. Also a NO, selective fluorescence indicator DAF-2DA in leaves supplied with different donors showed green fluorescence spots in the epidermal cells mainly in the light. SNP as a NO donor was the most photosensitive. The activity of PAL, which plays an important role in plant defence, was also activated by SNP in the light, not in the dark. S-nitrosothiols (SNAP and GSNO) also underwent photodegradation, although to a lesser degree than SNP. Additionally, NO generation capacity from S-nitrosothiols was shown in the presence of reducing agents, i.e. ascorbic acid and GSH, and the absence of light. The authors of this paper would like to polemicize with the commonly cited statement that ""donors are compounds that spontaneously break down to release NO"" and wish to point out the fact that the process of donor decomposition depends on the numerous external factors. It may be additionally stimulated or inhibited by live plant tissue, thus it is necessary to take into consideration these aspects and monitor the amount of NO released by the donor."
22884520	Oxysterol generation and liver X receptor-dependent reverse cholesterol transport: not all roads lead to Rome.	Cell cholesterol metabolism is a tightly regulated process, dependent in part on activation of nuclear liver X receptors (LXRs) to increase expression of genes mediating removal of excess cholesterol from cells in the reverse cholesterol transport pathway. LXRs are thought to be activated predominantly by oxysterols generated enzymatically from cholesterol in different cell organelles. Defects resulting in slowed release of cholesterol from late endosomes and lysosomes or reduction in sterol-27-hydroxylase activity lead to specific blocks in oxysterol production and impaired LXR-dependent gene activation. This block does not appear to be compensated by oxysterol production in other cell compartments. The purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge about oxysterol-dependent activation by LXR of genes involved in reverse cholesterol transport, and what these defects of cell cholesterol homeostasis can teach us about the critical pathways of oxysterol generation for expression of LXR-dependent genes.
23409871	Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of indazole arylsulfonamides as allosteric CC-chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) antagonists.	A series of indazole arylsulfonamides were synthesized and examined as human CCR4 antagonists. Methoxy- or hydroxyl-containing groups were the more potent indazole C4 substituents. Only small groups were tolerated at C5, C6, or C7, with the C6 analogues being preferred. The most potent N3-substituent was 5-chlorothiophene-2-sulfonamide. N1 meta-substituted benzyl groups possessing an α-amino-3-[(methylamino)acyl]-group were the most potent N1-substituents. Strongly basic amino groups had low oral absorption in vivo. Less basic analogues, such as morpholines, had good oral absorption; however, they also had high clearance. The most potent compound with high absorption in two species was analogue 6 (GSK2239633A), which was selected for further development. Aryl sulfonamide antagonists bind to CCR4 at an intracellular allosteric site denoted site II. X-ray diffraction studies on two indazole sulfonamide fragments suggested the presence of an important intramolecular interaction in the active conformation.
12692940	[Study on the effect of cysteinyl leukotriene antagonist, pranlukast hydrate, on adhesive interaction between eosinophils and pulmonary endothelial cells].	It has been reported that cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) antagonists reduce the accumulation of eosinophils in the asthmatic airway. However, the exact mechanism of this action remains to be established. In the present study, we examined whether a CysLT antagonist modifies the adhesive interaction between blood eosinophils and endothelial cells. Pranlukast hydrate, a CysLT antagonist, blocked the chemotactic response and adhesion of eosinophils induced by LTD4. On the other hand, pranlukast did not modify the eosinophil spontaneous adhesion to the resting or IL-4 plus TNF-alpha-stimulated pulmonary endothelial cells. Similarly, pranlukast did not modulate IL-5- or FMLP-activated eosinophil adhesion to the resting endothelial cells. Finally, pranlukast did not modify the expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells stimulated with endothelial activating cytokines. These results suggest that the inhibitory action of CysLT antagonist on eosinophil accumulation in the asthmatic airways involves mechanisms other than the adhesive interaction between eosinophils and endothelial cells.
17203585	Differential expression of glycans in the hippocampus of rats trained on an inhibitory learning paradigm.	The glycan chains of glycoconjugates play important roles in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. In the CNS, previous studies on learning and memory suggest the importance of oligosaccharides attached to glycoconjugates in the modulation of synaptic connections. We studied the hippocampal glycan distribution of rats subject to an inhibitory avoidance task. The expression of glycans was examined by lectin-histochemistry using Vicia villosa lectin (VVL) for terminal alpha/beta N-acetylgalactosamine (alpha/beta GalNAc); Galanthus nivalus lectin (GNL) for terminal mannose alpha-1,3 (Man alpha-1,3); Peanut agglutinin (PNA) for galactose beta-1,3N-acetylgalactosamine (Gal beta-1,3 GalNAc); Erythrina cristagalli lectin (ECL) for galactose beta-1,4 N-acetylglucosamine (Gal beta-1,4 GlcNAc); Sambucus nigra lectin (SNA) for sialic acid alpha-2.6 galactose (SA alpha-2,6 Gal); Maackia amurensis lectin II (MAL II) for sialic acid alpha-2,3 (SA alpha-2,3); Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) for terminal N-acetylglucosamine with/ without sialic acid (GlcNAc wo SA); succynilated WGA (sWGA) for terminal N-acetylglucosamine without sialic acid (terminal GlcNAc without SA); Griffonia simplicifolia lectin II (GSL II) for terminal alpha/beta N-acetylglucosamine (alpha/beta GlcNAc terminal); and Lotus tetragonolobus lectin (LTL) alpha-fucose. Two groups of 10 animals were examined: non-trained (Control) and Trained rats. ECL, sWGA and GSL II were negative for both groups in all the hippocampal subfields studied. For both groups, VVL was negative in CA4 and granular cells of the Dentate Gyrus (DG) and LTL was negative in the CA4 subfield. Expression of alpha/beta GalNAc, alpha-fucose and GlcNAc in other hippocampal subflields was positive, with no differences between groups. However, expression of Man alpha-1,3 was significantly higher in the CA1, CA2, CA3, and CA4 subfields in the Trained group. On the other hand, expression of Gal beta-1,3 GalNAc was significantly low in CA4 and DG in the Trained group. In conclusion, the results here presented indicate that the exposure of rats to an associative behavioral paradigm related to declarative memory, involves some regulatory mechanism/s for the differential patterns of glycan expression.
23570999	In vivo and in vitro anti-inflammatory potential of pentahydroxy-pregn-14-ol, 20-one-β-d-thevetopyranoside in rats.	Polyhydroxy pregnane glycoside (PPG), a steroidal glycoside was isolated from Wattakaka volubilis Linn. (Stap.f.). PPG was evaluated for in vivo and in vitro anti-inflammatory activity using acute inflammation and chronic model of inflammation in rats and LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. PPG seemed to be responsible for the anti-inflammatory activity in the studied models. PPG at dose level of both 5 and 10mg/kg significantly reduced the edema induced by the carrageenan in acute model of inflammation. It also showed significant anti-proliferative effect (dry pellet weight basis) in chronic model of inflammation. Cellular content of granuloma was measured by assaying activity of N-acetyl glucosaminidase (NAG) and total nucleic acid content. PPG at 5 and 10mg/kg significantly suppressed the cellular infiltration measured by total nucleic acid content. In contrast, NAG activity decreased over a period of 10 days resulting in inhibition of granuloma weight gain. PPG had a more effective response than the reference drug diclofenac sodium in both the models of inflammation. Wattakaka volubilis steroidal glycoside mixture (WVSM) and PPG (1-50μM) significantly inhibited the COX-2 and iNOS enzymes resulting in low levels of PGE2 and NO in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. Hence the study supports the traditional use of Wattakaka volubilis and its constituent PPG in treatment of inflammatory disorders.
16970975	Non-enzymatic interactions of glyoxylate with lysine, arginine, and glucosamine: a study of advanced non-enzymatic glycation like compounds.	Glyoxylate is a 2 carbon aldo acid that is formed in hepatic tissue from glycolate. Once formed, the molecule can be converted to glycine by alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGAT). In defects of AGAT, glyoxylate is transformed to oxalate, resulting in high levels of oxalate in the body. The objective of this study was 2-fold. First, it was to determine, if akin to D-glucose, D-fructose or DL-glyceraldehyde, glyoxylate was susceptible to non-enzymatic attack by amino containing molecules such as lysine, arginine or glucosamine. Second, if by virtue of its molecular structure and size, glyoxylate was as reactive a reagent in non-enzymatic reactions as DL-glyceraldehyde; i.e., a glycose that we previously demonstrated to be a more effective glycating agent than D-glucose or D-fructose. Using capillary electrophoresis (CE), high performance liquid chromatography and UV and fluorescence spectroscopy, glyoxylate was found to be a highly reactive precursor of advanced glycation like end products (AGLEs) and a more effective promoter of non-enzymatic end products than D-glucose, D-fructose or DL-glyceraldehyde.
12057823	Serotonin transporter polymorphisms and measures of impulsivity, aggression, and sensation seeking among African-American cocaine-dependent individuals.	Considerable evidence indicates that serotonergic mechanisms, particularly the serotonin transporter (5HTT), may mediate central effects of cocaine and may also be involved in impulsive and aggressive behavior. We investigated whether polymorphisms in the 5HTT gene were related to traits of impulsivity, sensation seeking, and aggression among cocaine abusers. Standardized measures of these personality traits were obtained in a sample of 105 severely affected cocaine-dependent African-American subjects and 44 African-American controls. Two polymorphisms of the 5HTT gene were examined involving the 5' promoter (5HTTLPR) region and a 17 base pair variable-number-tandem-repeat (VNTR) marker among cocaine patients. No significant relationships were observed between polymorphic variants of the 5HTTLPR and VNTR regions and scores on any of the trait measures. Similarly, demographic variables and measures of severity of substance use and depression were unrelated to allele frequencies or genotype distributions of the variants among cocaine patients. As expected, cocaine patients scored significantly higher on total scores of impulsivity, aggression, and sensation seeking compared to controls. The findings do not seem to support an association between these polymorphisms in the 5HTT gene and impulsive-aggressive traits among cocaine-dependent African-American individuals.
23640471	Free volume in ionic liquids: a connection of experimentally accessible observables from PALS and PVT experiments with the molecular structure from XRD data.	"In the current work, free volume concepts, primarily applied to glass formers in the literature, were transferred to ionic liquids (ILs). A series of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium ([C4MIM](+)) based ILs was investigated by Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy (PALS). The phase transition and dynamic properties of the ILs [C4MIM][X] with [X](-) = [Cl](-), [BF4](-), [PF6](-), [OTf](-), [NTf2](-) and [B(hfip)4](-) were reported recently (Yu et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2012, 14, 6856-6868). In this subsequent work, attention was paid to the connection of the free volume from PALS (here the mean hole volume, 〈vh〉) with the molecular structure, represented by volumes derived from X-ray diffraction (XRD) data. These were the scaled molecular volume Vm,scaled and the van der Waals volume Vvdw. Linear correlations of 〈vh〉 at the ""knee"" temperature (〈vh〉(Tk)) with Vm,scaled and Vvdw gave good results for the [C4MIM](+) series. Further relationships between volumes from XRD data with the occupied volume Vocc determined from PALS/PVT (Pressure Volume Temperature) measurements and from Sanchez-Lacombe Equation of State (SL-EOS) fits were elaborated (Vocc(SL-EOS) ≈ 1.63 Vvdw, R(2) = 0.981 and Vocc(SL-EOS) ≈ 1.12 Vm,scaled, R(2) = 0.980). Finally, the usability of Vm,scaled was justified in terms of the Cohen-Turnbull (CT) free volume theory. Empirical CT type plots of viscosity and electrical conductivity showed a systematic increase in the critical free volume with molecular size. Such correlations allow descriptions of IL properties with the easily accessible quantity Vm,scaled within the context of the free volume."
11566608	Modulation of epidermal growth factor receptor in endocrine-resistant, oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.	There is an increasing body of evidence demonstrating that growth factor networks are highly interactive with oestrogen receptor (ER) signalling in the control of breast cancer growth. As such, tumour responses to anti- hormones are likely to be a composite of the ER and growth factor inhibitory activity of these agents. The current article examines the modulation of growth factor networks during endocrine response, and presents in vitro and clinical evidence that epidermal growth factor receptor signalling, maintained in either an ER-dependent or -independent manner, is critical to anti- hormonal-resistant breast cancer cell growth. The considerable potential of the epidermal growth factor receptor-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, ZD 1839 (Iressa; AstraZeneca) to efficiently treat, and perhaps even prevent, endocrine-resistant breast cancer is highlighted.
23002087	Arterial stiffness is inversely related to plasma adiponectin levels in young normotensive patients with type 1 diabetes.	OBJECTIVE This study investigated the association between arterial stiffness and plasma adiponectin in patients with type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Participants were normotensive patients with type 1 diabetes who were up to age 40 years. Subjects on statins with macrovascular disease or overt nephropathy were excluded. Large artery stiffness was assessed by measurement of carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), whereas plasma adiponectin was measured by radioimmunoassay. RESULTS Data from 80 patients (age 27.1 ± 6.1 years, BMI 24.2 ± 3.1 kg/m(2), HbA(1c) 7.5 ± 1.6%, 39 men, adiponectin 13.9 ± 6.7 μg/mL, and PWV 5.6 ± 0.9 m/s) were analyzed. Log adiponectin inversely correlated with age-adjusted PWV (r = -0.291, P = 0.009) and waist circumference (r = -0.427, P < 0.001). In a fully adjusted model, age, expiration/inspiration index, and log adiponectin were independently associated with PWV, explaining 39.6% of its variance. CONCLUSIONS Arterial stiffness is inversely related to adiponectin concentration in young patients with type 1 diabetes without major complications.
16719808	NMDA receptors are not alone: dynamic regulation of NMDA receptor structure and function by neuregulins and transient cholesterol-rich membrane domains leads to disease-specific nuances of glutamate-signalling.	Glutamate receptors of the N-methyl-D-asparate (NMDA-) subtype are tetrameric allosteric and ligand-gated calcium channels. They are modulated by a variety of endogenous ligands and ions and play a pivotal role in memory-related signal transduction due to a voltage-dependent block by magnesium, which makes them Hebbian coincidence detectors. On the structural level NMDA receptors have an enormous flexibility due to seven genes (NR1, NR2A-D and NR3A-B), alternative splicing, RNA-editing and extensive posttranslational modifications, like phosphorylation and glycosylation. NMDA receptors are thought to be responsible for excitotoxicity and subsequent downstream events like neuroinflammation and apoptosis and thus have been implicated in many important human pathologies, ranging from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's and Parkinson' disease, depression, epilepsy, trauma and stroke to schizophrenia. This fundamental significance of NMDA receptor-related excitotoxicity is discussed in the context of the developing clinical success of Memantine, but moreover set into relation to various proteomic and genetic markers of said diseases. The very complex localisational and functional regulation of NMDA receptors appears to be dependent on neuregulins and receptor tyrosine kinases in cholesterol-rich membrane domains (lipid rafts), calcium-related mitochondrial feedback-loops and subsynaptic structural elements like PSD-95 (post-synaptic density protein of 95 kD). The flexibility and multitude of interaction partners and possibilities of these highly dynamic molecular systems are discussed in terms of drug development strategies, in particular comparing high affinity and sub-type specific ligands to currently successful or promising therapies.
23582273	Synthesis and antitumor activity of 1,3,4-oxadiazole possessing 1,4-benzodioxan moiety as a novel class of potent methionine aminopeptidase type II inhibitors.	A series of 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives containing 1,4-benzodioxan moiety (7a-7q) have been designed, synthesized and evaluated for their antitumor activity. Most of the synthesized compounds were proved to have potent antitumor activity and low toxicity. Among them, compound 7a showed the most potent biological activity against Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial cells, which was comparable to the positive control. The results of apoptosis and flow cytometry (FCM) demonstrated that compound 7a induce cell apoptosis by the inhibition of MetAP2 pathway. Molecular docking was performed to position compound 7a into MetAP2 binding site in order to explore the potential target.
23485402	Therapeutic effectiveness of botulinum neurotoxin A: Potent blockade of autonomic transmission by targeted cleavage of only the pertinent SNAP-25.	In search of a basis for the impressive potency of an endoprotease that cleaves SNAP-25, botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A), in treating numerous diseases due to hyper-active autonomic nerves, truncation of its target and inhibition of neurotransmission were studied in rat sympathetic neurons. Tetrodotoxin-sensitive spontaneous cholinergic neurotransmission was blocked >80% by 1 pM BoNT/A despite cleaving <20% of the SNAP-25. A maximum cleavage of ∼60% SNAP-25 could be achieved with >1 nM BoNT/A, despite an absence of non-cleavable SNAP-25 in the detergent-solubilised neurons. In contrast, BoNT/E (100 nM) truncated nearly all the SNAP-25 in the intact cells, but was unable to block neurotransmission at low concentrations like BoNT/A. Chimeras created by inserting the acceptor-binding HC domain of BoNT/A into BoNT/E still cleaved all the SNAP-25, indicating ubiquitous expression of BoNT/A acceptors. Accordingly, SV2 and SNAP-25 were found to be co-expressed and broadly co-localised in neurons, but absent from non-neuronal cells. On the other hand, partial cleavage by the BoNT/A protease persisted upon replacing its HC with counterparts from BoNT/E or BoNT/B. Moreover, limited cleavage of SNAP-25 was conferred onto the protease from BoNT/E when fused to the N-terminus of BoNT/A. Thus, the BoNT/A protease is uniquely well-adapted for selectively inactivating the SNAP-25 directly involved in neurotransmission; this together with the toxin's acceptor and its target being localised on the peri-somatic boutons likely contribute to its exceptional therapeutic utility in the clinic.
2879901	Receptor-mediated pharmacodynamics of prednisolone in the rat.	A pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model describing receptor-mediated effects of prednisolone is presented. The basis of the model is the generally accepted mechanism of action of steroid hormones in which corticosteroids bind to cytosolic receptors forming steroid-receptor complexes, which are activated and translocated into the nucleus. There the complexes associate with specific DNA sequences and modulate the rate of transcription of DNA into specific RNAs that code for the synthesis of proteins that elicit biological responses. Prednisolone, 5 or 50 mg/kg, was administered intravenously to adrenalectomized rats. Total plasma, free plasma, CBG-free plasma, and liver prednisolone concentrations were measured simultaneously with free hepatic cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor concentrations and tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) activity of the liver as a function of time. The association/dissociation kinetics of prednisolone binding to the glucocorticoid receptor were measured separately in vitro at 37 degrees C. Total plasma, free plasma, and CBG-free plasma prednisolone concentrations could be used equally well in the model to account for the time course of receptor concentrations and TAT activity. However, use of liver steroid concentrations resulted in an overestimation of receptor depletion. Steroid concentrations in plasma increased 20 to 30-fold with a tenfold increase in dose, but receptor occupancy and TAT activity over time increased about threefold. While prednisolone pharmacokinetics were dose-dependent, parameters describing receptor kinetics and TAT activity were constant at each prednisolone dose. The major determinants of receptor-mediated glucocorticoid activity are confirmed to be the availability of the receptor, drug-receptor dissociation rate, and corticosteroid persistence in the biophase.
23295224	Biocatalytic production of alpha-hydroxy ketones and vicinal diols by yeast and human aldo-keto reductases.	The α-hydroxy ketones are used as building blocks for compounds of pharmaceutical interest (such as antidepressants, HIV-protease inhibitors and antitumorals). They can be obtained by the action of enzymes or whole cells on selected substrates, such as diketones. We have studied the enantiospecificities of several fungal (AKR3C1, AKR5F and AKR5G) and human (AKR1B1 and AKR1B10) aldo-keto reductases in the production of α-hydroxy ketones and diols from vicinal diketones. The reactions have been carried out with pure enzymes and with an NADPH-regenerating system consisting of glucose-6-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. To ascertain the regio and stereoselectivity of the reduction reactions catalyzed by the AKRs, we have separated and characterized the reaction products by means of a gas chromatograph equipped with a chiral column and coupled to a mass spectrometer as a detector. According to the regioselectivity and stereoselectivity, the AKRs studied can be divided in two groups: one of them showed preference for the reduction of the proximal keto group, resulting in the S-enantiomer of the corresponding α-hydroxy ketones. The other group favored the reduction of the distal keto group and yielded the corresponding R-enantiomer. Three of the AKRs used (AKR1B1, AKR1B10 and AKR3C1) could produce 2,3-butanediol from acetoin. We have explored the structure/function relationships in the reactivity between several yeast and human AKRs and various diketones and acetoin. In addition, we have demonstrated the utility of these AKRs in the synthesis of selected α-hydroxy ketones and diols.
17592724	Hydrogen peroxide-mediated oxidative stress disrupts calcium binding on calmodulin: more evidence for oxidative stress in vitiligo.	Patients with acute vitiligo have low epidermal catalase expression/activities and accumulate 10(-3) M H(2)O(2). One consequence of this severe oxidative stress is an altered calcium homeostasis in epidermal keratinocytes and melanocytes. Here, we show decreased epidermal calmodulin expression in acute vitiligo. Since 10(-3)M H(2)O(2) oxidises methionine and tryptophan residues in proteins, we examined calcium binding to calmodulin in the presence and absence of H(2)O(2) utilising (45)calcium. The results showed that all four calcium atoms exchanged per molecule of calmodulin. Since oxidised calmodulin looses its ability to activate calcium ATPase, enzyme activities were followed in full skin biopsies from lesional skin of patients with acute vitiligo (n=6) and healthy controls (n=6). The results yielded a 4-fold decrease of ATPase activities in the patients. Computer simulation of native and oxidised calmodulin confirmed the loss of all four calcium ions from their specific EF-hand domains. Taken together H(2)O(2)-mediated oxidation affects calcium binding in calmodulin leading to perturbed calcium homeostasis and perturbed l-phenylalanine-uptake in the epidermis of acute vitiligo.
23478802	Benzoquinone Reveals a Cysteine-Dependent Desensitization Mechanism of TRPA1.	The transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) nonselective cation channel has a conserved function as a noxious chemical sensor throughout much of Metazoa. Electrophilic chemicals activate both insect and vertebrate TRPA1 via covalent modification of cysteine residues in the amino-terminal region. Although naturally occurring electrophilic plant compounds, such as mustard oil and cinnamaldehyde, are TRPA1 agonists, it is unknown whether arthropod-produced electrophiles activate mammalian TRPA1. We characterized the effects of the electrophilic arthropod defensive compound para-benzoquinone (pBQN) on the human TRPA1 channel. We used whole-cell recordings of human embryonic kidney cells heterologously expressing either wild-type TRPA1 or TRPA1 with three serine-substituted cysteines crucial for electrophile activation (C621S, C641S, C665S). We found that pBQN activates TRPA1 starting at 10 nM and peaking at 300 nM; higher concentrations caused rapid activation followed by a fast decline. Activation by pBQN required reactivity with cysteine residues, but ones that are distinct from those previously reported to be the key targets of electrophiles. The current reduction we found at higher pBQN concentrations was a cysteine-dependent desensitization of TRPA1, and did not require prior activation. The cysteines required for desensitization are not accessible to all electrophiles as iodoacetamide and internally applied 2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl methanesulfonate failed to cause desensitization (despite large activation). Interestingly, following pBQN desensitization, wild-type TRPA1 had dramatically reduced response to the nonelectrophile agonist carvacrol, whereas the triple cysteine mutant TRPA1 retained its full response. Our results suggest that modification of multiple cysteine residues by electrophilic compounds can generate both activation and desensitization of the TRPA1 channel.
23567241	Comparative study on transcriptional activity of 17 parabens mediated by estrogen receptor α and β and androgen receptor.	The structure-activity relationships of parabens which are widely used as preservatives for transcriptional activities mediated by human estrogen receptor α (hERα), hERβ and androgen receptor (hAR) were investigated. Fourteen of 17 parabens exhibited hERα and/or hERβ agonistic activity at concentrations of ⩽1×10(-5)M, whereas none of the 17 parabens showed AR agonistic or antagonistic activity. Among 12 parabens with linear alkyl chains ranging in length from C1 to C12, heptylparaben (C7) and pentylparaben (C5) showed the most potent ERα and ERβ agonistic activity in the order of 10(-7)M and 10(-8)M, respectively, and the activities decreased in a stepwise manner as the alkyl chain was shortened to C1 or lengthened to C12. Most parabens showing estrogenic activity exhibited ERβ-agonistic activity at lower concentrations than those inducing ERα-agonistic activity. The estrogenic activity of butylparaben was markedly decreased by incubation with rat liver microsomes, and the decrease of activity was blocked by a carboxylesterase inhibitor. These results indicate that parabens are selective agonists for ERβ over ERα; their interactions with ERα/β are dependent on the size and bulkiness of the alkyl groups; and they are metabolized by carboxylesterases, leading to attenuation of their estrogenic activity.
23046389	Interspecies variation in the metabolism of zoniporide by aldehyde oxidase.	1. Aldehyde oxidase (AO) is a cytosolic enzyme that contributes to the Phase I metabolism of xenobiotics in human and preclinical species. 2. Current studies explored in vitro metabolism of zoniporide in various animal species and humans using S9 fractions. The animal species included commonly used pharmacology and toxicology models and domestic animals such as the cat, cow or bull, pig and horse. 3. In addition, gender and strain differences in some species were also explored. 4. All animals except the dog and cat converted zoniporide to 2-oxozoniporide (M1). 5. Michael-Menten kinetic studies were conducted in species that turned over zoniporide to M1. 6. Marked differences in KM, Vmax and Clint were observed in the oxidation of zoniporide. 7. Although the KM and Vmax of zoniporide oxidation in male and female human S9 was similar, some gender difference was observed in animals especially, in Vmax. 8. The domestic animals also showed marked species differences in the AO activity and affinity toward zoniporide.
23415228	A genetic program promotes C. elegans longevity at cold temperatures via a thermosensitive TRP channel.	Both poikilotherms and homeotherms live longer at lower body temperatures, highlighting a general role of temperature reduction in lifespan extension. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. One prominent model is that cold temperatures reduce the rate of chemical reactions, thereby slowing the rate of aging. This view suggests that cold-dependent lifespan extension is simply a passive thermodynamic process. Here, we challenge this view in C. elegans by showing that genetic programs actively promote longevity at cold temperatures. We find that TRPA-1, a cold-sensitive TRP channel, detects temperature drop in the environment to extend lifespan. This effect requires cold-induced, TRPA-1-mediated calcium influx and a calcium-sensitive PKC that signals to the transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO. Human TRPA1 can functionally substitute for worm TRPA-1 in promoting longevity. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized function for TRP channels, link calcium signaling to longevity, and, importantly, demonstrate that genetic programs contribute to lifespan extension at cold temperatures.
10193665	Pharmacological profile of neuroleptics at human monoamine transporters.	Using radioligand binding techniques, we determined the equilibrium dissociation constants (K(D)) for 37 neuroleptics and one metabolite of a neuroleptic (haloperidol metabolite) for the human serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine transporters with [3H]imipramine, [3H]nisoxetine, and [3H]WIN35428, respectively. Among neuroleptics, the four most potent compounds at the human serotonin transporter were triflupromazine, fluperlapine, chlorpromazine, and ziprasidone (K(D) 24-39 nM); and at the norepinephrine transporter, chlorpromazine, zotepine, chlorprothixene, and promazine (K(D) 19-25 nM). At the human dopamine transporter, only pimozide (K(D) = 69+/-3) ziprasidone (K(D) = 76+/-5) had notable potency. These data may be useful in predicting therapeutic and adverse effects, including drug interactions of neuroleptics.
10929089	Effects of the inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase 1 or 2 or 5-lipoxygenase on the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis induced by interleukin-1beta in the male Rat.	The limited entry of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) into the central nervous system has led to the hypothesis that IL-1beta acts, through IL-1beta receptors located notably on endothelial cells, on the release of prostaglandins which in turn stimulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. We used cyclo-oxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) inhibitors, before the injection of IL-1beta, to explore the role of arachidonic acid metabolic pathways on HPA axis activation. Adult male rats were i.m injected 20 min before i.p injection of IL-1beta, with (i): a COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor (ketoprofen); (ii) a COX-2 selective inhibitor (NS 398); or (iii) a 5-LOX inhibitor (BW A4C). Following this, rats were killed 90 min after i.p. IL-1beta injection and analysis for plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone concentrations and determination of anterior pituitary pro-opio melanocortin (POMC) gene transcription was conducted. Administration of the COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor led to a complete blockage of ACTH and corticosterone secretion and POMC gene transcription. The COX-2 inhibitor led to a complete blockade of ACTH secretion and POMC gene transcription but had no effect on corticosterone secretion. The 5-LOX inhibitor had no significant effect on any parameter. These results demonstrate the crucial role of eicosanoid pathways in mediating the stimulation of the HPA axis induced by IL-1beta. Moreover, we found a clear dissociation of the effect of the blockage of COXs upon ACTH and corticosterone secretion, suggesting that IL-1beta may act at the brain as well as at the adrenal cortex to stimulate the secretion of corticosterone.
23142325	The role of mitochondria and biotransformation in abamectin-induced cytotoxicity in isolated rat hepatocytes.	Abamectin (ABA), which belongs to the family of avermectins, is used as a parasiticide; however, ABA poisoning can impair liver function. In a previous study using isolated rat liver mitochondria, we observed that ABA inhibited the activity of adenine nucleotide translocator and FoF1-ATPase. The aim of this study was to characterize the mechanism of ABA toxicity in isolated rat hepatocytes and to evaluate whether this effect is dependent on its metabolism. The toxicity of ABA was assessed by monitoring oxygen consumption and mitochondrial membrane potential, intracellular ATP concentration, cell viability, intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis, release of cytochrome c, caspase 3 activity and necrotic cell death. ABA reduces cellular respiration in cells energized with glutamate and malate or succinate. The hepatocytes that were previously incubated with proadifen, a cytochrome P450 inhibitor, are more sensitive to the compound as observed by a rapid decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential accompanied by reductions in ATP concentration and cell viability and a disruption of intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis followed by necrosis. Our results indicate that ABA biotransformation reduces its toxicity, and its toxic action is related to the inhibition of mitochondrial activity, which leads to decreased synthesis of ATP followed by cell death.
22940283	Relation between dynamics, activity and thermal stability within the cholinesterase family.	Incoherent neutron scattering is one of the most powerful tools for studying dynamics in biological matter. Using the cold neutron backscattering spectrometer IN16 at the Institut Laue Langevin (ILL, Grenoble, France), temperature dependence of cholinesterases' dynamics (human butyrylcholinesterase from plasma: hBChE; recombinant human acetylcholinesterase: hAChE and recombinant mouse acetylcholinesterase: mAChE) was examined using elastic incoherent neutron scattering (EINS). The dynamics was characterized by the averaged atomic mean square displacement (MSD), associated with the sample flexibility at a given temperature. We found MSD values of hAChE above the dynamical transition temperature (around 200K) larger than for mAChE and hBChE, implying that hAChE is more flexible than the other ChEs. Activation energies for thermodynamical transition were extracted through the frequency window model (FWM) (Becker et al. 2004) [1] and turned out to increase from hBChE to mAChE and finally to hAChE, inversely to the MSDs relations. Between 280 and 316K, catalytic studies of these enzymes were carried out using thiocholine esters: at the same temperature, the hAChE activity was systematically higher than the mAChE or hBChE ones. Our results thus suggest a strong correlation between dynamics and activity within the ChE family. We also studied and compared the ChEs thermal inactivation kinetics. Here, no direct correlation with the dynamics was observed, thus suggesting that relations between enzyme dynamics and catalytic stability are more complex. Finally, the possible relation between flexibility and protein ability to grow in crystals is discussed.
23109425	Systematic identification of functional residues in mammalian histone H2AX.	The histone variant H2AX is a principal component of chromatin involved in the detection, signaling, and repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). H2AX is thought to operate primarily through its C-terminal S139 phosphorylation, which mediates the recruitment of DNA damage response (DDR) factors to chromatin at DSB sites. Here, we describe a comprehensive screen of 67 residues in H2AX to determine their contributions to H2AX functions. Our analysis revealed that H2AX is both sumoylated and ubiquitylated. Individual residues defective for sumoylation, ubiquitylation, and S139 phosphorylation in untreated and damaged cells were identified. Specifically, we identified an acidic triad region in both H2A and H2AX that is required in cis for their ubiquitylation. We also report the characterization of a human H2AX knockout cell line, which exhibits DDR defects, including p53 activation, following DNA damage. Collectively, this work constitutes the first genetic complementation system for a histone in human cells. Finally, our data reveal new roles for several residues in H2AX and define distinct functions for H2AX in human cells.
10665814	Determinants of voltage-dependent inactivation affect Mibefradil block of calcium channels.	The voltage gated calcium channel family is a major target for a range of therapeutic drugs. Mibefradil (Ro 40-5967) belongs to a new chemical class of these molecules which differs from other Ca2+ antagonists by its ability to potently block T-type Ca2+ channels. However, this molecule has also been shown to inhibit other Ca2+ channel subtypes. To further analyze the mechanism governing the Ca2+ channel-Mibefradil interaction, we examined the effect of Mibefradil on various recombinant Ca2+ channels expressed in mammalian cells from their cloned cDNAs, using Ca2+ as the permeant ion at physiological concentration. Expression of alpha1A, alpha1C, and alpha1E in tsA 201 cells resulted in Ca2+ currents with functional characteristics closely related to those of their native counterparts. Mibefradil blocked alpha1A and alpha1E with a Kd comparable to that reported for T-type channels, but had a lower affinity (approximately 30-fold) for alpha1C. For each channel, inhibition by Mibefradil was consistent with high-affinity binding to the inactivated state. Modulation of the voltage-dependent inactivation properties by the nature of the coexpressed beta subunit or the alpha1 splice variant altered block at the Mibefradil receptor site. Therefore, we conclude that the tissue and sub-cellular localization of calcium channel subunits as well as their specific associations are essential parameters to understand the in vivo effects of Mibefradil.
23557706	mTOR Regulates Nox4-Mediated Podocyte Depletion in Diabetic Renal Injury.	Podocyte apoptosis is a critical mechanism for excessive loss of urinary albumin that eventuates in kidney fibrosis. Pharmacological doses of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin reduce albuminura in diabetes. We explored the hypothesis that mTOR mediates podocyte injury in diabetes. High glucose (HG) induces apoptosis of podocytes, inhibits AMPK activation, inactivates tuberin and activates mTOR. HG also increases the levels of Nox4 and Nox1 and NADPH oxidase activity. Inhibition of mTOR by low dose rapamycin decreases HG-induced Nox4 and Nox1, NADPH oxidase activity and podocyte apoptosis. Inhibition of mTOR had no effect on AMPK or tuberin phosphorylation indicating that mTOR is downstream of these signaling molecules. In isolated glomeruli of OVE26 mice, there is similar decrease in the activation of AMPK and tuberin and activation of mTOR with increase in Nox4 and NADPH oxidase activity. Inhibition of mTOR by small dose of rapamycin reduces podocyte apoptosis, attenuates glomerular injury and albuminuria. Our data provide evidence for a novel function of mTOR in Nox4-derived ROS generation and podocyte apoptosis that contributes to urinary albumin excretion in type 1 diabetes. Thus mTOR and or NADPH oxidase inhibition may represent a therapeutic modality of diabetic kidney disease.
17500228	[Characteristics of A-interferon-generated dendritic cells in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis].	The phenotype of the dendritic cells (DC) generated from the adhesion fraction of mononuclear cells in the presence of GM-CSF and alpha-interferon was studied in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Despite the absence of significant differences in the count of mature CD83+DCs in the groups of patients (n = 38) and healthy donors (n = 30), elevated CD14(+)-monocyte levels and few activated CD25(+)-DCs were indicative of the impaired process of DC maturation/generation in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, particularly in a subgroup of patients with a low T-cell proliferative response against PPD (PPD-anergy, n = 10). The patients with tuberculosis showed the lower relative levels of CD11c(-)-CD123(+)-DC and the normal levels of myeloid CD11c(+)D123(-)DCs. However, in patients with PPD-anergy, the content of myeloid CD11c(+)CD123(-)-DCs was significantly higher than that in PPD-reactive patients. Moreover, the patients with PPD-anergy were characterized by the elevated peripheral blood levels of CD14+CD16(+)-monocytes, which was associated with the high suppressive activity of monocytes (r(s) = 0.53; p < 0.05). The impaired process of DC generation/maturation in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis is believed to be associated with the changes in the phenotypic and functional properties of monocytes and to be a cause of an inadequate antigen-specific response in tuberculous infection.
17409318	Competition between 24:5n-3 and ALA for Delta 6 desaturase may limit the accumulation of DHA in HepG2 cell membranes.	The use of Delta 6 desaturase (D6D) twice in the conversion of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3n-3) to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) suggests that this enzyme may play a key regulatory role in the synthesis and accumulation of DHA from ALA. We examined this using an in vitro model of fatty acid metabolism to measure the accumulation of the long-chain metabolites of ALA in HepG2 cell phospholipids. The accumulation of ALA, eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3), docosapentaenoic acid (22:5n-3), and 24:5n-3 in cell phospholipids was linearly related to the concentration of supplemented ALA over the range tested (1.8-72 microM). The accumulation of the post-D6D products of 22:5n-3, 24:6n-3 and DHA, in cell phospholipids was saturated at concentrations of >18 microM ALA. Supplementation of HepG2 cells with preformed DHA revealed that, although the accumulation of DHA in cell phospholipids approached saturation, the level of DHA in cell phospholipids was significantly greater compared with the accumulation of DHA from ALA, indicating that the accumulation of DHA from ALA was not limited by incorporation. The parallel pattern of accumulation of 24:6n-3 and DHA in response to increasing concentrations of ALA suggests that the competition between 24:5n-3 and ALA for D6D may contribute to the limited accumulation of DHA in cell membranes.
18703043	Agonist-directed trafficking of signalling at serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C-VSV receptors mediated Gq/11 activation and calcium mobilisation in CHO cells.	Several examples of agonist-directed trafficking of receptor signalling at 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors have been reported that involve independent downstream transduction pathways. We now report the functional selectivity of a series of chemically diverse agonists at human (h)5-HT2A, h5-HT2B and h5-HT2C-VSV by examining two related responses, the upstream activation of Gq/11 proteins in comparison with its associated cascade of calcium mobilisation. At the h5-HT2A receptor, d-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and the antiparkinsonian agents lisuride, bromocriptine and pergolide exhibit a higher potency for Gq/11 activation than calcium release in contrast with all the other tested ligands such as 5-HT, mCPP and BW723C86, that show an opposite preference of signalling pathway. Comparable observations are made at h5-HT2B and h5-HT2C-VSV receptors, suggesting a similar mechanism of functional selectivity for the three serotonin receptors. Interestingly, the non-hallucinogenic compound lisuride behaves as a partial agonist for both Gq/11 activation and calcium release at the three 5-HT2 receptors, in contrast with DOI, LSD, pergolide and bromocriptine, which are known to provoke hallucinations, and behave as more efficacious agonists. Hence, a functional selectivity for Gq/11 activation together with a threshold of efficacy at h5-HT2A (and possibly h5-HT2B and/or h5-HT2C-VSV) may contribute to hallucinogenic liability. Thus, our results extend the notion of agonist-directed trafficking of receptor signalling to all the 5-HT2-receptor family and indicate that measures of Gq/11 activation versus calcium release may be useful to identify more effective therapeutic drugs with limited side effects.
10196703	Mortality risk in men is associated with a common mutation in the methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR).	An elevated level of homocysteine in plasma is associated with the occurrence of cardiovascular disease. A common ala-to-val mutation in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR) is associated with an elevated level of plasma homocysteine. We studied the possible detrimental effects of the MTHFR mutation on mortality. Within a population-based study in the city of Leiden, the Netherlands, we first compared the MTHFR genotype distribution among 365 elderly subjects aged 85 years and over born in Leiden, and 250 young subjects aged 18 to 40 years whose families originated from the same geographical region. Second, the complete cohort of 666 subjects aged 85 years and over was followed over a period of 10 years for all-cause and cause-specific mortality and stratified according to MTHFR genotype. The frequency of the MTHFR mutation was significantly lower in the elderly than in the young (0.30 and 0.36, respectively; P = 0.03). The difference in genotype distribution was only present in men. The estimated mortality risk up to 85 years in men carrying the vallval genotype was 3.7 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.3-10.9). Over the age of 85, mortality in men with the vallval genotype was increased 2.0-fold (95% CI, 1.1-3.9) and appeared to be attributable to cancer rather than cardiovascular causes of death. Among women aged 85 years and over, no deleterious effect of the MTHFR mutation was observed. In conclusion, the MTHFR mutation is associated with increased mortality in men in middle and old age, but not in women.
22945693	Methylation levels of sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) promoter in benign and malignant thyroid tumors with reduced NIS expression.	DNA methylation regulates gene expression. Aberrant methylation plays an important role in human tumorigenesis. We have previously detected reduced NIS mRNA expression in thyroid tumors as compared to non-tumor tissues. Thus, in this study we investigated whether the methylation of the CpG-island located in the NIS gene promoter was associated with reduced mRNA expression in thyroid tumors. Methylation levels of 30 pairs of samples from 10 benign and 20 malignant thyroid tumors (T) along with matched non-tumor (NT) areas were determined by semiquantitative methylation specific-PCR. NIS methylation was detected in all samples. Methylation levels and frequencies did not differ between the groups and were not associated with BRAF mutational status. Highest methylation levels and frequencies were detected in the 5' region of the CpG-island decreasing toward the 3' end. Intraindividual analysis (T versus NT) showed high tumor methylation levels in 40 % of the samples in the benign group and 30 % in the malignant group, associated with low NIS mRNA expression. No quantitative correlation was detected between methylation levels and mRNA expression in any the groups. The results of this study showed that methylation of NIS promoter is a very frequent event in both benign and malignant tumors as well as in their surrounding tissues, and characterized a non-homogeneous methylation pattern along the CpG island. Therefore, further investigations involving other sites that may be implicated in methylation regulation of NIS expression are warranted.
10561120	Decreased intracellular proteolysis correlates with the maintenance of a specific isoenzyme of cytochrome P-450.	The rates of intracellular protein degradation, of identically labelled populations of proteins, were compared in hepatocytes cultured at 37 degrees (on an adsorbed collagen layer) and in cells preserved on gelatin gels at 10 degrees C. The half-lives of the long-lived proteins were 35.4+/-8.6 h (N=4) and 692.9+/-216.9 h (N=4) respectively. Proteolysis was substantially decreased at 10 degrees C but the rate of decrease remained constant. Hepatocytes rapidly removed resorufin from the culture medium. The resorufin was not being conjugated or accumulated within the cells. Dicumarol, a potent inhibitor of quinone oxidoreductase, at high concentration (500 microm ) caused only a 72% decrease in the utilization of resorufin. The microsomal detoxifying enzyme, cytochrome P-450 1A1 remained at a constant level in the preserved hepatocyte monolayers. The results of this study strongly favour storing hepatocytes at 10 degrees C rather than at 4 degrees or 37 degrees C.
11470741	Cerivastatin, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, inhibits the signaling pathways involved in the invasiveness and metastatic properties of highly invasive breast cancer cell lines: an in vitro study.	Cerivastatin is used in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia to inhibit 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and thus prevent the synthesis of cholesterol precursors, such as farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), responsible, respectively, for translocation of Ras and Rho to the cell membrane, a step required for their cell signaling, leading to cell proliferation and migration. Recently, it has been suggested that non lipid-related effects of statins could play a beneficial role in cancer therapy. In this study, we have investigated the mechanisms by which statins inhibit cancer and the types of cancers which could benefit from this therapy. In MDA-MB-231 cells, an aggressive breast cancer cell line with spontaneous activation of Ras and NFkappaB and overexpression of RhoA, cerivastatin induced inhibition of both cell proliferation and invasion through Matrigel. This anti-proliferative effect was related to G(1)/S arrest due to an increase in p21(Waf1/Cip1). The anti-invasive effect was observed from 18 h and could be explained by RhoA delocalization from the cell membrane, resulting in disorganization of the actin fibers and disappearance of focal adhesion sites. The importance of RhoA inactivation in both these inhibitory effects was proved by their reversion by GGPP but not by FPP. Moreover, cerivastatin was also shown to induce inactivation of NFkappaB, in a RhoA inhibition-dependent manner, resulting in a decrease in urokinase and metalloproteinase-9 expression, two proteases involved in cell migration. The participation of Ras inactivation is considered a subsidiary mechanism for the effects of cerivastatin, as they were not rescued by FPP. Prolonged treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with high doses of cerivastatin induced a loss of cell attachment. Interestingly, the effect of cerivastatin was considerably lower on poorly invasive MCF-7 cells. In conclusion, our results suggest that cerivastatin inhibits cell signaling pathways involved in the invasiveness and metastatic properties of highly invasive cancers.
2512511	G protein dependent alterations in [125I]iodocyanopindolol and +/- cyanopindolol binding at 5-HT1B binding sites in rat brain membranes.	Several manipulations that affect G protein/receptor coupling also alter the binding of [125I]iodocyanopindolol ([125I]ICYP) and [corrected] +/- cyanopindolol (+/- CYP) to rat brain 5-HT1B binding sites in radioligand binding assays. Inclusion of 5 mM MgSO4 in these assays results in a small but significant increase in the affinity of [125I]ICYP (from KD = 0.046 nM to KD = 0.037 nM). In contrast, 100 microM Gpp(NH)p, GTP, or GDP reduce [125I]ICYP affinity (KD = 0.056 nM with GTP) while ATP and GMP are less effective. +/- CYP affinity for 5-HT1B sites labeled by [3H]dihydroergotamine [( 3H]DE) also displays a small but significant reduction (from Ki = 1.4 nM to Ki = 3.5nM) by the inclusion of 100 microM GTP. Pre-treatment of the brain membranes with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) in concentrations known to inactivate many G proteins reduces 5-HT1B specific binding of [125I]ICYP. The NEM induced reduction in [125I]ICYP binding can be reversed by reconstitution with purified exogenous G proteins (Go and Gi), demonstrating directly that high affinity binding of [125I]ICYP to 5-HT1B sites is dependent on G proteins. The effects of Mg2+ ion, guanine nucleotides, NEM and G protein reconstitution on [125I]ICYP and +/- CYP binding are all hallmarks of agonist binding to G protein linked receptors. The effect of GTP, however, is quantitatively much less for the binding of these pindolol derivatives than for the binding of 5-HT, a presumed full agonist at 5-HT1B sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
17387686	Inhibition of phosphatidylserine biosynthesis in developing rat brain by maternal exposure to ethanol.	Phosphatidylserine (PtdSer), major acidic phospholipids in neuronal membranes, participate in important cell signaling processes. The PtdSer in brain is highly enriched with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3), and the DHA status or ethanol exposure has been shown to influence the PtdSer level. This study shows that ethanol exposure during prenatal and developmental period significantly attenuates microsomal PtdSer biosynthetic activities and reduces PtdSer, particularly 18:0, 22:6-PtdSer, in developing rat brain cortices. Brain microsomes were incubated with deuterium labeled exogenous substrates in vitro and the products formed were detected by reversed phase HPLC-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). These in vitro bioassays showed that 1-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl (18:0, 22:6) species is the best substrate for PtdSer synthesis from both phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn). The PtdSer biosynthetic activity of brain, especially for 18:0, 22:6-PtdSer production, was hampered significantly by maternal exposure to ethanol. PtdSer levels were consistently reduced significantly in brain cortices of the pups from ethanol-exposed dams, due mainly to the depletion of 18:0, 22:6-PtdSer. The mRNA expression of PtdSer synthase 1 (PSS1) and PtdSer synthase 2 (PSS2) was not reduced by ethanol. Similarly, the PSS1 enzyme level did not change after ethanol exposure but PSS2 could not be probed with the antibody available currently. Degradation of PtdSer by mitochondrial PtdSer decarboxylation was not enhanced but also inhibited. Taken together, attenuated PtdSer biosynthetic activities are largely responsible for the PtdSer reduction observed in developing rat brains after maternal exposure to ethanol.
10567921	Functional significance of globotriaosyl ceramide in interferon-alpha(2)/type 1 interferon receptor-mediated antiviral activity.	The N-terminus of the type 1 interferon receptor subunit, IFNAR1, has high amino acid sequence similarity to the receptor binding B subunit of the Escherichia coli-derived verotoxin 1, VT1. The glycolipid, globotriaosyl ceramide (Gb(3): Gal alpha(1) --> 4 Gal beta 1 --> 4 Glu beta 1 --> 1 Cer) is the specific cell receptor for VT1. Gb(3)-deficient variant cells selected for VT resistance are cross-resistant to interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha)-mediated antiproliferative activity. The association of eIFNAR1 with Gal alpha 1 --> 4 Gal containing glycolipids has been previously shown to be important for the receptor-mediated IFN-alpha signal transduction for growth inhibition. The crucial role of Gb(3) for the signal transduction of IFN-alpha-mediated antiviral activity is now reported. IFN-alpha-mediated antiviral activity, nuclear translocation of activated Stat1, and increased expression of PKR were defective in Gb(3)-deficient vero mutant cells, although the surface expression of IFNAR1 was unaltered. The VT1B subunit was found to inhibit IFN-alpha-mediated antiviral activity, Stat1 nuclear translocation and PKR upregulation. Unlike VT1 cytotoxicity, IFN-alpha-induced Stat1 nuclear translocation was not inhibited when RME was prevented, suggesting that the accessory function of Gb(3) occurs at the plasma membrane. IFN-alpha antiviral activity was also studied in Gb(3)-positive MRC-5 cells, which are resistant to IFN-alpha growth inhibition, partially resistant to VT1 but still remain fully sensitive to IFN-alpha antiviral activity, and two astrocytoma cell lines expressing different Gb(3) fatty acid isoforms. In both systems, long chain fatty acid-containing Gb(3) isoforms, which are less effective to mediate VT1 cytotoxicity, were found to correlate with higher IFN-alpha-mediated antiviral activity. Inhibition of Gb(3) synthesis in toto prevented IFN-alpha antiviral activity in all cells. We propose that the long chain Gb(3) fatty isoforms preferentially remain in the plasma membrane, and by associating with IFNAR1, mediate IFN-alpha antiviral signaling, whereas short chain Gb(3) fatty acid isoforms are preferentially internalized to mediate VT1 cytotoxicity and IFNAR1-dependent IFN-alpha growth inhibition.
23536517	The protective effects of taurine on experimental acute pancreatitis in a rat model.	The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of taurine (Tau) on experimental acute pancreatitis (AP) in a rat model by measuring cytokines and oxidant stress markers.Forty rats were randomly divided into four groups: sham, AP, Tau and AP + Tau. AP was induced with sodium taurocholate. No treatment was given to the AP. All rats were killed 5 days later. Pancreatic tissues of rats and blood samples were obtained.Tau treatment significantly decreased serum amylase activity (p < 0.001), total injury score (p < 0.001), malondialdehyde levels (p < 0.001) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the Tau and AP + Tau groups in serum and pancreatic tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 levels (p = 1.000). Histopathologic scores in the AP + Tau and Tau groups were significantly lower compared with the AP group (both p < 0.001).These results showed that Tau reduces lipid peroxidation, amylase and MPO activities and the concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines secondary to AP and also increases superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities in rats with sodium taurocholate-induced AP. It also has a marked ameliorative effect at histopathologic lesions. With these effects, Tau protects the cells from oxidative damage, reduces inflammation and promotes regression of pancreatic damage.
10950934	Chromosomal localization, gene structure, and expression pattern of DDAH1: comparison with DDAH2 and implications for evolutionary origins.	Endogenously produced asymmetrically methylated arginine residues are competitive inhibitors of all three isoforms of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). The enzyme dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) specifically hydrolyzes these asymmetrically methylated arginine residues to citrulline and methylamines. Previously we have proposed that regulation of asymmetric methylarginine concentration by DDAH may provide a novel mechanism for the regulation of NOS activity in vivo. Recently we reported the cloning of human DDAH and identified a novel human DDAH isoform (DDAH I and DDAH II, respectively). Here we report that the DDAH1 gene maps to chromosome 1p22 and confirm that DDAH2 maps to the MHC III region of chromosome 6p21.3. Extensive analysis of the distribution of DDAH1 and DDAH2 mRNA in 50 human tissues indicates differential expression of DDAH isoforms in brain regions, in immune cells, and during development. DDAH2 expression predominates in highly vascularized tissues that express the endothelial NOS isoform and in immune tissues that can express iNOS. Whereas DDAH2 is expressed at relatively high levels in all fetal tissues examined, DDAH1 expression varies little between fetal and adult tissues. The chromosomal localization of the DDAHs is consistent with gene duplication, and consistent with this, comparison of the gene structures indicates that the intron/exon organization is highly conserved. Phylogenetic analysis of DDAH sequences from diverse species suggests that DDAH gene duplication occurred prior to the emergence of bony fish some 400 million years ago. Overall the data suggest that DDAH2 may be the more ancient of the two genes.
17484506	Endometriosis: the way forward.	Endometriosis, a common cause of morbidity, affects 10% of women of reproductive age. In this review we focus on the new developments in pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment options, reviewing the literature published about this enigmatic disorder over the past three years. More specifically, new theories of the pathogenesis of the syndrome of Sampson and Cullen are discussed. The new era of genomics may characterize endometriosis and transform clinical management of the disease. Literature suggesting that endometriosis may have an environmental origin is reviewed. New approaches to medical therapy of endometriosis have been developed, including the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device, aromatase inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs, angiogenesis inhibitors, selective estrogen and progesterone receptor modulators, and statins. Subfertility is another well-known result of endometriosis and often complex decisions must be made regarding management of the endometriosis patient who wishes to conceive. Laparoscopic surgery and assisted reproduction--with or without gonadotropin-releasing hormone-agonist treatment--are reviewed. Finally we speculate about new developments in the field of endometriosis in the coming three years.
23421517	Reversal effect of rosmarinic acid on multidrug resistance in SGC7901/Adr cell.	Multidrug resistance (MDR) has been a major problem in cancer chemotherapy. In this study, the aim was to explore the reversal effect and its potential mechanism of rosmarinic acid (RA) on SGC7901/Adr cells. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to investigate the reversal index of RA in SGC7901/Adr cell line. The intracellular accumulation of adriamycin, rhodamine123 (Rh123), and the expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) were assayed by flow cytometry. The influence of RA on the transcription of MDR1 gene was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that RA could reverse the MDR of SGC7901/Adr cells, increase the intracellular accumulation of Adr and Rh123, and decrease the transcription of MDR1 gene and the expression of P-gp in SGC7901/Adr cells. These results indicated that RA was a potential multidrug resistance-reversing agent and warranted further investigations.
23122078	Purification and characterization of membrane-bound polyphenoloxidase (mPPO) from Snake fruit [Salacca zalacca (Gaertn.) Voss].	Membrane-bound polyphenoloxidase (mPPO) an oxidative enzyme which is responsible for the undesirable browning reaction in Snake fruit (Salacca zalacca (Gaertn.) Voss) was investigated. The enzyme was extracted using a non-ionic detergent (Triton X-114), followed by temperature-induced phase partitioning technique which resulted in two separate layers (detergent-poor phase at the upper layer and detergent-rich phase at the lower layer). The upper detergent-poor phase extract was subsequently fractionated by 40-80% ammonium sulfate and chromatographed on HiTrap Phenyl Sepharose and Superdex 200 HR 10/30. The mPPO was purified to 14.1 folds with a recovery of 12.35%. A single prominent protein band appeared on native-PAGE and SDS-PAGE implying that the mPPO is a monomeric protein with estimated molecular weight of 38kDa. Characterization study showed that mPPO from Snake fruit was optimally active at pH 6.5, temperature 30°C and active towards diphenols as substrates. The K(m) and V(max) values were calculated to be 5.46 mM and 0.98 U/ml/min, respectively, when catechol was used as substrate. Among the chemical inhibitors tested, l-cysteine showed the best inhibitory effect, with an IC(50) of 1.3 ± 0.002 mM followed by ascorbic acid (1.5 ± 0.06 mM), glutathione (1.5 ± 0.07 mM), EDTA (100 ± 0.02 mM) and citric acid (186 ± 0.16 mM).
17092971	In vitro functional characteristics of dopamine D2 receptor partial agonists in second and third messenger-based assays of cloned human dopamine D2Long receptor signalling.	Aripiprazole, (+)terguride, OPC-4392 and (-)3-PPP have been classified as dopamine D(2) receptor partial agonists based largely on their activity in second messenger-based assays of dopamine D(2) receptor signalling. Nevertheless, signal transduction amplification might result in these compounds behaving as dopamine D(2) receptor full agonists at a more downstream level of signalling. We compared the intrinsic activity (E(max), expressed as a percentage of the maximal effect of dopamine) of aripiprazole, (+)terguride, OPC-4392 and (-)3-PPP using second (calcium (Ca(2+)) mobilization) and third (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) phosphoprotein expression) messenger readouts of cloned human dopamine D(2long) (hD(2L)) receptor signalling in CHO cells. These compounds were all less potent and displayed lower intrinsic activity in the Ca(2+) assay (aripiprazole = 24.3%, (+)terguride = 56.9%, OPC-4392 = 58.6% and (-)3-PPP = 75.1%), and aripiprazole (E(max) = 54.5%) displayed a substantially lower intrinsic activity than (+)terguride (E(max) = 92.3%), OPC-4392 (E(max) = 93.1%) and (-)3-PPP (E(max) = 101.1%) in the more downstream-based ERK2 phosphoprotein expression assay. These drug effects on Ca(2+) mobilization and ERK2 phosphoprotein expression were mediated through dopamine hD(2L) receptors, as they all were blocked by (-)raclopride, whereas (-)raclopride and other dopamine D(2) receptor antagonists (haloperidol, risperidone, ziprasidone, olanzapine, clozapine and quetiapine) were inactive on their own in both assays. These data are consistent with clinical evidence that only dopamine D(2) receptor partial agonists with a sufficiently low enough intrinsic activity will prove effective against the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, and also highlight the importance of using downstream-based assays in the discovery of novel D(2) receptor partial agonist therapeutics.
22447684	Quercetin reduces high-fat diet-induced fat accumulation in the liver by regulating lipid metabolism genes.	To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the influence of quercetin on the physiological effects of hyperlipidemia, we investigated its role in the prevention of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and found that it regulated hepatic gene expression related to lipid metabolism. Quercetin supplementation in mice significantly reduced the HFD-induced gains in body weight, liver weight, and white adipose tissue weight compared with the mice fed only with HFD. It also significantly reduced HFD-induced increases in serum lipids, including cholesterol, triglyceride, and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS). Consistent with the reduced liver weight and white adipose tissue weight, hepatic lipid accumulation and the size of lipid droplets in the epididymal fat pads were also reduced by quercetin supplementation. To further investigate how quercetin may reduce obesity, we analyzed lipid metabolism-related genes in the liver. Quercetin supplementation altered expression profiles of several lipid metabolism-related genes, including Fnta, Pon1, Pparg, Aldh1b1, Apoa4, Abcg5, Gpam, Acaca, Cd36, Fdft1, and Fasn, relative to those in HFD control mice. The expression patterns of these genes observed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction were confirmed by immunoblot assays. Collectively, our results indicate that quercetin prevents HFD-induced obesity in C57B1/6 mice, and its anti-obesity effects may be related to the regulation of lipogenesis at the level of transcription.
12142814	Tyrosinemia I, a model for human diseases mediated by 2-oxoacid-utilizing dioxygenases: hepatotoxin suppression by NTBC does not normalize hepatic collagen metabolism.	OBJECTIVES: Medical treatment of tyrosinemia I relies on the herbicide NTBC [Orfadin 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-cyclohexane-1,3-dione], an inhibitor of plant and mammalian 2-oxoacid-utilizing dioxygenases with a collective catalytic cycle ('HAG' mechanism). We hypothesize that NTBC-treated tyrosinemia I is a human model for the pathogenic role of two major enzymes in this class, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (4-HPPD; EC 1.13.11.27) and prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4-H; E.C. 1.14.11.2), essential for tyrosine and collagen metabolism, respectively. METHODS: In a patient with established tyrosinemia I, we monitored the in vivo activities of 4-HPPD and P4-H via five biomarkers before and during NTBC medication. Hypothesis testing at the molecular level was performed by computational modeling of NTBC binding to the crystal structure-derived active site of 4-HPPD, and then relating these findings to our experimental results and to known P4-H data. RESULTS: NTBC rapidly normalized the biomarkers for 4-HPPD activity. However, those for P4-H activity remained uniformly elevated after one hundred days on NTBC, the PIIINP biomarker even increasing above its grossly abnormal, initial level. This selective enzyme inhibition despite a collective catalytic cycle is attributed to the conformation of NTBC, which only fits the active site of 4-HPPD, as confirmed by its crystal structure. CONCLUSIONS: Normalization of hepatic collagen formation, highly desirable in all fibrotic liver diseases, is not achieved by NTBC in tyrosinemia I. By establishing the molecular cause for this failure, our results also establish a rational approach to identify inhibitors that achieve that goal, either by joint 4-HPPD / P-4H inhibition, or by inhibition of only P-4H.
23370194	Synthesis, quantitative structure-activity relationship and biological evaluation of 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives possessing diphenylamine moiety as potential anticancer agents.	Synthesis of 2,5-disubstituted-1,3,4-oxadiazole (2a-c), 3-substituted aminomethyl-5-substituted-1,3,4-oxadiazole-2(3H)-thione (4a-m) and 2-substituted thio-5-substituted-1,3,4-oxadiazole (5a, b) had been described. All the synthesized derivatives were screened for anticancer activity against HT29 and MCF7 cancer cell lines using Sulfo-Rodamine B (SRB) standard method. Most of the tested compounds exploited potent antiproliferative activity against HT29 cancer cell line rather than MCF7 cancer cell line. Compounds 2a-c, 4f and 5a exhibited potent cytotoxicity (IC(50) 1.3-2.0 µM) and selectivity against HT29 cancer cell line. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) study was applied to find a correlation between the experimental antiproliferative activities of the newly synthesized oxadiazole derivatives with their physicochemical parameter and topological index.
23639586	Gene expression profiling and pathway analysis of hepatotoxicity induced by triptolide in Wistar rats.	Triptolide (TP), a major component of TWHF, is widely used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, nephritis and leprosy. However, its clinical use is limited by hepatotoxicity. To further elucidate the underlying mechanism of its hepatotoxic effects, hepatic gene expression profiles were analyzed. TP (1000 and 300μg/kg) was orally administered to Wistar rats for 14days. Current study indicated that female rats were more sensitive to TP-induced hepatotoxicity than males. Genome-wide microarray analyses identified 3329 differentially expressed genes in liver of female rats. Analyses of these genes identified over-represented functions associated with insulin signaling pathway, glucose metabolism, cell cycle, oxidative stress and apoptosis, which were consistent with the results of significant increase of Caspase-3 activity and reduction of serum glucose, GSH/GSSG ratio, glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activities, liver glycogen. In addition, it was observed for the first time that glucocorticoids and IGF1 might get involved in TP-induced hepatotoxicity. These data suggest that TP treatment could alter the hepatic redox status, reduce serum glucose and induce hepatocyte apoptosis, consistent with the differential expression of genes involved in insulin signaling pathway, glucose metabolism pathway and cell stress pathway, all of which might contribute to the overall TP-induced hepatotoxicity.
23562928	Anti-inflammatory activity of hexane extracts from bones and internal organs of Anguilla japonica suppresses cyclooxygenase-2-dependent prostaglandin D2 generation in mast cells and anaphylaxis in mice.	The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of n-hexane extracts from bones and internal organs of Japanese eel, Anguilla japonica (HEE), on cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-dependent prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) generation in stem cell factor (SCF), IL-10, plus LPS-induced mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) and on passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) in mice. HEE suppressed SCF/IL-10/LPS-induced PGD2 generation, and concomitantly reduced COX-2 protein expression dose-dependently. To understand the mechanistic basis for the inhibition of PGD2 generation by HEE, we examined the effects of HEE on upstream signaling pathways essential for COX-2 induction. HEE was found to inhibit the translocation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 subunit to the nucleus and its DNA-binding ability through the inhibition of TAK1, IKK and IκB phosphorylation. Furthermore, HEE also attenuated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-mediated regulation of DNA binding of activator protein-1 (AP-1). Moreover, oral administration of HEE inhibited anti-dinitrophenyl (DNP) IgE-induced PCA in a dose dependent manner. Taken together, the present study provides new insights into the anti-inflammatory activity of HEE, which could be a promising candidate to be used for an inflammatory therapy.
22967140	Role of oestrogen receptors on the modulation of NADPH-diaphorase-positive cell number in supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of ovariectomised female rats.	Modulation of the nitric oxide producing system (demonstrated via the NADPH-diaphorase histochemical reaction) by oestradiol has been established in several structures of the rat brain. The present study aimed to explore the possible regulation of NADPH-diaphorase activity by oestradiol in neurones of the supraoptic (SON) and paraventricular (PVN) nuclei and the role of oestrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ) in this regulation. Adult ovariectomised rats were divided into six groups and injected either with vehicle or a single dose of oestradiol, a selective ERα agonist-PPT [4,4',4″-(4-propyl-[1H]-pyrazole-1,3,5-triyl)trisphenol], a selective ERβ agonist-DPN [2,3-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionitrile], a selective ERα antagonist-MPP [1,3-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4-methyl-5-[4-(2-piperidinylethoxy)phenol]-1H-pyrazole dihydrochloride] or a selective ERβ antagonist-PHTPP (4-[2-phenyl-5,7-bis(trifluoromethyl)pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-3-yl]phenol). The number of NADPH-diaphorase positive elements in the SON and the PVN was modulated by both ERs but, depending on the nucleus, ERα and ERβ ligands induced different effects. These results suggest that the regulation of nitrergic system by ERs may play a role in the control of oestrogen-dependent physiological mechanisms regulated by the SON and the PVN.
18282775	Phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors delay human eosinophil and neutrophil apoptosis in the absence and presence of salbutamol.	In asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the number of eosinophils and neutrophils in the lung is increased. One described mechanism leading to the impaired clearance of these cells from the lung is the delay in their programmed cell death (apoptosis). Selective inhibitors of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are under development for the treatment of lung diseases because of their anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator activity. The aim of the present study was to establish whether inhibitors of PDE3, PDE4 and PDE5 modulate human eosinophil or neutrophil apoptosis or beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist- or cytokine-afforded survival. We also evaluated whether a PDE4 inhibitor could modulate the effect of a corticosteroid on eosinophil and neutrophil apoptosis. Apoptosis was measured by using the relative DNA fragmentation assay and Annexin-V binding. Inhibitors of PDE4 (rolipram; 0.1-10 microM) and PDE3 (cilostazol; 0.1-10 microM) delayed spontaneous eosinophil apoptosis maximally by 25% and 15%, respectively. A combination of a PDE4 or PDE3 inhibitor (10 microM) with salbutamol (100 nM) further delayed eosinophil apoptosis maximally by 42-49%. In neutrophils, rolipram (10 microM) also decreased apoptosis with a maximal inhibition of 13%. The combination of rolipram (10 microM) and salbutamol (100 nM) produced a 27% inhibition of neutrophil apoptosis. Inhibitor of cGMP-specific PDE5 (zaprinast; 0.1-10 microM) did not affect eosinophil apoptosis and only slightly increased spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis. The effect of budesonide on apoptosis was not significantly modulated by a PDE4 inhibitor in eosinophils or neutrophils. The present results show that selective inhibitors of cAMP-hydrolyzing PDEs (PDE3 and PDE4) delay eosinophil apoptosis and, thus, increase their survival in vitro. Furthermore, beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists enhance the anti-apoptotic effects of PDE3 and PDE4 inhibitors, suggesting that such drug combinations may prolong eosinophil and neutrophil longevity in the lung.
23262279	High-throughput identification and characterization of novel, species-selective GPR35 agonists.	Drugs targeting the orphan receptor GPR35 have potential therapeutic application in a number of disease areas, including inflammation, metabolic disorders, nociception, and cardiovascular disease. Currently available surrogate GPR35 agonists identified from pharmacologically relevant compound libraries have limited utility due to the likelihood of off-target effects in vitro and in vivo and the variable potency that such ligands exhibit across species. We sought to identify and characterize novel GPR35 agonists to facilitate studies aimed at defining the physiologic role of GPR35. PathHunter β-arrestin recruitment technology was validated as a human GPR35 screening assay, and a high-throughput screen of 100,000 diverse low molecular weight compounds was conducted. Confirmed GPR35 agonists from five distinct chemotypes were selected for detailed characterization using both β-arrestin recruitment and G protein-dependent assays and each of the human, mouse, and rat GPR35 orthologs. These studies identified 4-{(Z)-[(2Z)-2-(2-fluorobenzylidene)-4-oxo-1,3-thiazolidin-5-ylidene]methyl}benzoic acid (compound 1) as the highest potency full agonist of human GPR35 yet described. As with certain other GPR35 agonists, compound 1 was markedly selective for human GPR35, but displayed elements of signal bias between β-arrestin-2 and G protein-dependent assays. Compound 1 also displayed competitive behavior when assessed against the human GPR35 antagonist, ML-145 (2-hydroxy-4-[4-(5Z)-5-[(E)-2-methyl-3-phenylprop-2-enylidene]-4-oxo-2-sulfanylidene-1,3-thiazolidin-3-yl]butanoylamino]benzoic acid). Of the other chemotypes studied, compounds 2 and 3 were selective for the human receptor, but compounds 4 and 5 demonstrated similar activity at human, rat, and mouse GPR35 orthologs. Further characterization of these compounds and related analogs is likely to facilitate a better understanding of GPR35 in health and disease.
23590413	Canagliflozin , an inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2, for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.	INTRODUCTION: Canagliflozin is an orally administered sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor proposed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Canagliflozin improves glycemic control in an insulin-independent fashion through inhibition of glucose reuptake in the kidney. AREAS COVERED: This article reviews the available data on the pharmacodynamics, the pharmacokinetics and metabolism, and the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin. Relevant articles were identified via PubMed using the search term canagliflozin with no date restriction. The authors also discuss the abstracts from canagliflozin studies presented at large diabetes conferences. EXPERT OPINION: Canagliflozin offers a relatively modest reduction in HbA1c, FPG, and PPG. It has a low incidence of hypoglycemia and a reduction in body weight. Dose adjustment may be recommended in the elderly, those on loop diuretics, and those with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) if there are concerns or symptoms of volume-related side effects. Issues remain with observed increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and the odds of heart attack and stroke. Canagliflozin offers a novel mechanism of action, a modest glycemic control, and a favorable side-effect profile. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in April 2013 and is undergoing evaluation by the European Medicines Agency.
17062721	Treatment-related osteoporosis in men with prostate cancer.	The intended therapeutic effect of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists is hypogonadism, a major cause of acquired osteoporosis in men. Consistent with this observation, GnRH agonists increase bone turnover and decrease bone mineral density, a surrogate for fracture risk. Large claims-based analyses and other retrospective studies provide compelling evidence that GnRH agonists increase risk of clinical fractures. Estrogens play a central role in homeostasis of the normal male skeleton, and estrogen deficiency rather than testosterone deficiency seems to be primarily responsible for the adverse skeletal effects of GnRH agonists. In randomized controlled trials, bisphosphonates (pamidronate and zoledronic acid) and selective estrogen receptor modulators (raloxifene and toremifene) increased bone mineral density in GnRH agonist-treated men. Two ongoing large randomized placebo-controlled studies will prospectively define fracture outcomes in men with prostate cancer and assess the efficacy of novel pharmacologic interventions (AMG162, toremifene) during GnRH agonist treatment.
23561166	Effects of fisetin supplementation on hepatic lipogenesis and glucose metabolism in Sprague-Dawley rats fed on a high fat diet.	The modulatory effects of daily fisetin supplementation for 8weeks on genes involved in hepatic lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis and hyperglycemia in rats fed a high fat (HF) diet were evaluated. Elevated levels of triglyceride (TG), along with hepatic TG content and glucose concentrations in a high fat diet group were found to be reduced by fisetin supplementation. The high fat diet significantly increased hepatic mRNA expressions of PPARγ, SREBP1C and SCD-1 genes in comparison to the control diet, which was subsequently reversed by supplementation with fisetin. In addition, fisetin supplementation significantly reduced hepatic mRNA abundance of FAS, ATPCL and G6Pase compared to the control group. Finally, epididymal mRNA abundance of GLUT4 was significantly increased by fisetin supplementation, compared to levels in the control and HF groups. Enhancement of GLUT4 expression by fisetin was further confirmed in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Fisetin supplementation decreases cardiovascular risks by ameliorating hepatic steatosis and lowering circulating glucose concentrations.
17010609	Gene expression profiling of breast cancer patients treated with docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide within the GEPARTRIO trial: HER-2, but not topoisomerase II alpha and microtubule-associated protein tau, is highly predictive of tumor response.	Gene expression analysis in breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy is an interesting tool for identification of gene signatures and new markers to predict tumor response. However, the detection of predictive markers strongly depends on the drugs used in the specific therapeutic setting. There is growing evidence that topoisomerase II-alpha (TOPO IIalpha) is a marker for anthracycline-, and microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) for taxane sensitivity. HER-2 has been described as a marker of both anthracycline and taxane sensitivity. We performed gene expression profiling of 50 patients within the GEPARTRIO study, an anthracycline and taxane neoadjuvant chemotherapy trial. Here we investigate the predictive value of TOPO IIalpha, MAPT and HER-2 mRNA expression for pathological complete response (pCR) in this setting. Interestingly, HER-2 gene expression was strongly predictive of pCR (P=0.017) as well as overall response (P=0.037) and clinical complete response (cCR, P=0.050). In contrast, for both TOPO IIalpha and MAPT no correlation with pCR was observed in our sample group.
15379894	The arachidonic acid 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid inhibits tumor necrosis factor alpha activation of microglia and extends survival of G93A-SOD1 transgenic mice.	Familial forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) can be caused by mutations in copper, zinc-superoxide dismutase (SOD1). Mice expressing SOD1 mutants demonstrate a robust neuroinflammatory reaction characterized, in part, by up-regulation of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and its primary receptor TNF-RI. In an effort to identify small molecule inhibitors of neuroinflammation useful in treatment of ALS, a microglial culture system was established to identify TNFalpha antagonists. Walker EOC-20 microglia cells were stimulated with recombinant TNFalpha, with or without inhibitors, and the cell response was indexed by NO2- output. Three hundred and fifty-five rationally selected compounds were included in this bioassay. The arachidonic acid 5-lipoxygenase (5LOX) and tyrosine kinase inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), a natural dicatechol, was one of the most potent non-cytotoxic antagonists tested (IC50 8 +/- 3 microm). Investigation of the G93A-SOD1 mouse model for ALS revealed increased message and protein levels of 5LOX at 120 days of age. Oral NDGA (2500 p.p.m.) significantly extended lifespan and slowed motor dysfunction in this mouse, when administration was begun relatively late in life (90 days). NDGA extended median total lifespan of G93A-SOD1 mice by 10%, and life expectancy following start of treatment was extended by 32%. Disease-associated gliosis and cleaved microtubule-associated tau protein, an indicator of axon damage, were likewise reduced by NDGA. Thus, TNFalpha antagonists and especially 5LOX inhibitors might offer new opportunities for treatment of ALS.
23192982	MLL histone methylases regulate expression of HDLR-SR-B1 in presence of estrogen and control plasma cholesterol in vivo.	High-density lipoprotein receptors scavenger receptor class B type I [HDLR-SR-B1 (SR-B1)] is a key player in reverse cholesterol transport and maintaining blood cholesterol. We demonstrated that human SR-B1 is transcriptionally activated by 17β-estradiol (E2) in HEPG2 and JAR cells. SR-B1 promoter contains multiple estrogen response elements (ERE half-sites) along with some Sp1 binding sites. Knockdown of estrogen receptor (ER)α and ERβ down-regulated E2-induced SR-B1 expression. ERs were bound to SR-B1 promoter EREs in an E2-dependent manner. Along with ERs, mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) histone methylases, especially MLL1 and MLL2, play key roles in E2-mediated SR-B1 activation. MLL1 and MLL2 bind to SR-B1 promoter in an E2-dependent manner and control the assembly of transcription pre-initiation complex and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) recruitment. ERs and MLLs play critical roles in determining the cholesterol uptake by steroidogenic tissues/cells, and their knockdown suppressed the E2-induced cholesterol uptake efficiencies of the cells. Intriguingly, MLL2 knockdown in mice resulted in a 33% increase in plasma cholesterol level and also reduced SR-B1 expression in mice liver, demonstrating its crucial functions in controlling plasma cholesterol in vivo.
23530011	Metabolic Effects of Chronic Cannabis Smoking.	OBJECTIVEWe examined if chronic cannabis smoking is associated with hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, reduced β-cell function, or dyslipidemia in healthy individuals.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSIn a cross-sectional, case-control study, we studied cannabis smokers (n = 30; women, 12; men, 18; 27 ± 8 years) and control subjects (n = 30) matched for age, sex, ethnicity, and BMI (27 ± 6). Abdominal fat depots and intrahepatic fat content were quantified by magnetic resonance imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, respectively. Insulin-sensitivity indices and various aspects of β-cell function were derived from oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT).RESULTSSelf-reported cannabis use was: 9.5 (2-38) years; joints/day: 6 (3-30) [median (range)]. Carbohydrate intake and percent calories from carbohydrates, but not total energy intake, were significantly higher in cannabis smokers. There were no group differences in percent total body fat, or hepatic fat, but cannabis smokers had a higher percent abdominal visceral fat (18 ± 9 vs. 12 ± 5%; P = 0.004). Cannabis smokers had lower plasma HDL cholesterol (49 ± 14 vs. 55 ± 13 mg/dL; P = 0.02), but fasting levels of glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, or free fatty acids (FFA) were not different. Adipocyte insulin resistance index and percent FFA suppression during an OGTT was lower (P < 0.05) in cannabis smokers. However, oral glucose insulin sensitivity index, measures of β-cell function, or incretin concentrations did not differ between the groups.CONCLUSIONSChronic cannabis smoking was associated with visceral adiposity and adipose tissue insulin resistance but not with hepatic steatosis, insulin insensitivity, impaired pancreatic β-cell function, or glucose intolerance.
23278398	X-ray crystallography and computational docking for the detection and development of protein-ligand interactions.	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterised by the selective dysfunction and death of the upper and lower motor neurons. Median survival rates are between 3 and 5 years after diagnosis. Mutations in the gene encoding Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) have been linked to a subset of familial forms of ALS (fALS). Herein, we describe a fragment- based drug discovery (FBDD) approach for the investigation of small molecule binding sites in SOD1. X-ray crystallography has been used as the primary screening method and has been shown to directly detect protein-ligand interactions which cannot be unambiguously identified using other biophysical methods. The structural requirements for effective binding at Trp32 are detailed for a series of quinazoline-containing compounds. The investigation of an additional site that binds a range of catecholamines and the use of computational modelling to assist fragment evolution is discussed. This study also highlights the importance of ligand solubility for successful Xray crystallographic campaigns in lead compound design.
23567961	Identification of novel FLT3 kinase inhibitors.	FLT3 and PDGFR tyrosine kinases are important targets for therapy of different types of leukemia. Several FLT3/PDGFR inhibitors are currently under clinical investigation for combination with standard therapy for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), however these agents only induce partial remission and development of resistance has been reported. In this work we describe the identification of potent and novel dual FLT3/PDGFR inhibitors that resulted from our efforts to screen a library of 25,607 small molecules against the FLT3 dependent cell line MOLM-13 and the PDGFR dependent cell line EOL-1. This effort led to the identification of five compounds that were confirmed to be active on additional FLT3 dependent cell lines (cellular EC50 values between 35 and 700 nM), while having no significant effect on 24 other tyrosine kinases.
23339682	Assessment of effects of IR and IPC on activities of cytochrome P450 isozymes in rats by a five-drug cocktail approach.	Abstract Background and objective: To evaluate the effects of ischemia and reperfusion (IR) and ischemic preconditioning (IPC) on the metabolic activities of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes in rats by a five-drug cocktail approach. Methods: Cocktail approach was used to evaluate the influence of IR and IPC on the activities of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2E1, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which were reflected by the changes of pharmacokinetic parameters of five specific probe drugs: caffeine, chlorzoxazone, tolbutamide, metoprolol and midazolam, respectively. Rats were randomly divided into IR, IPC and sham groups, and then injected the mixture of five probe drugs. Blood samples were collected at a series of time-points and the concentrations of probe drugs in plasma were determined by a HPLC method with UV detection. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by the software of DAS 2.0. Results: The parameters including t(1/2β), CLs, AUC, MRT and K(10) exhibited a similar tendency for both IR and IPC groups. Compared with sham group, CLs and K(10) of five probe drugs were significantly lower (p < 0.05), AUC and t(1/2β) of five or some probe drugs were significantly increased in IR and IPC groups (p < 0.05). Compared with IPC group, CLs of five probe drugs were decreased and AUC were significantly increased in the IR group (p < 0.05). Conclusion: IR can variably decrease the activities of CYP isozymes in rats and this decrease can be attenuated by IPC.
10548525	Regulation of gene expression by activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma with rosiglitazone (BRL 49653) in human adipocytes.	To better define the mechanism of action of the thiazolidinediones, we incubated freshly isolated human adipocytes with rosiglitazone and investigated the changes in mRNA expression of genes encoding key proteins of adipose tissue functions. Rosiglitazone (10(-6) M, 4 h) increased p85alphaphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p85alphaPI-3K) and uncoupling protein-2 mRNA levels and decreased leptin expression. The mRNA levels of insulin receptor, IRS-1, Glut 4, lipoprotein lipase, hormone-sensitive lipase, acylation-stimulating protein, fatty acid transport protein-1, angiotensinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and PPARgamma1 and gamma2 were not modified by rosiglitazone treatment. Activation of RXR, the partner of PPARgamma, in the presence of rosiglitazone, increased further p85alphaPI-3K and UCP2 mRNA levels and produced a significant augmentation of Glut 4 expression. Because p85alphaPI-3K is a major component of insulin action, the induction of its expression might explain, at least in part, the insulin-sensitizing effect of the thiazolidinediones.
12023686	Differences in AT2 -receptor stimulation between AT1 -receptor blockers valsartan and losartan quantified by renal interstitial fluid cGMP.	OBJECTIVE: Angiotensin II-receptor blockers are an established class of antihypertensive agents, but the differences between individual members of the class are largely unknown. The present study employed an animal model to demonstrate angiotensin II-receptor blocker-specific effects and to quantify these differences by comparing two common agents, losartan and valsartan. METHODS: We measured the effects on angiotensin II AT2-receptor-mediated renal cGMP by microdialysis in the outer renal cortex in conscious normotensive, sodium-depleted, 4-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats (n = 8) were given equimolar and equidepressor doses of losartan (0.02 mmol/kg) or valsartan (0.02 mmol/kg) either intravenously or orally. Time was allowed for the conversion of losartan into its active metabolite, EXP 3174. RESULTS: Both drugs had equal effects on blood pressure. There were significantly greater increases in cGMP levels after administration of valsartan than of losartan with both routes of administration. Intravenous administration of valsartan led to a 69.1% increase in cGMP, versus a 10.3% increase with losartan. Five hours after oral administration of valsartan, a 48% increase in cGMP was observed versus a 10.9% increase with losartan. The increase after oral administration of valsartan was sustained 8 h after administration, whereas the effect of losartan was not sustained. The effects of losartan and valsartan on cGMP were completely inhibited by AT2-receptor blockade. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that AT1-receptor blockade with valsartan influences AT2-receptor-mediated angiotensin II responses to a greater extent than with losartan, as quantified by renal interstitial fluid cGMP.
12411515	Halothane, isoflurane and sevoflurane inhibit NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) of cardiac mitochondria.	We have investigated the effects of volatile anaesthetics on electron transport chain activity in the mammalian heart. Halothane, isoflurane and sevoflurane reversibly increased NADH fluorescence (autofluorescence) in intact ventricular myocytes of guinea-pig, suggesting that NADH oxidation was impaired. Using pig heart submitochondrial particles we found that the anaesthetics dose-dependently inhibited NADH oxidation in the order: halothane > isoflurane = sevoflurane. Succinate oxidation was unaffected by either isoflurane or sevoflurane, indicating that these agents selectively inhibit complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase). In addition to inhibiting NADH oxidation, halothane also inhibited succinate oxidation (and succinate dehydrogenase), albeit to a lesser extent. To test the hypothesis that complex I is a target of volatile anaesthetics, we examined the effects of these agents on NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (EC 1.6.99.3) activity using the ubiquinone analogue DBQ (decylubiquinone) as substrate. Halothane, isoflurane and sevoflurane dose-dependently inhibited NADH:DBQ oxidoreductase activity. Unlike the classical inhibitor rotenone, none of the anaesthetics completely inhibited enzyme activity at high concentration, suggesting that these agents bind weakly to the 'hydrophobic inhibitory site' of complex I. In conclusion, halothane, isoflurane and sevoflurane inhibit complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) of the electron transport chain. At concentrations of approximately 2 MAC (minimal alveolar concentration), the activity of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase was reduced by about 20 % in the presence of halothane or isoflurane, and by about 10 % in the presence of sevoflurane. These inhibitory effects are unlikely to compromise cardiac performance at usual clinical concentrations, but may contribute to the mechanism by which volatile anaesthetics induce pharmacological preconditioning.
15843826	Antimyeloma effects of a novel synthetic retinoid Am80 (Tamibarotene) through inhibition of angiogenesis.	In multiple myeloma (MM), the interaction between myeloma cells and bone marrow microenvironment has an important role in the pathogenesis of MM. We first examined the inducing effect of myeloma cells on migration of human umbilical vein vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs). Five myeloma cell lines produced varying amounts of VEGF, and migration of HUVECs was induced by coculture with myeloma cells. We next examined the inhibitory effect of a novel synthetic retinoid Am80 (Tamibarotene) on both myeloma cells and HUVECs. Am80 is specific for the retinoic-acid receptor-alpha/beta, and has therapeutic effects in all-trans retinoic acid resistant acute promyelocytic leukemia. Am80 slightly inhibited the growth of both myeloma cells and HUVECs, and remarkably inhibited the growth of HUVECs stimulated by VEGF. Am80 showed little growth inhibition of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), but it markedly inhibited migration of HUVECs by cocultured myeloma cells. Am80 inhibited VEGF-induced phosphorylation of VEGF receptor. In addition, VEGF-induced formation of tube-like structures in vitro and neovascularization in mouse corneas were significantly inhibited by Am80. These findings clearly demonstrate that Am80 is a potential inhibitor of angiogenesis caused by the interaction between vascular endothelial cells and myeloma cells, and might be a useful therapeutic agent against MM.
17234158	Pirfenidone inhibits TGF-beta expression in malignant glioma cells.	Due to its immunosuppressive properties, the cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta has become a promising target in the experimental treatment of human malignant gliomas. Here, we report that the antifibrotic drug 5-methyl-1-phenyl-2-(1H)-pyridone (pirfenidone, PFD) elicits growth-inhibitory effects and reduces TGF-beta2 protein levels in human glioma cell lines. This reduction in TGF-beta2 is biologically relevant since PFD treatment reduces the growth inhibition of TGF-beta-sensitive CCL-64 cells mediated by conditioned media of glioma cells. The downregulation of TGF-beta is mediated at multiple levels. PFD leads to a reduction of TGF-beta2 mRNA levels and of the mature TGF-beta2 protein due to decreased expression and direct inhibition of the TGF-beta pro-protein convertase furin. In addition, PFD reduces the protein levels of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-11, a TGF-beta target gene and furin substrate involved in carcinogenesis. These data define PFD or PFD-related agents as promising agents for human cancers associated with enhanced TGF-beta activity.
23611293	Profiling 976 ToxCast chemicals across 331 enzymatic and receptor signaling assays.	Understanding potential health risks is a significant challenge due to large numbers of diverse chemicals with poorly characterized exposures and mechanisms of toxicities. The present study analyzes 976 chemicals (including failed pharmaceuticals, alternative plasticizers, food additives, and pesticides) in Phase I and II of the U.S. EPA's ToxCast™ project across 331 cell-free enzymatic and ligand-binding high-throughput screening (HTS) assays. Half-maximal activity concentrations (AC50) were identified for 729 chemicals in 256 assays (7,135 chemical-assay pairs). Some of the most commonly affected assays were CYPs (CYP2C9, CYP2C19), transporters (mitochondrial TSPO, norepinephrine, dopaminergic), and GPCRs (aminergic). Heavy metals, surfactants, and dithiocarbamate fungicides showed promiscuous, but distinctly different patterns of activity whereas many of the pharma compounds showed promiscuous activity across GPCRs. Literature analysis confirmed >50% of the activities for the most potent chemical-assay pairs (56), but also revealed 10 missed interactions. Twenty-two chemicals with known estrogenic activity were correctly identified for the majority (77%), missing only the weaker interactions. In many cases, novel findings for previously unreported chemical-target combinations clustered with known chemical-target interactions. Results from this large inventory of chemical-biological interactions can inform read-across methods as well as to link potential targets to molecular initiating events in adverse outcome pathways for diverse toxicities. This abstract does not necessarily reflect U.S. EPA policy.
22749926	Nicotine facilitates memory consolidation in perceptual learning.	Perceptual learning is a special type of non-declarative learning that involves experience-dependent plasticity in sensory cortices. The cholinergic system is known to modulate declarative learning. In particular, reduced levels or efficacy of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine were found to facilitate declarative memory consolidation. However, little is known about the role of the cholinergic system in memory consolidation of non-declarative learning. Here we compared two groups of non-smoking men who learned a visual texture discrimination task (TDT). One group received chewing tobacco containing nicotine for 1 h directly following the TDT training. The other group received a similar tasting control substance without nicotine. Electroencephalographic recordings during substance consumption showed reduced alpha activity and P300 latencies in the nicotine group compared to the control group. When re-tested on the TDT the following day, both groups responded more accurately and more rapidly than during training. These improvements were specific to the retinal location and orientation of the texture elements of the TDT suggesting that learning involved early visual cortex. A group comparison showed that learning effects were more pronounced in the nicotine group than in the control group. These findings suggest that oral consumption of nicotine enhances the efficacy of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Our findings further suggest that enhanced efficacy of the cholinergic system facilitates memory consolidation in perceptual learning (and possibly other types of non-declarative learning). In that regard acetylcholine seems to affect consolidation processes in perceptual learning in a different manner than in declarative learning. Alternatively, our findings might reflect dose-dependent cholinergic modulation of memory consolidation. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Cognitive Enhancers'.
23432061	Possible Involvement of TRP Channels in Cardiac Hypertrophy and Arrhythmia.	Over the past 20 years, studies of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels have significantly extended our knowledge regarding the molecular basis of Ca2+ signals in cardiac myocytes. The functional significance of cardiac TRP channels is likely connected to the alteration of membrane potential or Ca2+ entry into a noncontractile compartment, where gene expression responsible for various cardiac diseases is induced. This review highlights some aspects of TRP channels with anticipated roles in cardiac disease. Evidence suggests that (a) increased activities of TRPC1, TRPC3, or TRPC6 are involved in the development of cardiac hypertrophy, where these TRPC channels act as unique sensors for a wide range of hypertrophic stimuli, and (b) mutations in TRPM4 are now recognized as causes of human cardiac conduction disorders. Ultimately, TRP channels may become novel pharmacological targets in the treatment of human cardiac disease.
19852528	Palonosetron: in the prevention of nausea and vomiting.	Palonosetron is a second-generation serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, with a distinct pharmacological profile that differs from first-generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Intravenous palonosetron is widely indicated for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in the acute and delayed phases following moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) and the prevention of CINV in the acute phase following highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC). In the US, oral palonosetron is approved for the prevention of CINV in the acute phase following MEC (although this formulation is not currently available), and intravenous palonosetron is indicated for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in the first 24 hours following surgery. All indications are currently limited to adult patients. Intravenous palonosetron was noninferior to intravenous ondansetron (with statistically greater efficacy than ondansetron) or dolasetron in preventing CINV following MEC, or to intravenous ondansetron or granisetron in preventing CINV following HEC, in the acute phase. Statistically greater efficacy was seen with intravenous palonosetron than ondansetron or dolasetron in preventing CINV following MEC in the delayed phase. Oral palonosetron was noninferior to intravenous palonosetron in preventing CINV in the acute phase in patients receiving MEC. Intravenous palonosetron was superior to placebo in preventing PONV in the first 24 hours following surgery. Palonosetron was generally well tolerated in clinical trials. Intravenous palonosetron is a valuable option in the prevention of acute- and delayed-phase CINV in adult patients receiving MEC, and of acute-phase CINV in patients receiving HEC. Oral palonosetron is likely to be a useful addition to oral formulations of other 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in preventing CINV in patients receiving MEC. Intravenous palonosetron is a useful alternative to currently recommended agents in PONV prevention.
23579427	Acute alcohol effects on subtypes of impulsivity and the role of alcohol-outcome expectancies.	RATIONALE: It is well established that alcohol acutely impairs the ability to inhibit a pre-potent response (motor impulsivity), but its effects on cognitive impulsivity, including temporal (delayed gratification) and reflection (decision making) impulsivity, are not clear. An important factor contributing to the effects of alcohol is cognitive expectancies of alcohol-related outcomes. OBJECTIVES: The current study investigated the effect of alcohol, and alcohol outcome expectancies, on subtypes of impulsivity. METHODS: Impulsivity was tested using the Stop Signal, the Single Key Impulsivity and the Information Sampling Task for motor, temporal and reflection impulsivity, respectively. Participants (n = 48) received placebo, a low (0.4 g/kg) or high dose (0.8 g/kg) of alcohol, before completing the impulsivity measures. RESULTS: Motor impulsivity was affected by alcohol dose; participants receiving a high dose displayed reduced inhibitory control. Reflection impulsivity was affected by cognitive alcohol expectancies, but not by alcohol condition; participants expecting greater cognitive and behavioural impairment by alcohol exhibited low impulsivity. Temporal impulsivity was not affected by either alcohol dose or outcome expectancies. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the effects of alcohol on the subtypes of impulsivity are dissociable. Motor impulsivity is sensitive to the pharmacological effects of alcohol, whereas the reflection subtype is affected by cognitive alcohol expectancies. The findings have implications for the understanding of impulsive behaviour under the influence of alcohol.
23103562	TNF-α-mediated NF-κB survival signaling impairment by cisplatin enhances JNK activation allowing synergistic apoptosis of renal proximal tubular cells.	Cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity is an important limiting factor for cisplatin use. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is known to contribute to cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity by inducing an inflammatory process aggravating the primary injury, thereby resulting in acute kidney injury (AKI). The present study investigates the pathways synergistically activated by cisplatin and TNF-α responsible for TNF-α-enhanced cisplatin-induced renal cell injury. To do so, immortalized renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (IM-PTECs) were co-treated with TNF-α and cisplatin. Under these conditions, cisplatin induced dose-dependent apoptosis in IM-PTECs, which was significantly enhanced by TNF-α. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that cisplatin inhibited the typical TNF-α response and cisplatin/TNF-α treatment up-regulated cell death pathways while it down-regulated survival pathways compared to cisplatin alone. In concordance, the gene expression levels of kidney injury markers combined with activation of specific inflammatory mediators were enhanced by cisplatin/TNF-α treatment, resembling the in vivo cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity response. Furthermore, combined cisplatin/TNF-α treatment inhibited NF-κB nuclear translocation and NF-κB-mediated gene transcription leading to enhanced and prolonged JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation. JNK sustained activation further inhibited NF-κB signaling via a feedback loop mechanism. This led to an alteration in the transcription of the NF-κB-induced anti-apoptotic genes c-IAP2, Bcl-XL, Bruce and Bcl2 and pro-apoptotic genes Bfk and Xaf1 and consequently to sensitization of the IM-PTECs toward cisplatin/TNF-α-induced toxicity. In conclusion, our findings support a model whereby renal cells exposed to both cisplatin and TNF-α switch into a more pro-apoptotic and inflammatory program by altering their NF-κB/JNK/c-Jun balance.
6703688	The effect of vitamin B6 deficiency on alanine: glyoxylate aminotransferase isoenzymes in rat liver.	Endogenous synthesis of oxalate has been reported to increase in vitamin B6 deficiency probably due to defective transamination of glyoxylate, the direct source of oxalate, to glycine. Alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT) in the liver catalyzes most of the glyoxylate transamination in mammalian tissues (E. V. Rowsell, K. Snell, J. A. Carnie, and K. V. Rowsell (1972) Biochem. J. 127, 155-165). The effects of vitamin B6 deficiency on hepatic AGT isoenzymes, designated AGT 1 and AGT 2, respectively, were examined with male rats; AGT 1 is located both in the peroxisomes and in the mitochondria, and AGT 2 only in the mitochondria. The holo activity of combined peroxisomal and mitochondrial AGT 1 with a low Km for L-alanine rapidly decreased after a lag time of about 2 days during feeding of the vitamin B6-deficient diet (by 50% in 5 days, by 86% in 14 days). Peroxisomal AGT 1 activity was more affected than the mitochondrial. The holo activity of AGT 2 with a high Km for L-alanine decreased more slowly than AGT 1 (by 33% in 14 days, by 60% in 28 days). Urinary excretion of oxalate began to increase in 8-9 days, when AGT 2 remained intact but most of AGT 1 is depleted. When the defect in the glyoxylate transamination in vivo in vitamin B6 deficiency is considered, these findings suggest that it is due to the deficiency of AGT 1. The importance of peroxisomal AGT 1 is discussed, since peroxisomes have been described to be probably the major site of glyoxylate formation.
23288946	Cell wounding activates phospholipase D in primary mouse keratinocytes.	Plasma membrane disruptions occur in mechanically active tissues such as the epidermis and can lead to cell death if the damage remains unrepaired. Repair occurs through fusion of vesicle patches to the damaged membrane region. The enzyme phospholipase D (PLD) is involved in membrane traffickiing; therefore, the role of PLD in membrane repair was investigated. Generation of membrane disruptions by lifting epidermal keratinocytes from the substratum induced PLD activation, whereas removal of cells from the substratum via trypsinization had no effect. Pretreatment with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D₃, previously shown to increase PLD1 expression and activity, had no effect on, and a PLD2-selective (but not a PLD1-selective) inhibitor decreased, cell lifting-induced PLD activation, suggesting PLD2 as the isoform activated. PLD2 interacts functionally with the glycerol channel aquaporin-3 (AQP3) to produce phosphatidylglycerol (PG); however, wounding resulted in decreased PG production, suggesting a potential PG deficiency in wounded cells. Cell lifting-induced PLD activation was transient, consistent with a possible role in membrane repair, and PLD inhibitors inhibited membrane resealing upon laser injury. In an in vivo full-thickness mouse skin wound model, PG accelerated wound healing. These results suggest that PLD and the PLD2/AQP3 signaling module may be involved in membrane repair and wound healing.
12742526	Altered methionine metabolism in long living Ames dwarf mice.	Ames dwarf mice (df/df) are deficient in growth hormone, prolactin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone and live significantly longer than their normal siblings. In the current study, we found that the hormone deficiencies affect methionine metabolism. We previously reported that the dwarf mice exhibit enzyme activities and levels that combat oxidative stress more efficiently than those of normal mice. Moreover, methionine or metabolites of methionine are involved in antioxidative processes. Thus, we performed an experiment that compared various parameters of methionine metabolism between 18-month old male dwarf (N=6) and wild type (N=5) mice. The specific activity of liver methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) was significantly elevated (205%, p<0.0001) in the dwarf mice, as were cystathionine synthase (50%, p<0.01), cystathionase (83%, p<0.001), and glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT, 91%, p<0.001) activities. Even though the activities of MAT and GNMT were elevated, the concentration of liver S-adenosylmethionine was decreased (24%, p<0.001) and S-adenosylhomocysteine increased (113%, p<0.001) in the dwarf mice. These data indicate that dwarf mice, compared to wild type mice, have a markedly different metabolism of methionine. Altered methionine metabolism may partially explain earlier reports indicating less oxidative damage to proteins in dwarf mice. Taken together, the data suggest that methionine metabolism may play a role in oxidative defense in the dwarf mouse and should be studied as a potential mechanism of extended lifespan.
22585450	Effects of Crataegus microphylla on vascular dysfunction in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.	Vascular dysfunction plays a key role in the pathogenesis of diabetic vascular disease. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether chronic in vivo treatment of Crataegus microphylla (CM) extract in diabetic rats induced with streptozotocin (STZ, intraperitoneal, 65 mg/kg) preserves vascular function and to evaluate whether the reduction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), proinflammatory cytokines, and lipid peroxidation mediates its mechanisms of action. Starting at 4 weeks of diabetes, CM extract (100 mg/kg) was administrated to diabetic rats for 4 weeks. In aortic rings, relaxation to acetylcholine and vasoreactivity to noradrenaline were impaired, whereas aortic iNOS expression and plasma tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), total nitrite-nitrate, and malondialdehite levels were increased in diabetic rats compared with controls. Chronic CM treatment significantly corrected all the above abnormalities in diabetic rats. In comparison, pretreatment of the aorta of diabetic rats with N-[3(aminomethyl) benzyl]-acetamidine, dihydrochloride (10(-5)  M), a selective inhibitor of iNOS, produced a similar recovery in vascular reactivity. These results suggest that chronic in vivo treatment of CM preserves endothelium-dependent relaxation and vascular contraction in STZ-induced diabetes, possibly by reducing iNOS expression in the aorta and by decreasing plasma levels of TNF-α and IL-6 and by preventing lipid peroxidation.

23203941	Synthesis, characterization and pharmacodynamics of vitamin-B(12)-conjugated glucagon-like peptide-1.	Clearing the way: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are proving a potent weapon in the treatment of type II diabetes. A new vitamin B(12)-GLP-1 conjugate is investigated and shown to have insulinotropic properties similar to the unmodified peptide. These results are critical to the exploitation of the vitamin B(12) oral uptake pathway for peptide delivery.
17360906	NMDA receptor subunits have differential roles in mediating excitotoxic neuronal death both in vitro and in vivo.	Well-documented experimental evidence from both in vitro and in vivo models of stroke strongly supports the critical involvement of NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity in neuronal damage after stroke. Despite this, the results of clinical trials testing NMDA receptor antagonists as neuroprotectants after stroke and brain trauma have been discouraging. Here, we report that in mature cortical cultures, activation of either synaptic or extrasynaptic NR2B-containing NMDA receptors results in excitotoxicity, increasing neuronal apoptosis. In contrast, activation of either synaptic or extrasynaptic NR2A-containing NMDA receptors promotes neuronal survival and exerts a neuroprotective action against both NMDA receptor-mediated and non-NMDA receptor-mediated neuronal damage. A similar opposing action of NR2B and NR2A in mediating cell death and cell survival was also observed in an in vivo rat model of focal ischemic stroke. Moreover, we found that blocking NR2B-mediated cell death was effective in reducing infarct volume only when the receptor antagonist was given before the onset of stroke and not 4.5 h after stroke. In great contrast, activation of NR2A-mediated cell survival signaling with administration of either glycine alone or in the presence of NR2B antagonist significantly attenuated ischemic brain damage even when delivered 4.5 h after stroke onset. Together, the present work provides a molecular basis for the dual roles of NMDA receptors in promoting neuronal survival and mediating neuronal damage and suggests that selective enhancement of NR2A-containing NMDA receptor activation with glycine may constitute a promising therapy for stroke.
15252033	The anticoagulant thrombin mutant W215A/E217A has a collapsed primary specificity pocket.	The thrombin mutant W215A/E217A features a drastically impaired catalytic activity toward chromogenic and natural substrates but efficiently activates the anticoagulant protein C in the presence of thrombomodulin. As the remarkable anticoagulant properties of this mutant continue to be unraveled in preclinical studies, we solved the x-ray crystal structures of its free form and its complex with the active site inhibitor H-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH(2)Cl (PPACK). The PPACK-bound structure of W215A/E217A is identical to the structure of the PPACK-bound slow form of thrombin. On the other hand, the structure of the free form reveals a collapse of the 215-217 strand that crushes the primary specificity pocket. The collapse results from abrogation of the stacking interaction between Phe-227 and Trp-215 and the polar interactions of Glu-217 with Thr-172 and Lys-224. Other notable changes are a rotation of the carboxylate group of Asp-189, breakage of the H-bond between the catalytic residues Ser-195 and His-57, breakage of the ion pair between Asp-222 and Arg-187, and significant disorder in the 186- and 220-loops that define the Na(+) site. These findings explain the impaired catalytic activity of W215A/E217A and demonstrate that the analysis of the molecular basis of substrate recognition by thrombin and other proteases requires crystallization of both the free and bound forms of the enzyme.
12141946	Identification and characterization of a novel flavin-containing spermine oxidase of mammalian cell origin.	During polyamine catabolism, spermine and spermidine are first acetylated by spermidine/spermine N(1)-acetyltransferase (SSAT) and subsequently oxidized by polyamine oxidase (PAO) to produce spermidine and putrescine, respectively. In attempting to clone the PAO involved in this back-conversion pathway, we encountered an oxidase that preferentially cleaves spermine in the absence of prior acetylation by SSAT. A BLAST search using maize PAO sequences identified homologous mammalian cDNAs derived from human hepatoma and mouse mammary carcinoma: the encoded proteins differed by 20 amino acids. When either cDNA was transiently transfected into HEK-293 cells, intracellular spermine pools decreased by 75% while spermidine and N (1)-acetylspermidine pools increased, suggesting that spermine was selectively and directly oxidized by the enzyme. Substrate specificity using lysates of oxidase-transfected HEK-293 cells revealed that the newly identified oxidase strongly favoured spermine over N (1)-acetylspermine and that it failed to act on N (1)-acetylspermidine, spermidine or the preferred PAO substrate, N (1), N (12)-diacetylspermine. The PAO inhibitor, MDL-72,527, only partially blocked oxidation of spermine while a previously reported PAO substrate, N (1)-( n -octanesulphonyl)spermine, potently inhibited the reaction. Overall, the data indicate that the enzyme represents a novel mammalian oxidase which, on the basis of substrate specificity, we have designated spermine oxidase in order to distinguish it from the PAO involved in polyamine back-conversion. The identification of an enzyme capable of directly oxidizing spermine to spermidine has important implications for understanding polyamine homoeostasis and for interpreting metabolic and cellular responses to clinically relevant polyamine analogues and inhibitors.
23371451	Increased human dermal microvascular endothelial cell survival induced by cysteamine.	BACKGROUND: Cystinosis is an autosomal recessive disease caused by intralysosomal cystine accumulation, treated with cysteamine. Recently, new adverse effects of cysteamine were reported. Skin biopsies showed microvascular proliferation (angioendotheliomatosis). To examine the mechanism of angioendotheliomatosis associated with cysteamine toxicity, we examined the effect of cysteamine on human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMVEC). METHODS: After cysteamine exposure (range 0-3.0 mM) during 24 h, cell viability was measured using water soluble tetrazolium salt-1 (WST-1) in both control HDMVEC and fibroblasts. Cell proliferation and apoptosis rate were measured in HDMVEC by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation and caspase 3 and caspase 7 activity, respectively. Intracellular glutathione (GSH) was measured in HDMVEC after cysteamine exposure of 0, 0.1 or 1.0 mM. Medium and cysteamine were refreshed every 6 h to mimic the in vivo situation. Next, cell viability in HDMVEC was measured after 24 h of GSH exposure (range 0-10.0 mM). RESULTS: HDMVEC viability and proliferation increased after cysteamine exposure 0.03-3.0 mM (p < 0.01) and 0.03-1.0 mM (p = 0.01) respectively; cell viability in fibroblasts was not affected by incubation with cysteamine. Apoptosis remained unaffected by incubation with 0-1.0 mM cysteamine, 3.0 mM caused increased apoptosis. Intracellular GSH was significantly increased after incubation with cysteamine 0.1 mM (p = 0.02) and 1.0 mM (p < 0.01). HDMVEC viability increased after exposure to GSH 1.0-5.0 mM (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Cysteamine concentrations, similar to those described in plasma of cystinosis patients, stimulate HDMVEC viability and proliferation and increase intracellular GSH content. We postulate that this mechanism might underlie angioendotheliomatosis induced by cysteamine.
17210712	Pegylated recombinant human arginase (rhArg-peg5,000mw) inhibits the in vitro and in vivo proliferation of human hepatocellular carcinoma through arginine depletion.	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is believed to be auxotrophic for arginine through the lack of expression of argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS). The successful use of the arginine-depleting enzyme arginine deiminase (ADI) to treat ASS-deficient tumors has opened up new possibilities for effective cancer therapy. Nevertheless, many ASS-positive HCC cell lines are found to be resistant to ADI treatment, although most require arginine for proliferation. Thus far, an arginine-depleting enzyme for killing ASS-positive tumors has not been reported. Here, we provide direct evidence that recombinant human arginase (rhArg) inhibits ASS-positive HCCs. All the five human HCC cell lines we used were sensitive to rhArg but ADI had virtually no effect on these cells. They all expressed ASS, but not ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), the enzyme that converts ornithine, the product of degradation of arginine with rhArg, to citrulline, which is converted back to arginine via ASS. Transfection of HCC cells with OTC resulted in resistance to rhArg. Thus, OTC expression alone may be sufficient to induce rhArg resistance in ASS-positive HCC cells. This surprising correlation between the lack of OTC expression and sensitivity of ASS-positive HCC cells shows that OTC-deficient HCCs are sensitive to rhArg-mediated arginine depletion. Therefore, pretreatment tumor gene expression profiling of ASS and OTC could aid in predicting tumor response to arginine depletion with arginine-depleting enzymes. We have also shown that the rhArg native enzyme and the pegylated rhArg (rhArg-peg(5,000mw)) gave similar anticancer efficacy in vitro. Furthermore, the growth of the OTC-deficient Hep3B tumor cells (ASS-positive and ADI-resistant) in mice was inhibited by treatment with rhArg-peg(5,000mw), which is active alone and is synergistic in combination with 5-fluorouracil. Thus, our data suggest that rhArg-peg(5,000mw) is a novel agent for effective cancer therapy.
11920914	Peripheral site ligands accelerate inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by neutral organophosphates.	The rates of inhibition of mouse acetylcholinesterase (AChE; EC 3.1.1.7) by paraoxon, haloxon, DDVP and enantiomers of neutral alkyl methylphosphonyl thioates and cationic alkyl methylphosphonyl thiocholines were measured in the presence and absence of AChE peripheral site inhibitors: gallamine, d-tubocurarine, propidium, atropine and derivatives of coumarin. All ligands, except the coumarins, at submillimolar concentrations enhanced the rates of inhibition by neutral organophosphates, whereas inhibition rates by cationic organophosphates were decreased. When peripheral site ligand concentrations extended to millimolar concentrations the extent of the enhancement decreased, creating a well-shaped activation profile. Analysis of inhibition by DDVP revealed that peripheral site inhibitors increase the second-order reaction rates by increasing maximal rates of phosphorylation. These observations suggest that peripheral site ligands are capable of allosterically affecting the conformation of residues in the choline binding site of AChE, thus optimizing the position of the leaving group of uncharged organophosphates during the inhibition reaction.
23265509	Purification, antioxidant activity and protein-precipitating capacity of punicalin from pomegranate husk.	Punicalin is a kind of ellagitannin, existing in pomegranate husk, and has shown remarkable biological activities. A rapid and large-scale separation method of punicalin from pomegranate husk was established, using medium pressure liquid chromatography (MPLC). The optimal mobile phase consisted of 5% methanol and 0.1% (v/v) TFA in water, and the optimal loading amount and flow rate were 1.0 g and 80 ml/min, respectively. Under this condition, 339 mg of 95.9% punicalin could be obtained in 40 min. 59.7 mg of 78.0% gallic acid could be separated simultaneously. This method was practical for industrial utilisation of pomegranate husk. Afterwards, the antioxidant and protein-precipitating capacities of the purified punicalin, together with punicalagin, were evaluated. Results showed that punicalin had strong antioxidant activity, and it exhibited a low affinity for protein. This suggested that the antioxidant of punicalin would not be greatly masked by tannin-protein precipitation in application, and hence confirmed punicalin to be a promising antioxidant.
23343565	Binary diffusion coefficients for mixtures of ionic liquids [EMIM][N(CN)2], [EMIM][NTf2], and [HMIM][NTf2] with acetone and ethanol by dynamic light scattering (DLS).	Mutual diffusivities for binary mixtures of the ionic liquids (ILs) [EMIM][N(CN)2] (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanimide), [EMIM][NTf2] (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide), and [HMIM][NTf2] (1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) with acetone and ethanol were studied in dependence on composition in the temperature range from 283.15 to 323.15 K, applying dynamic light scattering (DLS). The influence of experimental parameters on the achievable uncertainties was analyzed to ensure the acquisition of accurate data in adequate measurement times. For all probed systems, increasing binary diffusion coefficients were found for increasing temperatures. The systematic variation of anion and cation of the investigated ILs as well as a comparison with the literature data demonstrates the considerable influence of different ions on the resulting binary diffusion coefficients. Mutual diffusivities were found to be lower for the mixtures with ethanol than for those with acetone, which could be related to the formation of hydrogen bonds between ethanol and the ions. Most of the investigated IL solvent mixtures show increasing binary diffusion coefficients with increasing solvent concentration. For the mixtures of [EMIM][NTf2] with ethanol, however, a minimum of the mutual diffusivities was found in the ethanol mole fraction range from 0.7 to 0.8, which may hint at the vicinity of a critical demixing point. The viscosity of the pure ILs turned out to be no reliable indicator for the mutual diffusivity in mixtures with the same solvent.
23379686	Self-aggregation properties of ionic liquid 1,3-didecyl-2-methylimidazolium chloride in aqueous solution: from spheres to cylinders to bilayers.	The self-aggregation behavior of the double-chained ionic liquid (IL) 1,3-didecyl-2-methylimidazolium chloride ([C10C10mim]Cl) in aqueous solution has been investigated with a number of different experimental techniques. Two cmc values (cmc1 and cmc2) are obtained from conductivity measurements. The fraction of neutralized charge on the micellar surface suggests that cmc1 corresponds to the formation of spherical micelles and cmc2 to the transition from spherical to cylindrical micelles. Data obtained from fluorescence spectroscopy (using pyrene and Nile red as chemical probes), fluorescence anisotropy (using rhodamine B as probe), and chemical shift (1)H NMR (in D2O) provide a picture that is also consistent with a sphere-to-cylinder transition. This structural change is further confirmed by diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY), from the self-diffusion coefficients for surfactant unimer and aggregates. Furthermore, a third evolution from cylindrical micelles to bilayer aggregates is proposed from the analysis of diffusion coefficients at high surfactant concentration ([IL] > 0.2 M). Phase scanning experiments performed with polarized light microscopy clearly demonstrate the presence of a lamellar liquid crystalline phase at very high IL concentration, thus confirming the coexistence of bilayer structures with elongated micelles, found at lower concentration. Additionally, [C10C10mim]Cl micelles are proposed as novel reaction media, as evidenced by the solvolysis reaction of 4-methoxybenzenesulfonyl chloride (MBSC).
23456363	Hypoxia-inducible factor and vascular endothelial growth factor are targets of dietary soy during acute stroke in female rats.	Dietary soy and soy isoflavones are neuroprotective in experimental cerebral ischemia. Because these isoflavones have estrogenic properties, we hypothesized that, like estrogens, they would inhibit acute vascular injury and the detrimental acute increase in hypoxia-induced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that leads to cerebral edema after stroke. Mature ovariectomized female Sprague Dawley rats were fed soy-free or soy-containing diets for 4 weeks followed by 90 minutes of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Similar to estrogens, dietary soy significantly reduced cerebral edema and vascular apoptosis 24 hours after stroke. Soy also inhibited the ischemia-induced increase in cortical VEGF and VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-2 protein expression observed 4 and 24 hours after stroke, although mRNA levels increased. The reduction in VEGF/VEGFR-2 was associated both with decreases in receptor phosphorylation and signaling to AKT and endothelial nitric oxide synthase. Furthermore degradation of the VEGFR-2 was increased with dietary soy. The primary ischemic stimulus for VEGF, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α), was similarly reduced by dietary soy 4 hours after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in both the cortex and striatum. The inhibition of HIF1α activity was further confirmed by a significant decrease in the HIF1α-activated apoptotic mediator BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3 (Nip3-like protein X). These data suggest that soy isoflavones target events early in the ischemic cascade as part of their neuroprotective actions and counterbalance some of the detrimental effects of the endogenous response to cerebral injury.
23567950	Synthesis and biological evaluation of novel aliphatic amido-quaternary ammonium salts for anticancer chemotherapy: Part II.	A series of novel aliphatic amido-quaternary ammonium salts were synthesized and evaluated for their anticancer effects involving induction of RhoB. Most of these compounds, featuring open-ring forms of aliphatic amido-quaternary ammonium salts, exhibited potent anti-proliferative activities in human cancer cell lines, including PC-3, NUGC-3, MDA-MB-231, ACHN, HCT-15, and NCI-H23. In further evaluation, the representative compound N,N-diethyl-N-(2-(N-methyltetradecanamido)ethyl)prop-2-en-1-aminium bromide (3b) exhibited potent pro-apoptotic activity, through RhoB activation, in HeLa cells.
23271002	In vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory effects of 4-methoxy-5- hydroxycanthin-6-one, a natural alkaloid from Picrasma quassioides.	In the present study, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory effect of 4-methoxy-5- hydroxycanthin-6-one (CAN), a natural alkaloid isolated from Picrasma quassioides. CAN significantly inhibited the production of NO and the release of TNF-α induced by LPS in macrophage RAW 264.7. Western blot showed that CAN can downregulate the expression of iNOS protein. After oral administration, CAN (3, 9, and 27 mg/kg) reduced the development of carrageenan-induced paw edema and complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced chronic arthritis in rats. The observed results indicated that pre-treatment with CAN might be an effective therapeutic intervention against inflammatory diseases including chronic arthritis.
23292797	Smoothened is a fully competent activator of the heterotrimeric G protein G(i).	Smoothened (Smo) is a 7-transmembrane protein essential to the activation of Gli transcription factors (Gli) by hedgehog morphogens. The structure of Smo implies interactions with heterotrimeric G proteins, but the degree to which G proteins participate in the actions of hedgehogs remains controversial. We posit that the G(i) family of G proteins provides to hedgehogs the ability to expand well beyond the bounds of Gli. In this regard, we evaluate here the efficacy of Smo as it relates to the activation of G(i), by comparing Smo with the 5-hydroxytryptamine(1A) (5-HT(1A)) receptor, a quintessential G(i)-coupled receptor. We find that with use of [(35)S]guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate, first, with forms of G(i) endogenous to human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells made to express epitope-tagged receptors and, second, with individual forms of Gα(i) fused to the C terminus of each receptor, Smo is equivalent to the 5-HT(1A) receptor in the assay as it relates to capacity to activate G(i). This finding is true regardless of subtype of G(i) (e.g., G(i2), G(o), and G(z)) tested. We also find that Smo endogenous to HEK-293 cells, ostensibly through inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, decreases intracellular levels of cAMP. The results indicate that Smo is a receptor that can engage not only Gli but also other more immediate effectors.
15563582	Structural determinants of arylacetic acid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs necessary for binding and activation of the prostaglandin D2 receptor CRTH2.	The chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th2 cells (CRTH2) receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor that mediates chemotaxis of inflammatory cells in response to prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), is hypothesized to play a role in Th2-mediated allergic disease. In addition to PGD2, CRTH2 can be activated by indomethacin, a nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitor and widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). To evaluate the structural features that confer CRTH2 binding selectivity, structure-activity relationship analysis of arylacetic acid class NSAIDs as CRTH2 receptor ligands was performed. Indomethacin, sulindac sulfide, and zomepirac displaced [3H]PGD2 binding at the mouse CRTH2 receptor (mCRTH2) with comparable affinity (Ki = 1.5 +/- 0.1, 2.5 +/- 0.4, and 3.3 +/- 0.3 microM, respectively). The indomethacin metabolite 5'-O-desmethyl indomethacin (5'-DMI) possessed binding affinity similar to indomethacin; however, elimination of the 2-methyl substituent on the indole ring resulted in a 10-fold decrease in binding affinity. No binding was detected for indole acetic acid and indole derivatives such as tryptophan, serotonin, and 5-hydroxy indole acetic acid, demonstrating the importance of the N-acyl moiety of indomethacin. Neutral derivatives of indomethacin also failed to bind to mCRTH2, suggesting that the negatively charged carboxylate moiety participates in a key ligand-receptor interaction. Despite similar binding affinities, NSAID-type mCRTH2 ligands exhibited variable potencies as mCRTH2 agonists. Sulindac sulfide and 5'-DMI inhibited intracellular cyclic AMP ([cAMP]i) generation and stimulated cell migration comparable with indomethacin. In contrast, zomepirac did not inhibit [cAMP]i generation or stimulate cell migration but weakly antagonized the effects of indomethacin on [cAMP]i. Together, these results reveal structural features of arylacetic acid NSAIDs that may be exploited for the development of selective CRTH2 ligands.
23624419	Evaluation of the positive effects on insulin-resistance and β-cell measurements of vildagliptin in addition to metformin in type 2 diabetic patients.	We evaluated the positive effects of vildagliptin in addition to metformin on glycemic control and β-cell function in type 2 diabetic patients. One hundred and seventy-one type 2 diabetic patients were instructed to add vildaglipin 50mg twice a day or placebo to metformin for 12 months. Body mass index (BMI), glycemic control, fasting plasma insulin (FPI), HOMA-IR, HOMA-β, fasting plasma proinsulin (FPPr), proinsulin/fasting plasma insulin ratio (Pr/FPI ratio), C-peptide, glucagon, vaspin, visfatin, and omentin-1 were evaluated. Before, and after 12 months since the addition of vildagliptin, patients underwent a combined euglycemic hyperinsulinemic and hyperglycemic clamp, with subsequent arginine stimulation. Vildagliptin+metformin were more effective than placebo+metformin in reducing body weight and BMI, glycemic control, HOMA-IR, glucagon and insulin resistance measurements. Vildagliptin+metformin gave also a better increase of HOMA-β, and of all β-cell parameters after the clamp. We also recorded a significant correlation between M value increase and the decrease of vaspin, visfatin, and omentin-1 obtained with vildagliptin+metformin. Vildagliptin, in addition to metformin, proved to be effective in improving β-cell function and in reducing insulin resistance measurements.
23519149	Predictive factors of sensitivity to elisidepsin, a novel kahalalide f-derived marine compound.	Elisidepsin (PM02734, Irvalec®) is a synthetic marine-derived cyclic peptide of the Kahalalide F family currently in phase II clinical development. Elisidepsin was shown to induce rapid oncosis in ErbB3-expressing cells. Other predictive factors of elisidepsin sensitivity remained unknown. A panel of 23 cancer cell lines of different origin was assessed for elisidepsin cytotoxicity and correlated with mutational state, mRNA and protein expression of selected genes. Elisidepsin showed potent and broad cytotoxic effects in our cancer cell line panel, being active at concentrations ranging from 0.4 to 2 μM that may be relevant for clinical settings. We have shown that elisidepsin is more active in cells harboring epithelial phenotype with high E-cadherin and low vimentin expression. In addition, high ErbB3 and Muc1 expression was correlated with sensitivity to elisidepsin, whereas the presence of KRAS activating mutations was associated with resistance. In DU-PM cells with acquired resistance to elisidepsin, ErbB3 expression was decreased, while Bcl2 was increased. DU-PM cells displayed higher sensitivity to ErbB1-inhibitors suggesting possible cross-talk of ErbB1 and ErbB3 signaling pathways. Combinations of elisidepsin with lapatinib and several chemotherapies including 5-FU and oxaliplatin resulted in synergistic effects that offer the potential of clinical use of elisidepsin in combination settings.
7905294	Ethanol inhibits glutamate-induced currents in heteromeric NMDA receptor subtypes.	Maximal L-glutamate/glycine-evoked currents were inhibited by ethanol in Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing recombinant heteromeric NMDA receptors consisting of NR1-NR2A, NR1-NR2B, and NR1-NR2C subunit combinations. Concentration-dependent inhibition was observed at ethanol concentrations of > or = 50 mM both in Ca(2+)-containing and Ca(2+)-deficient, Ba(2+)-containing Mg(2+)-free media. The NR1-NR2C channels were slightly less sensitive to ethanol inhibition than the other heteromeric channels in Ca(2+)-deficient, Ba(2+)-containing medium. The inhibition was unaffected by the clamping-voltage and by a mutation [NR1-NR2A(N595Q)] that prevents the Mg(2+)-blockade of the channels, indicating that the mechanism of action of ethanol differs from that of Mg2+. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the NMDA receptor subtypes can mediate many behavioural actions of ethanol.
23261524	Live-cell imaging of p53 interactions using a novel Venus-based bimolecular fluorescence complementation system.	"p53 plays an important role in regulating a wide variety of cellular processes, such as cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. Dysfunction of p53 is frequently associated with several pathologies, such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. In recent years substantial progress has been made in developing novel p53-activating molecules. Importantly, modulation of p53 interaction with its main inhibitor, Mdm2, has been highlighted as a promising therapeutic target. In this regard, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis, by providing direct visualization of protein interactions in living cells, offers a straightforward method to identify potential modulators of protein interactions. In this study, we developed a simple and robust Venus-based BiFC system to screen for modulators of p53-p53 and p53-Mdm2 interactions in live mammalian cells. We used nutlin-3, a well-known disruptor of p53-Mdm2 interaction, to validate the specificity of the assay. The reduction of BiFC signal mediated by nutlin-3 was correlated with an increase in Puma transactivation, PARP cleavage, and cell death. Finally, this novel BiFC approach was exploited to identify potential modulators of p53-Mdm2 complex formation among a commercially available chemical library of 33 protein phosphatase inhibitors. Our results constitute ""proof-of-concept"" that this model has strong potential as an alternative to traditional target-based drug discovery strategies. Identification of new modulators of p53-p53 and p53-Mdm2 interactions will be useful to achieve synergistic drug efficacy with currently used anti-tumor therapies."
14633707	Epidermal growth factor receptor autocrine signaling in RIE-1 cells transformed by the Ras oncogene enhances radiation resistance.	Oncogenic forms of the small GTPase Ras increase the resistance of cells to killing by ionizing radiation (IR). Although not all of the signaling pathways for radioresistance are well defined, it is now clear that Ras-dependent signaling pathways involved in radioresistance include those mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3-K) and Raf. Nevertheless, PI3-K and Raf together are not sufficient to reconstitute all of the resistance conferred by Ras, indicating that other effectors must also contribute. We show here that Ras-driven autocrine signaling through the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) also contributes to radioresistance in Ras-transformed cells. Conditioned media (CM) collected from RIE-1 rat intestinal epithelial cells expressing oncogenic Ras increased the survival of irradiated cells. Ras-CM contains elevated levels of the EGFR ligand transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha). Both Ras-CM and TGF-alpha stimulated EGFR phosphorylation, and exogenous TGF-alpha mimicked the effects of Ras-CM to increase radioresistance. Blocking EGFR signaling with the EGFR/HER-2 kinase inhibitor (KI) GW572016 decreased the postradiation survival of irradiated Ras-transformed cells and normal cells but had no effect on the survival of unirradiated cells. Ras-CM and TGF-alpha also increase PI3-K activity downstream of the EGFR and increase postradiation survival, both of which are abrogated by GW572016. Thus, Ras utilizes autocrine signaling through EGFR to increase radioresistance, and the EGFR KI GW572016 acts as a radiosensitizer. The observation that Ras-transformed cells can be sensitized to killing by ionizing radiation with GW572016 demonstrates that EGFR KIs could potentially be used to radiosensitize tumors in which radioresistance is dependent on Ras-driven autocrine signaling through EGFR.
11923794	Pharmacodynamic profile of the direct thrombin antagonist bivalirudin given in combination with the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist eptifibatide.	BACKGROUND: Because of the adverse characteristics associated with heparin, direct antagonists of thrombin have been investigated as anticoagulants during percutaneous coronary interventions. However, the hematologic and clinical interactions between direct thrombin antagonists and inhibitors of platelet glycoprotein IIb-IIIa are incompletely explored. METHODS: Forty-two patients who underwent elective percutaneous coronary intervention were randomized to receive a bivalirudin 1.0 mg/kg bolus followed by a 4-hour infusion at 2.5 mg/kg/h; a bivalirudin 0.75 mg/kg bolus followed by a 4-hour infusion at 1.75 mg/kg; or a heparin 60 U/kg bolus. All the patients also received eptifibatide, given as 2 sequential boluses of 180 microg/kg followed by a 2 microg/kg/min infusion for 18 to 24 hours, and aspirin. RESULTS: After the bolus dose of the study drug, turbidimetric platelet aggregation in response to 5 micromol/L adenosine diphosphate increased in patients assigned to heparin but not those assigned to bivalirudin. After eptifibatide, platelet aggregation was eliminated in all 3 treatment groups. The effect of heparin and the effects of both bivalirudin regimens on the formation of thrombin antithrombin complexes and prothrombin fragment 1.2 were comparable. Neither agent affected the formation of platelet-monocyte complexes or expression of CD 63 lysosomal antigen. There were no major bleeding events, and a single non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (MI) occurred in a patient treated with bivalirudin. CONCLUSION: These findings show the feasibility of combining the direct thrombin antagonist bivalirudin with a potent antagonist of platelet glycoprotein IIb-IIIa. Clinical trials are needed to assess the safety and efficacy of this combination.
1692236	Differences in conformational stability between native and phosphorylated acetylcholinesterase as evidenced by a monoclonal antibody.	Monoclonal antibody 25B1 generated against diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate inhibited fetal bovine serum acetylcholinesterase has been extensively characterized with respect to its anticholinesterase properties. This antibody demonstrated considerably different properties from previously reported inhibitory antibodies raised against acetylcholinesterase in terms of the degree of inhibition (greater than 98%), the high degree of specificity, and the stability of the antigen-antibody complex. Monoclonal antibody 25B1 appears to be directed against a conformational epitope located in close proximity to the catalytic center of the enzyme and was found to be most suitable for studying the stabilization of the active site of acetylcholinesterase against denaturation by heat or guanidine following phosphorylation by organophosphorus anticholinesterase compounds. This approach allowed the determination of stability rank order of various phosphorylated acetylcholinesterases. Among all the organophosphates tested, the combination of a methyl group and a negatively charged oxygen attached to the P atom, CH3P(O)(O-)-AChE, conferred the greatest protection to the active site of aged or nonaged organophosphoryl conjugates of acetylcholinesterase.
10224140	Molecular cloning and characterization of a new multispecific organic anion transporter from rat brain.	A cDNA encoding the new member of the multispecific organic anion transporter family, OAT3, was isolated by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction cloning method. Degenerate primers were designed based on the sequences conserved among OAT1, OAT2, and organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1), and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed using rat brain poly(A)+ RNA. The 536-amino acid protein sequence encoded by OAT3 showed 49, 39, and 36% identity to those of OAT1, OAT2, and OCT1, respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed that rat OAT3 mRNA is expressed in the liver, brain, kidney, and eye. When expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, OAT3 mediated the uptake of organic anions, such as p-aminohippurate (Km = 65 microM), ochratoxin A (Km = 0.74 microM), and estrone sulfate (Km = 2.3 microM) and a cationic compound, cimetidine. OAT3-mediated uptake of [3H]estrone sulfate was sodium-independent. para-Aminohippuric acid, estrone sulfate or ochratoxin A did not show any trans-stimulatory effect on either influx or efflux of [3H]estrone sulfate via OAT3. Organic anions such as sulfobromophthalein, probenecid, indocyanine green, bumetanide, piroxicam, furosemide, azidodeoxythymidine, 4, 4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-3,3'-disulfonic acid, and benzylpenicillin inhibited OAT3-mediated estrone sulfate uptake, while ouabain and digoxin did not. Organic cations such as tetraethylammonium, guanidine, verapamil, and quinidine did not interact with OAT3. Acidic metabolites of neurotransmitters derived from dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and serotonin inhibited the uptake of estrone sulfate via OAT3. These results suggest an important role of OAT3 in the excretion/detoxification of endogenous and exogenous organic anions, especially from the brain.
23528251	Cross-talk between constitutive androstane receptor and hypoxia-inducible factor in the regulation of gene expression.	Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) and 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase are often activated under similar physiological conditions. Constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) translocates into the nucleus in accordance with 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase and thus confers transactivation. The aim of the present study was to investigate a possible link between CAR and HIFα. Phenobarbital (PB), a typical CAR activator, increased the gene expression of HIF-target genes in the livers of mice, including erythropoietin, heme oxygenase-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor-a. PB induced an accumulation of nuclear HIF-1α and an increase in the HIF-responsive element-mediated transactivation in HepG2 cells. Cobalt chloride, a typical HIF activator, induced the gene expression of CAR-target genes, including cyp2b9 and cyp2b10, an accumulation of nuclear CAR and an increase in the PB-responsive enhancer module-mediated transactivation in the mouse liver. Immunoprecipitation-immunoblot and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses suggest that CAR binds to the PB-responsive enhancer module with HIF-1α in the liver of untreated mice and that the complex dissociates upon PB treatment. Taken together these results suggest that CAR and HIF-α interact and reciprocally modulate the functions of each other.
23511125	Acetylcholinesterase inhibition reveals endogenous nicotinic modulation of glutamate inputs to CA1 stratum radiatum interneurons in hippocampal slices.	The involvement of brain nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the neurotoxicological effects of soman, a potent acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor and a chemical warfare agent, is not clear. This is partly due to a poor understanding of the role of AChE in brain nAChR-mediated functions. To test the hypothesis that AChE inhibition builds sufficient acetylcholine (ACh) in the brain and facilitates nAChR-dependent glutamate transmission, we used whole-cell patch-clamp technique to record spontaneous glutamate excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) from CA1 stratum radiatum interneurons (SRI) in hippocampal slices. First, the frequency, amplitude and kinetics of EPSCs recorded from slices of control guinea pigs were compared to those recorded from slices of guinea pigs after a single injection of the irreversible AChE inhibitor soman (25.2μg/kg, s.c.). Second, EPSCs were recorded from rat hippocampal slices before and after their superfusion with the reversible AChE inhibitor donepezil (100nM). The frequency of EPSCs was significantly higher in slices taken from guinea pigs 24h but not 7 days after the soman injection than in slices from control animals. In 52% of the rat hippocampal slices tested, bath application of donepezil increased the frequency of EPSCs. Further, exposure to donepezil increased both burst-like and large-amplitude EPSCs, and increased the proportion of short (20-100ms) inter-event intervals. Donepezil's effects were suppressed significantly in presence of 10μM mecamylamine or 10nM methyllycaconitine. These results support the concept that AChE inhibition is able to recruit nAChR-dependent glutamate transmission in the hippocampus and such a mechanism can contribute to the acute neurotoxicological actions of soman.
23155202	Influence of coadministration of artemether and lumefantrine on selected plasma biochemical and erythrocyte oxidative stress indices in female Wistar rats.	Among the artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) regimens, artemisinin derivative, artemether in combination with lumefantrine (artemether-lumefantrine, AL) has achieved excellent results in the fight against malarial scourge. In this study, we evaluated the toxic potential of these drugs at the therapeutic doses in female Wistar rats. Animals were randomly divided into four groups: those administered 1% Tween 80 (control), those administered artemether (4 mg/kg body weight), those administered lumefantrine (24 mg/kg body weight), and those coadministered artemether (4 mg/kg body weight) and lumefantrine (24 mg/kg body weight). The drugs were orally administered twice daily for 3 days by gastric intubation after which selected plasma biochemical indices, and erythrocytes antioxidant defence and lipid peroxidation markers were evaluated. Coadministration of artemether and lumefantrine raised liver and renal function markers and increased atherogenic index. While reduced glutathione, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and catalase activities were reduced, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-s-transferase activities increased in all the treated groups compared to the control group. The drugs caused significant (p < 0.05) elevation of malondialdehyde (MDA) levels compared to the control group. These results imply that coadministration of artemether and lumefantrine may increase the risks of atherosclerosis as well as liver and renal function impairments in the users. In addition, the drugs may also promote oxidative stress in the erythrocytes.
15110853	Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors: aromatic and heterocyclic sulfonamides incorporating adamantyl moieties with strong anticonvulsant activity.	A series of aromatic/heterocyclic sulfonamides incorporating adamantyl moieties were prepared by reaction of aromatic/heterocyclic aminosulfonamides with the acyl chlorides derived from adamantyl-1-carboxylic acid and 1-adamantyl-acetic acid. Related derivatives were obtained from the above-mentioned aminosulfonamides with adamantyl isocyanate and adamantyl isothiocyanate, respectively. Some of these derivatives showed good inhibitory potency against two human CA isozymes involved in important physiological processes, CA I, and CA II, of the same order of magnitude as the clinically used drugs acetazolamide and methazolamide. The lipophilicity of the best CA inhibitors was determined and expressed as their experimental log k' IAM and theoretical ClogP value. Their lipophilicity was propitious with the crossing of the blood-brain barrier (log k' > IAM > 1.35). The anticonvulsant activity of some of the best CA inhibitors reported here has been evaluated in a MES test in mice. After intraperitoneal injection (30 mg kg(-1)), compounds A8 and A9 exhibited a high protection against electrically induced convulsions (> 90%). Their ED50 was 3.5 and 2.6 mg kg(-1), respectively.
12175785	A heterozygote phenotype is present in the jvs +/- mutant mouse livers.	The juvenile visceral steatosis (jvs) mouse, having a mutation in the carnitine transporter gene Octn2, is a model of primary systemic carnitine deficiency in humans (SCD, OMIM 212140). Like humans with SCD, homozygous jvs -/- mice have hepatic and cardiac steatoses, reduced plasma and tissue carnitines, and increased urinary carnitine clearance. Because symptomatic heterozygotes have been reported for some fatty acid oxidation disorders, including SCD, we compared the jvs heterozygotes to normal control mice. We measured the free and esterified carnitine, total cholesterol, and triglycerides in adult liver samples, myocardium, and skeletal muscle. Our results indicate significant differences between the livers of nonfasting adult normal (n = 8) vs jvs heterozygotes (n = 8) (means +/- SEM, p < 0.01) for the following parameters: free carnitine, 2.28 +/- 0.36 nmol/mg protein vs 0.41 +/- 0.13; total carnitine, 3.48 +/- 0.36 vs 1.27 +/- 0.25; triglycerides, 0.14 +/- 0.04 vs 0.39 +/- 0.02; and total cholesterol, 0.21 +/- 0.02 vs 0.39 +/- 0.04, but not for esterified carnitine, 1.18 +/- 0.17 vs 0.90 +/- 0.17 (p > 0.05). There is also a negative correlation between hepatic free carnitine and triglycerides from jvs heterozygotes (p < 0.05). Similar results were obtained with myocardium and skeletal muscle. We conclude that free and total carnitine levels are significantly lower in the heterozygote mouse liver and heart while triglyceride and total cholesterol levels are significantly higher. We speculate that in situations of lipolytic stress, some SCD heterozygotes might develop clinical symptoms of carnitine deficiency.
15860753	Glucocorticoid receptor nuclear translocation in airway cells after inhaled combination therapy.	Clinical evidence is accumulating for the efficacy of adding inhaled long-acting beta(2)-agonists (LABAs) to corticosteroids in asthma. Corticosteroids bind to cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptors (GRs), which then translocate to the nucleus where they regulate gene expression. This article reports the first evidence in vivo of an interaction between inhaled LABA and corticosteroid on GR nuclear translocation in human airway cells using immunocytochemistry. We initially demonstrated significant GR activation 60 minutes after inhalation of 800 microg beclomethasone dipropionate in six healthy subjects. Subsequently, we determined the effects of salmeterol and fluticasone propionate (FP) in seven steroid-naive patients with asthma. We observed dose-dependent GR activation with 100- and 500-microg doses of FP, and to a lesser extent with 50 microg salmeterol alone. However, combination therapy with 100 microg FP and salmeterol augmented the action of FP on GR nuclear localization. In vitro, salmeterol enhanced FP effects on GR nuclear translocation in epithelial and macrophage-like airway cell lines. In addition, salmeterol in combination with FP enhanced glucocorticoid response element (GRE)-luciferase reporter gene activity and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP-1) and secretory leuko-proteinase inhibitor (SLPI) gene induction. Together, our data confirm that GR nuclear translocation may underlie the complementary interactions between LABAs and corticosteroids, although the precise signal transduction mechanisms remain to be determined.
17033106	Interaction of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) with Helicobacter pylori in the stomach of humans and experimental animals.	Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are major pathogenic factors in peptic ulcer disease but whether these two factors exert synergistic or antagonistic action on the gastric mucosa has been a subject of controversy. The classic concept states that there is an increased ulcer occurrence and bleeding in patients with both H. pylori infection and NSAID use. However, the question whether the H. pylori eradication therapy in NSAID users reduces the occurrence of peptic ulcer has not been fully addressed. Studies on secondary prevention of NSAID-associated ulcers in H. pylori patients have indicated that H. pylori eradication results in impaired ulcer healing with an effect on the rate of peptic ulcer occurrence. On the other hand, the treatment of H. pylori in patients with no prior history of chronic NSAID therapy has been shown to decrease the risk of peptic ulcer. Studies in experimental animals revealed for instance, that the H. pylori infection augments the gastric mucosal damage induced by NSAID in Mongolian gerbils. In rats with preexisting chromic gastric ulcers, H. pylori infection attenuated significantly the aspirin-induced inhibition of ulcer healing and accompanying fall in the gastric blood flow at the margin of these ulcers, suggesting negative interaction between aspirin and H. pylori on ulcerogenesis. Accumulated evidence in humans and animals shows that both aspirin and H. pylori upregulate the expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 both at mRNA and protein levels at the ulcer margin, but failed to influence significantly that of COX-1. It was, therefore, proposed that H. pylori may in fact, antagonize, aspirin-induced delay of ulcer healing due to suppression of acid secretion by the enhancement in PGE(2) possibly derived from COX-2 expression and activity and to the overexpression of growth factors such as TGF alpha and VEGF. The present review summarizes and further addresses the issue of the interaction between these two major ulcer risk factors determined in the stomach of humans and experimental animals.
2120879	Role of extracellular calcium and calmodulin in prolactin secretion induced by hyposmolarity, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, and high K+ in GH4C1 cells.	The mechanism by which 30% medium hyposmolarity induces PRL secretion by GH4C1 cells was compared with that induced by 100 nmol/l TRH or 30 mmol/l K+. Removing medium Ca2+, blocking Ca2+ channels with 50 mumol/l verapamil, or inhibiting calmodulin activation with 20 mumol/l trifluoperazine, 10 mumol/l chlorpromazine or 10 mumol/l pimozide almost completely blocked hyposmolarity-induced secretion. The smooth muscle relaxant, W-7, which is believed relatively specific in inhibiting the Ca2(+)-calmodulin interaction, depressed hyposmolarity-induced PRL secretion in a dose-dependent manner (r = -0.991, p less than 0.01). The above drugs also blocked or decreased high K(+)-induced secretion, but had much less effect on TRH-induced secretion. Secretion induced by TRH, hyposmolarity, or high K+ was optimal at pH 7.3-7.65 and was significantly depressed at pH 6.0 or 8.0, indicating that release of hormone induced by all 3 stimuli is due to an active cell process requiring a physiologic extracellular pH and is not produced by nonspecific cell toxicity. The data suggest hyposmolarity and high K+ may share some similarities in their mechanism of stimulating secretion, which is different from that of TRH.
23517733	Synthesis and selected immunological properties of substituted quino[3,2-b]benzo[1,4]thiazines.	A new type of azaphenothiazines - tetracyclic quino[3,2-b]benzo[1,4]thiazines, possessing common substituents (H, CH3, Cl, Br, F, CF3, SCH3) in positions 8-10 and pharmacophoric aminoalkyl substituents in position 6, were obtained from diquinodithiin and 2,2'-dichloro-3,3'-diquinolinyl disulfide in several-step syntheses. Sixty one compounds, grouped as the 6H, 6-dialkylaminoalkyl, 6-acylaminoalkyl and sulfonylaminoalkyl derivatives, were tested for cytotoxicity, their effects on phytohemagglutin A (PHA)-induced proliferative response of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) production by these cells. The compounds exhibited differential inhibitory activities in these tests and significantly varied in terms of cytotoxicity. The most promising compounds were tested for growth inhibition of leukemia L-1210 cells, colon cancer SV-948 cells and epidermal carcinoma A-341 cells. The most active compounds exhibited anticancer activity against these cell lines comparable to that of cisplatin. The structure-activity relationship of the compounds were discussed.
23297412	Resveratrol improves cardiomyopathy in dystrophin-deficient mice through SIRT1 protein-mediated modulation of p300 protein.	Cardiomyopathy is the main cause of death in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Here, we show that oral administration of resveratrol, which leads to activation of an NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylase SIRT1, suppresses cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis and restores cardiac diastolic function in dystrophin-deficient mdx mice. The pro-hypertrophic co-activator p300 protein but not p300 mRNA was up-regulated in the mdx heart, and resveratrol administration down-regulated the p300 protein level. In cultured cardiomyocytes, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by the α(1)-agonist phenylephrine was inhibited by the overexpression of SIRT1 as well as resveratrol, both of which down-regulated p300 protein levels but not p300 mRNA levels. In addition, activation of atrial natriuretic peptide promoter by p300 was inhibited by SIRT1. We found that SIRT1 induced p300 down-regulation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by deacetylation of lysine residues for ubiquitination. These findings indicate the pathological significance of p300 up-regulation in the dystrophic heart and indicate that SIRT1 activation has therapeutic potential for dystrophic cardiomyopathy.
23122096	Quantitative determination of fatty acid chain composition in pork meat products by high resolution 1H NMR spectroscopy.	High resolution (1)H NMR spectroscopy was proposed for the determination of the fatty acid chain profile of lipids in pork meat products during ripening. Two typical Mediterranean PDO salami produced in Calabria, a region in the Southern Italy, were chosen as a case of study. Quantitative NMR analysis provided the fatty acid chain profiles of total lipid extracts. The transesterification of total lipid extracts furnished FAME mixtures that enabled quantitation of fatty acid acyl chains in the acylglycerol and FFA portions. In all cases, oleyl chains were predominant, and high amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acid chains were observed. The proposed spectroscopic method allowed also the estimation of the most important nutritional parameters of dry fermented meat products.
23608241	The effect of mitragynine on cAMP formation and mRNA expression of mu-opioid receptors mediated by chronic morphine treatment in SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cell.	ETHOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Mitragynine is an indole alkaloid compound of Mitragyna speciosa (M. speciosa) Korth. (Rubiaceae). This plant is native to the southern regions of Thailand and northern regions of Malaysia and is frequently used to manage the withdrawal symptoms in both countries. AIM OF STUDY: To investigate the effect of mitragynine after chronic morphine treatment on cyclic AMP (cAMP) level and mRNA expression of mu-opioid receptor (MOR) in human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cell. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Mitragynine was isolated from the Mitragyna speciosa plant using the acid-base extraction method. The cAMP level upon forskolin stimulation in the cells was determined using the Calbiochem(®) Direct Immunoassay Kit. The mRNA expression of the MOR was carried out using quantitative RT-PCR. RESULT: Cotreatment and pretreatment of morphine and mitragynine significantly reduced the production of cAMP level at a lower concentration of nitrogen while the higher concentration of this compound could lead to the development of tolerance and dependence as shown by the increase of the cAMP level production in foskolin stimulation. In MOR mRNA expression study, cotreatment of morphine with mitragynine significantly reduced the down-regulation of MOR mRNA expression as compared to morphine treatment only. CONCLUSION: These finding suggest that mitragynine could possibly avoid the tolerance and dependence on chronic morphine treatment by reducing the up-regulation of cAMP level as well as reducing the down-regulation of MOR at a lower concentration of mitragynine.
9256165	Inhibition of extracellular release of proinflammatory secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) by sulfasalazine: a novel mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity.	Sulfasalazine is widely used in rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases. The mechanisms of its activity have not been elucidated. In leukocytes, sulfasalazine and its analogue, CL 42A, inhibited the formation of leukotrienes and possibly of the second messenger compounds at the level of phospholipase C. Partial inhibition of interleukin-lbeta (IL-1beta), IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was also found. Since the synthesis of eicosanoids is induced by phospholipase A2 and since secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) is proinflammatory, we investigated the impact of sulfasalazine and related compounds on mRNA, protein synthesis, and release of sPLA2 from osteoblasts. Sulfasalazine and CL 42A markedly inhibited extracellular release of sPLA2. The impact of sulfasalazine was evident at 50 microM (P < 0.001) and maximal at 400 microM, and that of CL 42A at 10 microM (P < 0.001) and 200 microM, respectively. Split products of sulfasalazine, 5-aminosalicylic acid (400 microM) and sulfapyridine (400 microM), had no impact. The effect of sulfasalazine and CL 42A was evident regardless of whether the cells were stimulated with IL-1beta/TNF-alpha, lipopolysaccharide/forskolin, or dibutyryl-cAMP. Sulfasalazine and CL 42A did not alter the level of sPLA2 mRNA. Exposure of stimulated fetal rat calvaria osteoblasts (FRCO) to sulfasalazine did not show accumulation of the intracellular sPLA2 protein as tested by western blot; however, enzymatic activity of PLA2 in disrupted cells was definitely increased. Thus, the impact is on the post-transcriptional release of sPLA2 rather than on the synthesis. There was also an increase in the extracellular release of prostaglandin E2 from FRCO exposed to sulfasalazine or to CL 42A. In contrast, sulfasalazine had no effect on the extracellular release of gelatinase from the cells or on mRNA of cytosolic PLA2 or cyclooxygenase 2. We conclude that the anti-inflammatory activity of sulfasalazine may be related, in part, to the selective inhibition of the extracellular release of proinflammatory sPLA2.
17512091	Downregulation of glutaredoxin but not glutathione loss leads to mitochondrial dysfunction in female mice CNS: implications in excitotoxicity.	Oxidative stress, excitotoxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction play synergistic roles in neurodegeneration. Maintenance of thiol homeostasis is important for normal mitochondrial function and dysregulation of protein thiol homeostasis by oxidative stress leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration. We examined the critical roles played by the antioxidant, non-protein thiol, glutathione and related enzyme, glutaredoxin in maintaining mitochondrial function during excitotoxicity caused by beta-N-oxalyl amino-L-alanine (L-BOAA), the causative factor of neurolathyrism, a motor neuron disease involving the pyramidal system. L-BOAA causes loss of GSH and inhibition of mitochondrial complex I in lumbosacral cord of male mice through oxidation of thiol groups, while female mice are resistant. Reducing GSH levels in female mice CNS by pretreatment with diethyl maleate or L-propargyl glycine did not result in inhibition of complex I activity, unlike male mice. Further, treatment of female mice depleted of GSH with L-BOAA did not induce inhibition of complex I indicating that GSH levels were not critical for maintaining complex I activity in female mice unlike their male counterpart. Glutaredoxin, a thiol disulfide oxidoreductase helps maintain redox status of proteins and downregulation of glutaredoxin results in loss of mitochondrial complex I activity. Female mice express higher levels of glutaredoxin in certain CNS regions and downregulation of glutaredoxin using antisense oligonucleotides sensitizes them to L-BOAA toxicity seen as mitochondrial complex I loss. Ovariectomy downregulates glutaredoxin and renders female mice vulnerable to L-BOAA toxicity as evidenced by activation of AP1, loss of GSH and complex I activity indicating the important role of glutaredoxin in neuroprotection. Estrogen protects against mitochondrial dysfunction caused by excitotoxicity by maintaining cellular redox status through higher constitutive expression of glutaredoxin in the CNS. Therapeutic interventions designed to upregulate glutaredoxin may offer neuroprotection against excitotoxicity in motor neurons.
23535287	Cajaninstilbene acid (CSA) exerts cytoprotective effects against oxidative stress through the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant pathway.	Cajaninstilbene acid (CSA), an active compound separated from pigeon pea leaves, possesses the highly efficient antioxidant activities. Transcription factor nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is an important regulator of cellular oxidative stress. This study examined the role of Nrf2 in CSA-mediated antioxidant effects on human hepatocarcinoma (HepG2) cell line. The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon H2O2 and CSA treatment was lower than that of H2O2 alone. CSA activated Nrf2 as evaluated by Western blotting. A luciferase reporter assay also demonstrated that CSA-activated signaling resulted in the increased transcriptional activity of Nrf2 through binding to the antioxidant response element (ARE) enhancer sequence. Our study indicated that treatment of HepG2 cells with CSA induces Nrf2-dependent ARE activity and gene expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunits by activation of PI3K/AKT, ERK and JNK signaling pathways. Inhibition of Nrf2 by siRNA reduced CSA-induced upregulation of these Nrf2-related enzymes. These results suggest that the Nrf2/ARE pathway plays an important role in the regulation of CSA-mediated antioxidant effects in HepG2 cells.
23583884	2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-induced inflammatory activation is mediated by intracellular free calcium in microglial cells.	2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) has been known to induce inflammatory signaling in a number of cell types and tissues. However, the adverse effects of TCDD on the central nervous system (CNS) have not been entirely elucidated. In this study, using reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and ELISA, we showed that TCDD up-regulated the expression and secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in a time-dependent manner in cultured HAPI microglial cells. TCDD also caused a fast (within 30min as judged by the increase in its mRNA level) activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). This initial action was accompanied by up-regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an important inflammation marker within 1h after TCDD treatment. These pro-inflammatory responses were inhibited by two types of Ca(2+) blockers, bis-(o-aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetra-acetic acid acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM) and nifedipine, thus, indicating that the effects are triggered by initial increase in the intracellular concentration of free Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]i). Further, TCDD exposure could induce phosphorylation- and ubiquitination-dependent degradation of IкBα, and the translocation of NF-κB p65 from the cytosol to the nucleus in this microglial cell line. Thus, the NF-κB signaling pathway can be activated after TCDD treatment. However, Ca(2+) blockers also obviously attenuated NF-κB activation and transnuclear transport induced by TCDD. In concert with these results, we highlighted that the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine and NF-κB activation induced by TCDD can be mediated by elevation of [Ca(2+)]i in HAPI microglial cells.
8991786	Effects of zonisamide on dopaminergic system.	Effects of zonisamide (ZNS) on extracellular dopamine (DA), its precursor 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), its metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) levels in the striatum as well as hippocampus of freely moving rats were studied. Intracellular DA, DOPA, DOPAC and HVA levels, as well as DOPA accumulation as an index of tyrosine hydroxylase activity in the rat brain in vivo, DA re-uptake in the striatum and hippocampus, and monoamine oxidase (MAO) activities were also determined. Acute administrations of therapeutic ZNS doses (20 and 50 mg/kg) increased striatal extracellular DOPA levels, intracellular striatal and hippocampal DOPA levels, and stimulated DOPA accumulation in both brain regions. ZNS also increased striatal and hippocampal intracellular as well as extracellular DA and HVA levels, but decreased those of DOPAC levels. Chronic (3 weeks) administrations of therapeutic ZNS doses (20 and 50 mg/kg/day) increased intracellular DA, DOPA, DOPAC and HVA levels in striatum and hippocampus. ZNS-induced changes were greater in intracellular levels than in extracellular levels. Acute and chronic supratherapeutic ZNS dose (100 mg/kg) administration decreased intracellular levels of all substances detectable in both brain regions, and inhibited DOPA accumulation. Both subtypes of MAO (type A and type B) activities were weakly inhibited by ZNS. ZNS showed no effect on DA re-uptake in striatum nor in hippocampus. These results suggest that therapeutic ZNS doses increase DOPA accumulation as well as both intracellular and extracellular DA, DOPA and HVA levels. However, such doses also decrease extracellular and intracellular DOPAC levels by enhancing DA synthesis and/or by selectively inhibiting MAO-B activities. In addition, chronic therapeutic ZNS dose administration enhances DA synthesis, which results in increased intracellular DA, its precursor and its metabolites levels. On the other hand, both acute and chronic supratherapeutic ZNS dose administrations inhibit DA turnover. These ZNS effects on DA metabolism are at least partly involved in the mechanisms of action of ZNS.
9631585	A case of therapy-related acute myeloblastic leukemia with t(16;21)(q24;q22) after chemotherapy with DNA-topoisomerase II inhibitors, etoposide and mitoxantrone, and the alkylating agent, cyclophosphamide.	A 59-year-old female suffering from malignant lymphoma developed therapy-related acute myeloblastic leukemia (t-AML) after chemotherapy consisting of treatment with DNA-topoisomerase II inhibitors, etoposide and mitoxantrone, and an alkylating agent, cyclophosphamide. The cumulative dose of etoposide administration was 5500 mg; 1500 mg given intravenously and 4000 mg orally. One year later, she suddenly developed AML of FAB M2. Cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow cells revealed deletion of 7q and a rare translocation, t(16;21)(q24;q22). Southern blot analysis of bone marrow cells did not detect rearrangement of the AML1 gene, however, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of bone marrow cells at interphase and metaphase revealed a translocational splitting between chromosome 21 involving AML1 gene and chromosome 16. These results suggest that the breakpoint is not located in the breakpoint cluster region for t(8;21). The patient was treated with chemotherapy and entered complete remission.
23381951	Pharmacogenetics of Allopurinol-Making an Old Drug Safer.	Allopurinol is a drug that has been used for decades to lower serum urate levels in patients with gout or chronic renal failure and in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy at risk of tumor lysis syndrome. Patients may develop cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions, ranging from mild rashes to potentially fatal severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) namely drug hypersensitivity syndrome, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Recent studies have demonstrated the association between human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B*58:01 allele and allopurinol-induced SCARs, which might explain ethnic differences in their incidences. Genotyping is now required before starting abacavir and carbamazepine so as to identify individuals susceptible to SJS. However, no genetic screening is advocated before commencement of allopurinol. The lack of availability of a rapid and inexpensive screening test for the HLA-B*58:01 allele is one of the obstacles to such screening. Development of a test that is quick, accurate, and cost-effective is warranted.
20387803	Measuring binding kinetics of ligands with tethered receptors by fluorescence polarization and total internal reflection fluorescence.	Binding kinetics of nuclear receptors and their specific ligands was measured using polarization anisotropy complemented with total internal reflection fluorescence. Binding affinities of tethered full length human estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) with 17beta-estradiol, diethylstilbestrol, raloxifene, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, tamoxifen, and genistein were measured to be 100 (as reference), 100, 35, 21, 8, and 1.5, respectively. They agreed with published results. For the first time, rate constants were measured, and off rates were 1.5, 1.5, 1.3, 1.6, 1.7, and 2.3 x 10(-3) s(-1) while on rates were 11, 10, 3.3, 2.4, 1.0, and 0.26 x 10(5) M(-1)s(-1), respectively. For the antiestrogen drugs, their comparable off-rates correlated well with their equally similar potency. Eleven ginsenosides were screened as potential ligands. None were found to bind to ERalpha, but Rb1(S) and 20(S)-Rg3 were shown to bind to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma. The latter finding corroborated strongly with the therapeutic effects of ginsenosides on diabetic mice observed in a separate study. Our method would complement surface plasmon resonance assay for small ligands in the mass range of tens to hundreds of Daltons.
23265191	Mammalian frataxin controls sulfur production and iron entry during de novo Fe4S4 cluster assembly.	Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster-containing proteins are essential components of cells. In eukaryotes, Fe-S clusters are synthesized by the mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) machinery and the cytosolic iron-sulfur assembly (CIA) system. In the mammalian ISC machinery, preassembly of the Fe-S cluster on the scaffold protein (ISCU) involves a cysteine desulfurase complex (NFS1/ISD11) and frataxin (FXN), the protein deficient in Friedreich's ataxia. Here, by comparing the biochemical and spectroscopic properties of quaternary (ISCU/NFS1/ISD11/FXN) and ternary (ISCU/NFS1/ISD11) complexes, we show that FXN stabilizes the quaternary complex and controls iron entry to the complex through activation of cysteine desulfurization. Furthermore, we show for the first time that in the presence of iron and L-cysteine, an [Fe(4)S(4)] cluster is formed within the quaternary complex that can be transferred to mammalian aconitase (mACO2) to generate an active enzyme. In the absence of FXN, although the ternary complex can assemble an Fe-S cluster, the cluster is inefficiently transferred to ACO2. Taken together, these data help to unravel further the Fe-S cluster assembly process and the molecular basis of Friedreich's ataxia.
16959378	Reduced plasma membrane surface expression of GLAST mediates decreased glutamate regulation in the aged striatum.	Extracellular L-glutamate poses a severe excitotoxic threat to neurons and glia when unregulated, therefore low synaptic levels of this neurotransmitter must be maintained via a rapid and robust transport system. A recent study from our laboratory showed a reduced glutamate uptake rate in the striatum of the aged Fischer 344 (F344) rat, yet the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is unknown. The current study utilized in vivo electrochemical recordings, immunoblotting and biotinylation in young (6 months), late-middle aged (18 months) and aged (24 months) F344 rats to elucidate the potential role that glutamate transporters (GLT-1, GLAST, and EAAC1) may play in this mechanism. Here we show that the time necessary to clear glutamate from the late-middle aged and aged striatum is significantly prolonged in comparison to the young striatum. In addition, an analysis of various sub-regions of the striatum revealed a marked dorsoventral gradient in terms of glutamate clearance times in the aged striatum, a phenomenon which was not present in the striatum of the animals of the remaining age groups. We also found that the decreased glutamate clearance time observed in the late-middle aged and aged rats is not due to a decrease in the production of total transporter protein among these three transporters. Rather, a significant reduction in the amount of GLAST expressed on the plasma membrane surface in the aged animals (approximately 55% when compared to young rats) may contribute to this phenomenon. These age-related alterations in extracellular l-glutamate regulation may be key contributors to the increased susceptibility of the aged brain to excitotoxic insults such as stroke and hypoxia.
19480470	Duloxetine: a review of its use in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder.	Duloxetine (Cymbalta(R)) is a potent serotonin and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) in the CNS. It is indicated for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) as well as other indications. In patients with GAD of at least moderate severity, oral duloxetine 60-120 mg once daily was effective with regard to improvement from baseline in assessments of anxiety and functional impairment, and numerous other clinical endpoints. Longer-term duloxetine 60-120 mg once daily also demonstrated efficacy in preventing or delaying relapse in responders among patients with GAD. In addition, duloxetine was generally well tolerated, with most adverse events being of mild to moderate severity in patients with GAD in short- and longer-term trials. Additional comparative and pharmacoeconomic studies are required to position duloxetine among other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and SNRIs. However, available clinical data, and current treatment guidelines, indicate that duloxetine is an effective first-line treatment option for the management of GAD. Duloxetine is a potent and selective inhibitor of serotonin and noradrenaline transporters, and a weak inhibitor of dopamine transporters. It has a low affinity for neuronal receptors, such as alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-adrenergic, dopamine D(2), histamine H(1), muscarinic, opioid and serotonin receptors, as well as ion channel binding sites and other neurotransmitter transporters, such as choline and GABA transporters. It does not inhibit monoamine oxidase types A or B. The pharmacokinetics of duloxetine in healthy volunteers were dose proportional over the range of 40-120 mg once daily. Steady state was typically reached by day 3 of administration. Duloxetine may be administered without regard to food or time of day. Duloxetine is highly protein bound and is widely distributed throughout tissues. It is rapidly and extensively metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 and 2D6, and its numerous metabolites, which are inactive, are mainly excreted in the urine. The mean elimination half-life of duloxetine is approximately 12 hours. Duloxetine is a substrate for CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 and a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6. Concomitant use of duloxetine and potent CYP1A2 inhibitors should be avoided and duloxetine should be used with caution in patients receiving drugs that are extensively metabolized by CYP2D6, particularly those with a narrow therapeutic index. Duloxetine was effective in the short-term treatment of patients with primary GAD of at least moderate severity. In four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, phase III trials, duloxetine 60-120 mg once daily for 9 or 10 weeks was significantly more effective than placebo with regard to the primary endpoint of mean change in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) total score from baseline to study endpoint. In addition, all other endpoints were generally improved from baseline to a greater extent with duloxetine 60-120 mg once daily than with placebo. Duloxetine also improved patient role functioning (assessed using Sheehan Disability Scale global impairment functioning scores), health-related quality of life and patient well-being compared with placebo. Duloxetine was effective in patients with GAD who were aged >/=65 years. Pooled results of data from the two short-term efficacy trials that also included an active comparator arm showed that the mean change in HAM-A scores with duloxetine relative to placebo were of the same magnitude as those with venlafaxine extended release versus placebo. Duloxetine 60-120 mg once daily was also more effective than placebo in preventing or delaying relapse in responders to duloxetine in a longer-term study. In this study, patients with GAD received duloxetine during a 26-week, open-label, acute treatment phase and responders were then randomized to continue on duloxetine or receive placebo during a 26-week, double-blind, continuation phase. Time to relapse was significantly longer in duloxetine recipients than in placebo recipients. In addition, significantly fewer duloxetine recipients than placebo recipients relapsed during the double-blind phase of the trial and more duloxetine recipients achieved remission. Short- (9-10 weeks) and longer-term (52 weeks) treatment with duloxetine 60-120 mg once daily was generally well tolerated in patients with GAD, with the majority of adverse events being of mild to moderate severity. Nausea, dry mouth, headache, constipation, dizziness and fatigue were among the most common treatment-emergent adverse events. The adverse event profile of duloxetine did not differ with dose or treatment duration. Significantly more patients receiving short-term duloxetine than placebo discontinued treatment because of an adverse event, with nausea being the only event that resulted in significantly more treatment discontinuations in duloxetine recipients than in placebo recipients. Serious adverse events were uncommon with both short- and longer-term duloxetine treatment. Two episodes of attempted suicide and one episode of completed suicide occurred in duloxetine recipients during the 24-week open-label phase of a longer-term trial. No deaths or suicides were reported in any of the short-term trials. Discontinuation-emergent adverse events, most commonly nausea and dizziness, occurred in up to one-third of duloxetine recipients in the short-term trials.
10362188	A multicenter, randomized study of argatroban versus heparin as adjunct to tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) in acute myocardial infarction: myocardial infarction with novastan and TPA (MINT) study.	OBJECTIVES: This study examined the effect of a small-molecule, direct thrombin inhibitor, argatroban, on reperfusion induced by tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). BACKGROUND: Thrombin plays a crucial role in thrombosis and thrombolysis. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that argatroban has advantages over heparin for the inhibition of clot-bound thrombin and for the enhancement of thrombolysis with TPA. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-five patients with AMI within 6 h were randomized to heparin, low-dose argatroban or high-dose argatroban in addition to TPA. The primary end point was the rate of thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) grade 3 flow at 90 min. RESULTS: TIMI grade 3 flow was achieved in 42.1% of heparin, 56.8% of low-dose argatroban (p = 0.20 vs. heparin) and 58.7% of high-dose argatroban patients (p = 0.13 vs. heparin). In patients presenting after 3 h, TIMI grade 3 flow was significantly more frequent in high-dose argatroban versus heparin patients: 57.1% versus 20.0% (p = 0.03 vs. heparin). Major bleeding was observed in 10.0% of heparin, and in 2.6% and 4.3% of low-dose and high-dose argatroban patients, respectively. The composite of death, recurrent myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock or congestive heart failure, revascularization and recurrent ischemia at 30 days occurred in 37.5% of heparin, 32.0% of low-dose argatroban and 25.5% of high-dose argatroban patients (p = 0.23). CONCLUSIONS: Argatroban, as compared with heparin, appears to enhance reperfusion with TPA in patients with AMI, particularly in those patients with delayed presentation. The incidences of major bleeding and adverse clinical outcome were lower in the patients receiving argatroban.
23047828	Circulating very-low-density lipoprotein from subjects with impaired glucose tolerance accelerates adrenocortical cortisol and aldosterone synthesis.	Apart from their role in cardiovascular homeostasis and immunomodulation, aldosterone and cortisol are also implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Furthermore, glycoxidative modifications of lipoproteins are increasingly recognized as an etiological factor for increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in prediabetic individuals. The causative relationship between in vivo lipoprotein modifications and steroidogenesis in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), however, is not well defined. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the impact of in vivo modified lipoproteins on aldosterone and cortisol release from human adrenocortical H295R cells. Following an oral glucose tolerance test, 20 individuals with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and 20 IGT subjects were randomly selected from the ongoing PRAEDIAS prevention study in our department. Cells were incubated for 24 h with lipoproteins isolated from NGT and IGT individuals and aldosterone and cortisol release was measured in the supernatants. VLDL induced a greater stimulating effect on adrenocortical aldosterone and cortisol release compared to HDL and LDL. Moreover, IGT-VLDL evoked a significantly higher effect (p<0.05) on hormone release than NGT-VLDL. Incubation of cells with in vitro modified lipoproteins and specific pharmacological inhibitors suggests that VLDL presumably recruits ERK1/2 as one of the downstream effectors of Jak-2. In summary, in vivo modified VLDL are able to promote prediabetic hormonal dysregulation by modulating adrenocortical steroidogenesis via Jak-2-ERK dependent pathway.
16647263	High-mannose-type glycan modifications of dihydrofolate reductase using glycan-methotrexate conjugates.	Various high-mannose-type glycan modifications of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) were achieved by ligand-based approach using glycan-methotrexate (MTX) conjugates as tight binding glycan bearing ligands for DHFR. The resulting glycan-MTX conjugates and the corresponding artificial glycoproteins could be useful as oligosaccharide- and glycoprotein-probes to perform quantitative analysis of glycan recognizing protein such as lectins, glycosyltransferases or glycosidases. Moreover, artificial glycoproteins having two different high-mannose-type glycans were developed for the first time by a combination of two different types of glycan modification strategies.
23404305	Predicting Macro- and Microvascular Complications in Type 2 Diabetes: The Japan Diabetes Complications Study/the Japanese Elderly Diabetes Intervention Trial risk engine.	OBJECTIVE To develop and validate a risk engine that calculates the risks of macro- and microvascular complications in type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We analyzed pooled data from two clinical trials on 1,748 Japanese type 2 diabetic patients without diabetes complications other than mild diabetic retinopathy with a median follow-up of 7.2 years. End points were coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, noncardiovascular mortality, overt nephropathy defined by persistent proteinuria, and progression of retinopathy. We fit a multistate Cox regression model to derive an algorithm for prediction. The predictive accuracy of the calculated 5-year risks was cross-validated. RESULTS Sex, age, HbA1c, years after diagnosis, BMI, systolic blood pressure, non-HDL cholesterol, albumin-to-creatinine ratio, atrial fibrillation, current smoker, and leisure-time physical activity were risk factors for macro- and microvascular complications and were incorporated into the risk engine. The observed-to-predicted (O/P) ratios for each event were between 0.93 and 1.08, and Hosmer-Lemeshow tests showed no significant deviations between observed and predicted events. In contrast, the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) risk engine overestimated CHD risk (O/P ratios: 0.30 for CHD and 0.72 for stroke). C statistics in our Japanese patients were high for CHD, noncardiovascular mortality, and overt nephropathy (0.725, 0.696, and 0.767) but moderate for stroke and progression of retinopathy (0.636 and 0.614). By combining macro- and microvascular risks, the classification of low- and high-risk patients was improved by a net reclassification improvement of 5.7% (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS The risk engine accurately predicts macro- and microvascular complications and would provide helpful information in risk classification and health economic simulations.
10683249	Characterization and partial purification of microsomal NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductases.	Quinone oxidoreductases are flavoproteins that catalyze two-electron reduction and detoxification of quinones. This leads to the protection of cells against toxicity, mutagenicity, and cancer due to exposure to environmental and synthetic quinones and its precursors. Two cytosolic forms of quinone oxidoreductases [NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and NRH:quinone oxidoreductase 2 (NQO2)] were previously identified, purified, and cloned. A role of cytosolic NQO1 in protection of cells from oxidative stress, cytotoxicity, and mutagenicity of quinones was established. Currently, we have characterized and partially purified the NQO activity from rat liver microsomes. This activity was designated as microsomal NQO (mNQO). The mNQO activity showed significantly higher affinity for NADH than NADPH as electron donors and catalyzed reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol and menadione. The mNQO activity was insensitive to dicoumarol, a potent inhibitor of cytosolic NQO1. Western analysis of microsomal proteins revealed 29- and 18-kDa bands that cross-reacted with polyclonal antibodies raised against cytosolic NQO1. The mNQO activity was partially purified by solubilization of microsomes with detergent Chaps, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and DEAE-Sephacel column chromatography. The microsomal mNQO proteins are expected to provide additional protection after cytosolic NQOs against quinone toxicity and mutagenicity.
17604186	Neuroprotective effect of nimesulide, a preferential COX-2 inhibitor, against pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced chemical kindling and associated biochemical parameters in mice.	Brain cyclooxygenases (COX), the rate-limiting enzyme in prostaglandin synthesis, is rapidly and transiently induced by convulsions in hippocampal and cortical neurons. Previous studies have explored the protective effect of naproxen (non-selective COX-inhibitor) or rofecoxib (selective COX-2 inhibitor) against chemical kindling in mice. With this background, the present study was designed to explore the possible effect of nimesulide (a preferential COX-2 inhibitor) against pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced kindling epilepsy in mice. To induce kindling, PTZ was injected in a subconvulsive dose (40 mg/kg, i.p.) every other day for 15 days. Nimesulide (2.5 or 5 mg/kg, p.o.) was administered each day 45 min before either PTZ or vehicle challenge. The intensity of kindling was assessed immediately after PTZ administration according to a prevalidated scoring scale. On 16th day i.e. 24 h after the last dose of PTZ, animals were sacrificed and various biochemical parameters were assessed in the whole brain. Compared with normal control group, PTZ-kindled mice had significantly higher levels of malondialdehyde, nitrite, myeloperoxidase but had lower levels of reduced glutathione in the whole brain homogenate. Chronic treatment with nimesulide (2.5 or 5 mg/kg, p.o.) for 15 days showed significant decrease in kindling score and could play a role in controlling the accompanying biochemical alterations due to PTZ. These results suggested that nimesulide, a preferential COX-2 inhibitor offered neuroprotection against PTZ-induced kindling in mice.
13129570	Synthesis and in vitro pharmacology at AMPA and kainate preferring glutamate receptors of 4-heteroarylmethylidene glutamate analogues.	2-Amino-3-[3-hydroxy-5-(2-thiazolyl)-4-isoxazolyl]propionic acid (1) is a potent AMPA receptor agonist with moderate affinity for native kainic acid (KA) receptors, whereas (S)-E-4-(2,2-dimethylpropylidene)glutamic acid (3) show high affinity for the GluR5 subtype of KA receptors and much lower affinity for the GluR2 subtype of AMPA receptors. As an attempt to develop new pharmacological tools for studies of GluR5 receptors, (S)-E-4-(2-thiazolylmethylene)glutamic acid (4a) was designed as a structural hybrid between 1 and 3. 4a was shown to be a potent GluR5 agonist and a high affinity ligand and to indiscriminately bind to the AMPA receptor subtypes GluR1-4 with lower affinities. Compounds 4b-h, in which the 2-thiazolyl substituent of 4a was replaced by other heterocyclic rings, which have previously been incorporated as 5-substituents in AMPA analogues, as exemplified by 1 were also synthesized. Compounds 4b-h were either inactive (4e,f) or weaker than 4a as affinity ligands for GluR1-4 and GluR5 with relative potencies comparable with those of the corresponding AMPA analogues as AMPA receptor agonists. Compounds 4a-h may be useful tools for the progressing pharmacophore mapping of the GluR5 agonist binding site.
22986217	Soy isoflavones modulate adipokines and myokines to regulate lipid metabolism in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver of male Huanjiang mini-pigs.	Although a growing body of evidence suggests that soy isoflavones help regulate lipid metabolism, the underlying mechanism has not yet been thoroughly clarified. The present study was undertaken to determine the effects of soy isoflavones on the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism in different adipose tissue depots, skeletal muscle and liver of male Huanjiang mini-pigs, as well as the expression of adipokines and myokines. A total of 36 male Huanjiang mini-pigs were fed basal diet (control, Con), low-dose soy isoflavones (LSI) and high-dose soy isoflavones (HSI). The results showed that LSI and HSI regulated the expression of genes involved in the anabolism and catabolism of fatty acids in dorsal subcutaneous (DSA), abdominal subcutaneous (ASA) and perirenal (PRA) adipose tissue depots, as well as longissimus dorsi muscle (LDM) and liver. LSI and HSI also regulated the expression of adipokines in DSA, ASA and PRA, and the expression of myokines in LDM in male Huanjiang mini-pigs. In addition, soy isoflavones regulated plasma glucose, leptin and adiponectin contents after treatment for two months. Our results indicate that soy isoflavones, by regulating the expression of adipokines and myokines, may regulate the metabolism of lipids and could have potential therapeutic applications in lipid abnormalities.
23378624	Pancreatic β-Cell Dysfunction and Risk of New-Onset Diabetes After Kidney Transplantation.	OBJECTIVEChronic exposure to calcineurin inhibitors and corticosteroids poses renal transplant recipients (RTR) at high risk for development of new-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT). Pancreatic β-cell dysfunction may be crucial to the pathophysiology of NODAT and specific markers for β-cell dysfunction may have additive value for predicting NODAT in this population. Therefore, we prospectively investigated whether proinsulin, as a marker of pancreatic β-cell dysfunction, is associated with future development of NODAT and improves prediction of it.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSAll RTR between 2001 and 2003 with a functioning graft for ≥1 year were considered eligible for inclusion, except for subjects with diabetes at baseline who were excluded. We recorded incidence of NODAT until April 2012.RESULTSA total of 487 RTR (age 50 ± 12 years, 55% men) participated at a median time of 6.0 (interquartile range [IQR], 2.6-11.5) years after transplantation. Median fasting proinsulin levels were 16.6 (IQR, 11.0-24.2) pmol/L. During median follow-up for 10.1 (IQR, 9.1-10.4) years, 42 (35%) RTR had development of NODAT in the highest quartile of the distribution of proinsulin versus 34 (9%) in the lowest three quartiles (P < 0.001). In Cox regression analyses, proinsulin (hazard ratio, 2.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.85-2.83; P < 0.001) was strongly associated with NODAT development. This was independent of age, sex, calcineurine inhibitors, prednisolone use, components of the metabolic syndrome, or homeostasis model assessment.CONCLUSIONSIn conclusion, fasting proinsulin is strongly associated with NODAT development in RTR. Our results highlight the role of β-cell dysfunction in the pathophysiology of NODAT and indicate the potential value of proinsulin for identification of RTR at increased risk for NODAT.
23345168	Blocking the proliferation of human tumor cell lines by peptidase inhibitors from Bauhinia seeds.	In cancer tumors, growth, invasion, and formation of metastasis at a secondary site play a pivotal role, participating in diverse processes in the development of the pathology, such as degradation of extracellular matrix. Bauhinia seeds contain relatively large quantities of peptidase inhibitors, and two Bauhinia inhibitors were obtained in a recombinant form from the Bauhinia bauhinioides species, B. bauhinoides cruzipain inhibitor, which is a cysteine and serine peptidase inhibitor, and B. bauhinioides kallikrein inhibitor, which is a serine peptidase inhibitor. While recombinant B. bauhinoides cruzipain inhibitor inhibits human neutrophil elastase cathepsin G and the cysteine proteinase cathepsin L, recombinant B. bauhinioides kallikrein inhibitor inhibits plasma kallikrein and plasmin. The effects of recombinant B. bauhinoides cruzipain inhibitor and recombinant B. bauhinioides kallikrein inhibitor on the viability of tumor cell lines with a distinct potential of growth from the same tissue were compared to those of the clinical cytotoxic drug 5-fluorouracil. At 12.5 µM concentration, recombinant B. bauhinoides cruzipain inhibitor and recombinant B. bauhinioides kallikrein inhibitor were more efficient than 5-fluorouracil in inhibiting MKN-28 and Hs746T (gastric), HCT116 and HT29 (colorectal), SkBr-3 and MCF-7 (breast), and THP-1 and K562 (leukemia) cell lines. Additionally, recombinant B. bauhinoides cruzipain inhibitor inhibited 40 % of the migration of Hs746T, the most invasive gastric cell line, while recombinant B. bauhinioides kallikrein inhibitor did not affect cell migration. Recombinant B. bauhinioides kallikrein inhibitor and recombinant B. bauhinoides cruzipain inhibitor, even at high doses, did not affect hMSC proliferation while 5-fluorouracil greatly reduced the proliferation rates of hMSCs. Therefore, both recombinant B. bauhinoides cruzipain inhibitor and recombinant B. bauhinioides kallikrein inhibitor might be considered for further studies to block peptidase activities in order to target specific peptidase-mediated growth and invasion characteristics of individual tumors, mainly in patients resistant to 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy.
23313730	The effect of manganese on dopamine toxicity and dopamine transporter (DAT) in control and DAT transfected HEK cells.	Chronic exposure to Mn results in the development of a neurological disorder known as manganism characterized by neurological deficits resembling that seen in Parkinsonism. Although dopaminergic neurons within the nigrostriatal pathway appear intact, Mn-induced irregularities in DA transmission have been observed including decreased amphetamine-induced DA release and loss of the dopamine transporter (DAT). Results of studies to evaluate the effect of Mn and DA on cell viability in control and DAT-transfected HEK cells reveal that Mn is equally toxic to both cell lines whereas DA was only toxic to cells containing DAT. DA toxicity was saturable suggesting that transport may be rate limiting. When Mn and DA were added simultaneously to the media, cell toxicity was similar to that produced by Mn alone suggesting that Mn may suppress DA uptake in the DAT containing cells. Preincubation of DA prior to the addition of Mn resulted in cell death which was essentially additive with that produced independently by the two agents. Mn was also shown to decrease DA uptake and amphetamine-induced DA efflux in DAT containing cells. Time-lapsed confocal microscopy indicates that Mn can promote trafficking of cell surface DAT into intracellular compartments which may account for the decrease in DA uptake and DA efflux in these cells. Mn-induced internalization of DAT may provide an explanation for disruption in DA transmission previously reported in the striatum.
10200266	The NDUFA1 gene product (MWFE protein) is essential for activity of complex I in mammalian mitochondria.	"The MWFE polypeptide of mammalian complex I (the proton-translocating NADH-quinone oxidoreductase) is 70 amino acids long, and it is predicted to be a membrane protein. The NDUFA1 gene encoding the MWFE polypeptide is located on the X chromosome. This polypeptide is 1 of approximately 28 ""accessory proteins"" identified in complex I, which is composed of 42 unlike subunits. It was considered accessory, because it is not one of the 14 polypeptides making up the core complex I; a homologous set of 14 polypeptides can make a fully functional proton-translocating NADH-quinone oxidoreductase in prokaryotes. One MWFE mutant has been identified and isolated from a collection of respiration-deficient Chinese hamster cell mutants. The CCL16-B2 mutant has suffered a deletion that would produce a truncated and abnormal MWFE protein. In these mutant cells, complex I activity is reduced severely (<10%). Complementation with hamster NDUFA1 cDNA restored the rotenone-sensitive complex I activity of these mutant cells to approximately 100% of the parent cell activity. Thus, it is established that the MWFE polypeptide is absolutely essential for an active complex I in mammals."
17653141	Influence of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 1173C/T genotype on the risk of hemorrhagic complications in African-American and European-American patients on warfarin.	The association of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 1173C/T genotype and risk of hemorrhage among African Americans and European Americans is presented. This association was evaluated using Cox proportional hazard regression with adjustment for demographics, comorbidity, and time-varying covariates. Forty-four major and 203 minor hemorrhages occurred over 555 person-years among 446 patients (60.6+/-15.6 years, 50% men, 227 African Americans). The variant CYP2C9 genotype conferred an increased risk for major (hazard ratio (HR) 3.0; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1-8.0) but not minor (HR 1.3; 95% CI: 0.8-2.1) hemorrhage. The risk of major hemorrhage was 5.3-fold (95% CI: 0.4-64.0) higher before stabilization of therapy, 2.2-fold (95% CI: 0.7-6.5) after stabilization, and 2.4-fold (95% CI: 0.8-7.4) during all periods when anticoagulation was not stable. The variant VKORC1 1173C/T genotype did not confer a significant increase in risk for major (HR 1.7; 95% CI: 0.7-4.4) or minor (HR 0.8; 95% CI: 0.5-1.3) hemorrhage. The variant CYP2C9 genotype is associated with an increased risk of major hemorrhage, which persists even after stabilization of therapy.
23164615	Differential modulation of retinal ganglion cell light responses by orthosteric and allosteric metabotropic glutamate receptor 8 compounds.	To investigate the role of mGluR8 in modulating the synaptic responses of retinal ganglion cells, we used a recently identified positive allosteric modulator of mGluR8, AZ12216052 (AZ) and the mGluR8-specific orthosteric agonist (S)-3,4-dicarboxyphenylglycine (DCPG). These agents were applied to whole-cell voltage-clamped ganglion cells from an isolated, superfused mouse retina preparation. DCPG reduced OFF-ganglion cell excitatory currents, whereas AZ enhanced the peak excitatory currents in ON-, OFF-, and ON-OFF-ganglion cells. The effects on ganglion cell inhibitory currents were more varied. The effects of the allosteric modulator were stronger for bright stimuli than for dim stimuli, consistent with receptor stimulation by endogenous glutamate being stronger during bright light stimulation and with mGluR8 receptors mainly being localized away from glutamate release sites, immuno-labeled with VGLUT1. The differential sensitivity of ganglion cell light responses to DCPG and AZ supports multiple sites where mGluR8 modulates the light responses of ganglion cells.
23104245	Comparative study of equimolar doses of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BD) and gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) on catalepsy after acute and chronic administration.	Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), and its precursors 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BD) and gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) are known drugs of abuse. The ability of acute and chronic administration of equimolar doses of GHB (200mg/kg), 1,4-BD (174mg/kg) and GBL (166mg/kg) to produce catalepsy in male Swiss Webster mice was examined. GHB, 1,4-BD, GBL produced catalepsy when injected acutely. Drug treatment was then continued for 14days. Tolerance development was determined on days 6, 14, and challenged with a higher dose on day 15 in those chronically pretreated mice, and compared with naïve mice. Chronic GHB produced tolerance to catalepsy, as evidenced from area under the curve (AUC) of catalepsy versus time (min-sec) on days 6 (678±254), 14 (272±247), which were less than those on day 1 (1923±269). However, less tolerance was seen from GBL or 1,4-BD, as AUCs on days 6 and 14 were not significantly lower than that of day 1. In conclusion, although equimolar doses were used, expecting similar levels of GHB in the body, 1,4-BD and GBL shared only some of the in vivo effects of GHB. The rate of metabolic conversion of 1,4-BD and GBL into GHB might be responsible for the differences in the tolerance development to these drugs.
23274907	Permanent Neonatal Diabetes in INSC94Y Transgenic Pigs.	Mutations in the insulin (INS) gene may cause permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM). Ins2 mutant mouse models provided important insights into the disease mechanisms of PNDM but have limitations for translational research. To establish a large animal model of PNDM, we generated INS(C94Y) transgenic pigs. A line expressing high levels of INS(C94Y) mRNA (70-86% of wild-type INS transcripts) exhibited elevated blood glucose soon after birth but unaltered β-cell mass at the age of 8 days. At 4.5 months, INS(C94Y) transgenic pigs exhibited 41% reduced body weight, 72% decreased β-cell mass (-53% relative to body weight), and 60% lower fasting insulin levels compared with littermate controls. β-cells of INS(C94Y) transgenic pigs showed a marked reduction of insulin secretory granules and severe dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum. Cataract development was already visible in 8-day-old INS(C94Y) transgenic pigs and became more severe with increasing age. Diabetes-associated pathological alterations of kidney and nervous tissue were not detected during the observation period of 1 year. The stable diabetic phenotype and its rescue by insulin treatment make the INS(C94Y) transgenic pig an attractive model for insulin supplementation and islet transplantation trials, and for studying developmental consequences of maternal diabetes mellitus.
1322791	Amsacrine and etoposide hypersensitivity of yeast cells overexpressing DNA topoisomerase II.	Increasing the cellular concentration of DNA topoisomerase II in yeast by expressing constitutively a plasmid-borne TOP2 gene encoding the enzyme greatly increases the sensitivity of the cells to amsacrine and etoposide (VP-16). This increased drug sensitivity at a higher intracellular DNA topoisomerase II level is observed in both RAD52+ repair-proficient strains and rad52 mutants that are defective in the repair of double-stranded breaks. These results provide strong support of the hypothesis that the cellular target of these drugs is DNA topoisomerase II, and that these drugs kill cells by converting DNA topoisomerase II into a DNA damaging agent.
17016711	Different responses to dexamethasone and prednisolone in the same depressed patients.	RATIONALE: Patients with major depression show hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyperactivity, but the mechanisms underlying this abnormality are still unclear. OBJECTIVES: We have compared two synthetic glucorticoids, dexamethasone and prednisolone, in their ability to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in depressed patients. Dexamethasone probes glucocorticoid receptor (GR) function, while prednisolone probes both GR and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) function. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a single-blind, repeated-measure design. We administered placebo, prednisolone (5 mg) or dexamethasone (0.5 mg), at 22:00, to 18 severe, treatment-resistant depressed inpatients (15 of them with a history of childhood trauma) and 14 healthy volunteers. On the following days, we collected salivary cortisol from 9:00 to 22:00. RESULTS: Depressed patients had higher salivary cortisol levels compared with controls, at baseline and after both prednisolone and dexamethasone (p<0.001). Consistent with previous studies, depressed inpatients showed impaired suppression by dexamethasone: based on the analysis of the areas under the curve (AUCs), suppression by dexamethasone (0.5 mg) was -85% in controls vs -46% in depressed patients (p=0.018). However, the same depressed patients showed normal suppression by prednisolone (5 mg): suppression was -41% in controls and -36% in depressed patients (p=0.6). CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that the additional effects of prednisolone on the MR explain the different responses to these glucocorticoids in the same depressed patients.
23212963	Adsorption of phenanthrene, 2-naphthol, and 1-naphthylamine to colloidal oxidized multiwalled carbon nanotubes: effects of humic acid and surfactant modification.	Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can exist in the form of colloidal suspension in aquatic environments, particularly in the presence of natural organic matter or surfactants, and may significantly affect the fate and transport of organic contaminants. In the present study, the authors examined the adsorption of phenanthrene, 2-naphthol, and 1-naphthylamine to three colloidal CNTs, including a stable suspension of oxidized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (O-MWNT), a humic acid (HA)-modified colloidal O-MWNT, and a sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-modified colloidal O-MWNT. All three colloidal O-MWNTs exhibit strong adsorption affinities to the three test compounds (with K(OC) values orders of magnitude greater than those of natural organic matter), likely resulting from strong nonhydrophobic interactions such as π-π electron donor-acceptor interactions and Lewis acid-base interactions. When thoroughly mixed, HA (at ∼310 mg HA/g CNT) and SDS (at ∼750 mg SDS/g CNT) significantly affected the aggregation properties of O-MWNT, causing individually dispersed tubes to form a loosely entangled network. The effects of HA or SDS modification on adsorption are twofold. Adsorption of HA/SDS significantly reduces surface areas of O-MWNT; however, the entangled network allows adsorbate molecules to interact simultaneously with multiple tubes. An important implication is that humic substances and surfactant-like materials not only facilitate the formation of colloidal carbon nanoparticles but also affect how these colloidal carbon nanoparticles adsorb organic contaminants.
16781459	Hydrogen sulfide inhibits nitric oxide production and nuclear factor-kappaB via heme oxygenase-1 expression in RAW264.7 macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide.	Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S), a regulatory gaseous molecule that is endogenously synthesized by cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) and/or cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) from L-cysteine (L-Cys) metabolism, is a putative vasodilator, and its role in nitric oxide (NO) production is unexplored. Here, we show that at noncytotoxic concentrations, H(2)S was able to inhibit NO production and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression via heme oxygenase (HO-1) expression in RAW264.7 macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Both H(2)S solution prepared by bubbling pure H(2)S gas and NaSH, a H(2)S donor, dose dependently induced HO-1 expression through the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Pretreatment with H(2)S or NaHS significantly inhibited LPS-induced iNOS expression and NO production. Moreover, NO production in LPS-stimulated macrophages that are expressing CSE mRNA was significantly reduced by the addition of L-Cys, a substrate for H(2)S, but enhanced by the selective CSE inhibitor beta-cyano-L-alanine but not by the CBS inhibitor aminooxyacetic acid. While either blockage of HO activity by the HO inhibitor, tin protoporphyrin IX, or down-regulation of HO-1 expression by HO-1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) reversed the inhibitory effects of H(2)S on iNOS expression and NO production, HO-1 overexpression produced the same inhibitory effects of H(2)S. In addition, LPS-induced nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation was diminished in RAW264.7 macrophages preincubated with H(2)S. Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of H(2)S on NF-kappaB activation was reversed by the transient transfection with HO-1 siRNA, but was mimicked by either HO-1 gene transfection or treatment with carbon monoxide (CO), an end product of HO-1. CO treatment also inhibited LPS-induced NO production and iNOS expression via its inactivation of NF-kappaB. Collectively, our results suggest that H(2)S can inhibit NO production and NF-kappaB activation in LPS-stimulated macrophages through a mechanism that involves the action of HO-1/CO.
18220763	Type 2 diabetes and oral antihyperglycemic drugs.	Type II diabetes is a heterogeneous disease where environment and genetics are important factors for the expression of the disease. The high cost for treating complications of diabetes is a burden for public health systems and governments worldwide. Type II diabetes has been causing debilitation worldwide for many decades, and a single drug that safely treats the disease has yet to be discovered. Sulfonylureas, biguanides, alpha-glucosidase, meglitinides, DPP-4 inhibitors and thiazolidinediones are among the classes of oral hypoglycemic drugs available to treat Type II diabetes, but concerns exist regarding safety and efficacy of these drugs. In this article we present the pros and cons of the six classes and discuss some of the latest advances towards the development of new drugs for the treatment of Type II diabetes.
17260025	A chemical biology approach identifies a beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist that causes human tumor regression by blocking the Raf-1/Mek-1/Erk1/2 pathway.	A chemical biology approach identifies a beta 2 adrenergic receptor (beta2AR) agonist ARA-211 (Pirbuterol), which causes apoptosis and human tumor regression in animal models. beta2AR stimulation of cAMP formation and protein kinase A (PKA) activation leads to Raf-1 (but not B-Raf) kinase inactivation, inhibition of Mek-1 kinase and decreased phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk)1/2 levels. ARA-211 inhibition of the Raf/Mek/Erk1/2 pathway is mediated by PKA and not exchange protein activated by cAMP (EPAC). ARA-211 is selective and suppresses P-Erk1/2 but not P-JNK, P-p38, P-Akt or P-STAT3 levels. beta2AR stimulation results in inhibition of anchorage-dependent and -independent growth, induction of apoptosis in vitro and tumor regression in vivo. beta2AR antagonists and constitutively active Mek-1 rescue from the effects of ARA-211, demonstrating that beta2AR stimulation and Mek kinase inhibition are required for ARA-211 antitumor activity. Furthermore, suppression of growth occurs only in human tumors where ARA-211 induces cAMP formation and decreases P-Erk1/2 levels. Thus, beta2AR stimulation results in significant suppression of malignant transformation in cancers where it blocks the Raf-1/Mek-1/Erk1/2 pathway by a cAMP-dependent activation of PKA but not EPAC.
12244074	TNF-alpha increases the carbohydrate sulfation of CD44: induction of 6-sulfo N-acetyl lactosamine on N- and O-linked glycans.	CD44 and sulfation have both been implicated in leukocyte adhesion. In monocytes, the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) stimulates CD44 sulfation, and this correlates with the induction of CD44-mediated adhesion events. However, little is known about the sulfation of CD44 or its induction by inflammatory cytokines. We determined that TNF-alpha induces the carbohydrate sulfation of CD44. CD44 was established as a major sulfated cell surface protein on myeloid cells. In the SR91 myeloid cell line, the majority of CD44 sulfation was attributed to the glycosaminoglycan chondroitin sulfate. However, TNF-alpha stimulation increased CD44 sulfation two- to threefold, largely attributed to the increased sulfation of N- and O-linked glycans on CD44. Therefore, TNF-alpha induced a decrease in the percentage of CD44 sulfation due to chondroitin sulfate and an increase due to N- and O-linked sulfation. Furthermore, TNF-alpha induced the expression of 6-sulfo N-acetyl lactosamine (LacNAc)/Lewis x on these cells, which was detected by a monoclonal antibody after neuraminidase treatment. This 6-sulfo LacNAc/Lewis x epitope was induced on N-linked and (to a lesser extent) on O-linked glycans present on CD44. This demonstrates that CD44 is modified by sulfated carbohydrates in myeloid cells and that TNF-alpha modifies both the type and amount of carbohydrate sulfation occurring on CD44. In addition, it demonstrates that TNF-alpha can induce the expression of 6-sulfo N-acetyl glucosamine on both N- and O-linked glycans of CD44 in myeloid cells.
16916952	Bovine and ovine gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-II ligand precursors and type II GnRH receptor genes are functionally inactivated.	The decapeptide sequence of GnRH-II is conserved in all jawed vertebrate species studied to date. New data for cattle (Bos taurus) indicates a gene encoding GnRH-II decapeptide possessing arginine (codon: CGG) rather than tryptophan (TGG) at position three in the mature peptide. This substitution is unique. We confirmed the DNA sequence after cloning part of the bovine prepro-GnRH-II gene. Bovine GnRH-II peptide was synthesized and pharmacologically characterized. It did not bind to mammalian GnRH receptors expressed in different types of cell nor did it exhibit agonist or antagonist properties on types I or II GnRH receptors expressed in COS-7 cells. Bovine primers facilitated cloning of ovine GnRH-II DNA. A premature stop codon (TGA) replaces the expected tryptophan codon at position seven of GnRH-II in sheep DNA. Thus, both species possess prepro-GnRH-II genes encoding inactive peptides, as previously described for chimpanzee GnRH-II. The updated bovine type II GnRH receptor gene sequence revealed inactivation by frame shifts, premature stop codons, and nucleotide changes specifying nonconservative replacement of amino acid residues, similar to inactivation of sheep type II GnRH receptor. Spliced RNA transcripts from the disrupted receptor gene were not detected in bovine pituitary. In contrast, bovine prepro-GnRH-I and type I GnRH receptor genes are intact, encoding well-conserved protein sequences. These findings, and previous descriptions of inactivation of the human type II GnRH receptor and deletions of prepro-GnRH-II and type II GnRH receptor in laboratory rodents, suggest the GnRH-II system has been replaced by the GnRH-I system or is redundant in certain mammals.
11587223	Sulfasalazine, a potent suppressor of lymphoma growth by inhibition of the x(c)- cystine transporter: a new action for an old drug.	Although cyst(e)ine is nutritionally a non-essential amino acid, lymphoid cells cannot synthesize it, rendering their growth dependent on uptake of cyst(e)ine from their microenvironment. Accordingly, we previously suggested that the x(c)- plasma membrane cystine transporter provided a target for lymphoid cancer therapy. Its inhibition could lead to cyst(e)ine deficiency in lymphoma cells via reduction of both their cystine uptake and cysteine supply by somatic cells. In this study, using rat Nb2 lymphoma cultures, drugs were screened for growth arrest based on x(c)- inhibition. Sulfasalazine was fortuitously found to be a novel, potent inhibitor of the x(c)- transporter. It showed high rat lymphoma growth-inhibitory and lytic activity in vitro (IC50 = 0.16 mM), based specifically on inhibition of x(c)--mediated cystine uptake, in contrast to its colonic metabolites, sulfapyridine and 5-aminosalicylic acid. Sulfasalazine was even more effective against human non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (DoHH2) cultures. In rats (n = 13), sulfasalazine (i.p.) markedly inhibited growth of well-developed, rapidly growing rat Nb2 lymphoma transplants without apparent side-effects. Reduced, macrophage-mediated supply of cysteine was probably involved. In five rats, 90-100% tumor growth suppression, relative to controls, was obtained. The x(c)- cystine transporter represents a novel target for sulfasalazine-like drugs with high potential for application in therapy of lymphoblastic and other malignancies dependent on extracellular cyst(e)ine.
12897089	Oxidative stress-related factors in Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes: relevance for angiotensin II signalling.	BACKGROUND: Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes (BS/GS) have a blunted Gq protein-mediated cell signalling despite high circulating angiotensin II (Ang II) levels. This is associated with reduced Galphaq gene expression, intracellular inositol trisphosphate and Ca(++) release, PKC activity and cell reactivity. Ang II is a powerful stimulator of vascular oxidases but BS/GS patients show reduced total volatile LDL oxidation products and reduced LDL susceptibility to oxidation suggesting low level of oxidative stress. Therefore, we evaluated oxidative stress-related proteins in plasma and monocytes of patients with BS/GS, at baseline and after Ang II stimulation. METHODS: In two BS and seven GS patients, biochemically and genetically characterized, and in 10 age- and sex-matched control subjects, we measured total plasma antioxidant power (AOP), plasma peroxynitrite level and gene expression of the NADH/NADPH oxidase subunit p22(phox), TGFbeta and haeme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in circulating monocytes in basal condition and after stimulation with Ang II. Furthermore, we investigated the C(242)T polymorphism of p22(phox), whose topography in a potential haeme-binding site suggests a role in the regulation of oxidative stress. RESULTS: AOP was higher in BS/GS patients than in controls (3.27 +/- 0.95 mmol/l vs 1.05 +/- 0.16, P = 0.002), together with higher plasma renin activity and aldosterone level (9.88 +/- 4.64 vs 0.95 +/- 0.08 nmol Ang I/h/ml, P < 0.0001; and 0.73 +/- 0.13 vs 0.18 +/- 0.01 nmol/l, P < 0.0001, respectively). The plasma peroxynitrite level was undetectable both in patients and controls. mRNA expression of p22(phox) and TGFbeta was reduced in BS/GS patients compared to controls [0.35 +/- 0.08 vs 0.53+/-0.05 densitometric units (d.u.), P = 0.005, and 0.82 +/- 0.07 vs 1.15 +/- 0.25 d.u., P = 0.006, respectively]. HO-1 mRNA was increased in BS/GS patients in comparison to controls (0.88 +/- 0.07 vs 0.78 +/- 0.11 d.u., P = 0.037). After acute Ang II exposure, p22(phox), TGFbeta and HO-1 gene expression significantly increased only in controls (from 0.59 +/- 0.12 to 0.96 +/- 0.11, P < 0.001, from 0.97 +/- 0.1 to 1.27 +/- 0.22, P < 0.008, and from 0.62 +/- 0.1 to 0.82 +/- 0.09, P < 0.001, respectively). Finally, C(242)T polymorphism of p22(phox) was undetectable. CONCLUSIONS: The intracellular responses to Ang II mediated by reactive oxygen species are reduced in BS/GS patients. This may contribute to their vascular hyporeactivity.
23581551	Design, Synthesis, and Structure-Activity Relationship Studies of Novel 3-Alkylindole Derivatives as Selective and Highly Potent Myeloperoxidase Inhibitors.	Due to its production of potent antimicrobial oxidants including hypochlorous acid, human myeloperoxidase (MPO) plays a critical role in innate immunity and inflammatory diseases. Thus MPO is an attractive target in drug design. (Aminoalkyl)fluoroindole derivatives were detected to be very potent MPO inhibitors; however, they also promote inhibition of the serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) at the same concentration range. Via structure-based drug design, a new series of MPO inhibitors derived from 3-alkylindole were synthesized and their effects were assessed on MPO-mediated taurine chlorination and low-density lipoprotein oxidation as well as on inhibition of SERT. The fluoroindole compound with three carbons in the side chain and one amide group exhibited a selectivity index of 35 (Ki/IC50) with high inhibition of MPO activity (IC50 = 18 nM), whereas its effect on SERT was in the micromolar range. Structure-function relationships, mechanism of action, and safety of the molecule are discussed.
18465538	Flavopiridol Hoechst AG.	Hoechst is developing flavopiridol, a synthetic flavonoid based on an extract from an Indian plant, for the potential treatment of cancer. Flavopiridol, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, arrests cell division and causes apoptosis in non-small lung cancer cells [283660]. A phase II trial, in collaboration with the National Cancer Institute, has commenced at the University of Chicago Medical Center, which involves patients with high or intermediate-grade lymphoma or multiple myeloma [272937], [277372]. In ex vivo experiments with tumor cells from refractory chronic lymphoblastic leukemia, dose-dependent CDK2 inhibition associated with apoptotic changes was seen at concentrations greater than 100 nM of flavopiridol. In vitro pharmacokinetic studies have shown that flavopiridol undergoes hepatic biotransformation to its corresponding glucoronide by uridine diphosphate glucoronosyltransferases [283791]. Flavopiridol inhibits CDK with an IC50 value of 0.4 mM [285707]. Preclinical toxicology studies in rats and dogs demonstrated dose-related leukopenia and drug-related lesions in the thymus, spleen and bone marrow. The gastrointestinal and bone marrow toxicity was dose-limiting [178579]. Hoechst Marion Roussel expects to launch flavopiridol in the year 2001, with potential sales in excess of DM 750 million [288651].
23389862	Phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors augment the ability of formoterol to enhance glucocorticoid-dependent gene transcription in human airway epithelial cells: a novel mechanism for the clinical efficacy of roflumilast in severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.	"Post-hoc analysis of two phase III clinical studies found that the phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor, roflumilast, reduced exacerbation frequency in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who were taking inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) concomitantly, whereas patients not taking ICS derived no such benefit. In contrast, in two different trials also performed in patients with severe COPD, roflumilast reduced exacerbation rates in the absence of ICS, indicating that PDE4 inhibition alone is sufficient for therapeutic activity to be realized. Given that roflumilast is recommended as an ""add-on"" medication to patients with severe disease who will inevitably be taking a long-acting β2-adrenoceptor agonist (LABA)/ICS combination therapy, we tested the hypothesis that roflumilast augments the ability of glucocorticoids to induce genes with anti-inflammatory activity. Using a glucocorticoid response element (GRE) luciferase reporter transfected into human airway epithelial cells [both bronchial epithelium + adenovirus 12 - SV40 hybrid (BEAS-2B) cells and primary cultures], roflumilast enhanced fluticasone propionate-induced GRE-dependent transcription. Roflumilast also produced a sinistral displacement of the concentration-response curves that described the augmentation of GRE-dependent transcription by the LABA formoterol. In BEAS-2B cells and primary airway epithelia, roflumilast interacted with formoterol in a positive cooperative manner to enhance the expression of several glucocorticoid-inducible genes that have anti-inflammatory potential. We suggest that the ability of roflumilast and formoterol to interact in this way supports the concept that these drugs together may impart clinical benefit beyond that achievable by an ICS alone, a PDE4 inhibitor alone, or an ICS/LABA combination therapy. Roflumilast may, therefore, be especially effective in patients with severe COPD."
9056052	Initial human experience with MK-462 (rizatriptan): a novel 5-HT1D agonist.	AIMS: We evaluated the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral MK-462 in comparison with oral sumatriptan in healthy male volunteers. METHODS: Sixteen healthy male volunteers were studied in a rising, single dose, alternating panel design with eight subjects per panel. Matching placebo was administered to two of eight study subjects at each dose level of MK-462 in a randomized, double-blind fashion. RESULTS: MK-462 was rapidly absorbed with a median tmax of 1.3 h (range 1-3 h) vs a tmax for sumatriptan of 2.5 h (range 1-4 h, P < 0.001). Administration of either MK-462 or sumatriptan produced maximal mean elevations of 5-10 mmHg in systolic and diastolic blood pressures without effect on heart rate; the changes occurred sooner following MK-462, consistent with more rapid absorption. Both MK-462 and sumatriptan provoked mild increases in serum growth hormone without any effect on serum prolactin concentrations. The most commonly reported symptom following MK-462 was drowsiness. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the novel 5-HT1D agonist, MK-462, is rapidly absorbed following oral administration and warrants further investigation of its utility in the treatment of acute migraine.
12504917	Pharmacological properties of the anti-Parkinson drug rasagiline; modification of endogenous brain amines, reserpine reversal, serotonergic and dopaminergic behaviours.	Rasagiline [N-propargyl-1R(+)-aminoindan; TVP1012] is a potent irreversible monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor with selectivity for type B of the enzyme, which is being developed for treatment of Parkinson's disease. In this study we examined effects of rasagiline on CNS monoamine levels, modification of behavioural response to L-tryptophan, fluoxetine and L-DOPA, and reversal of reserpine syndrome. Reserpine-induced ptosis was reversed by rasagiline at doses above 2 mg x kg(-1) i.p., which inhibit MAO-A as well as MAO-B, but not at MAO-B-selective doses. However, combination of rasagiline (10 mg x kg(-1) i.p.) with L-DOPA or L-tryptophan (50 mg x kg(-1) i.p.), or rasagiline (10 mg x kg(-1) p.o.) with fluoxetine (10 mg x kg(-1) p.o.), did not induce the behavioural hyperactivity syndrome which is seen following inhibition of both MAO-A and MAO-B by tranylcypromine together with the monoamine precursors. Following oral administration, levels of noradrenaline (NA), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) were unaffected in hippocampus and striatum after single doses of rasagiline up to 2 mg x kg(-1). Following chronic oral administration (21 days, one dose daily), levels of NA, 5-HT and DA in hippocampus and striatum were unaffected by rasagiline at doses up to 1 mg x kg(-1). Rasagiline does not modify CNS monoamine tissue levels or monoamine-induced behavioural syndromes at doses which selectively inhibit MAO-B but not MAO-A.
23384447	Northern contaminant mixtures induced morphological and functional changes in human coronary artery endothelial cells under culture conditions typifying high fat/sugar diet and ethanol exposure.	It has been reported that Northern populations are exposed to mixtures of various environmental contaminants unique to the Arctic (Northern contaminant mixtures - NCM) at a large range of concentrations, depending on their geological location, age, lifestyle and dietary habits. To determine if these contaminants may contribute to a cardiovascular health risk, especially when combined with a high fat and sugar diet and ethanol exposure, we treated human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) with two mixtures of 4 organic (NCM1) or 22 organic and inorganic (NCM2) chemicals detected in Northerners' blood during 2004-2005 in the presence or absence of low-density lipoprotein (1.5mg/ml), very-low-density lipoprotein (1.0mg/ml) and glucose (10mmol/L) (LVG), and in the absence or presence of 0.1% ethanol. After 24h of exposure, cell morphology and markers of cytotoxicity and endothelial function were examined. NCM1 treatment did not affect cell viability, but increased cell size, disrupted cell membrane integrity, and decreased cell density, uptake of small peptides, release of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI), while causing no changes in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) protein expression and nitric oxide (NO) release. In contrast, NCM2 decreased cell viability, total protein yield, uptake of small peptides, eNOS protein expression, and NO release and caused membrane damage, but caused no changes in the secretion of ET-1, prostacyclin and PAI. The presence of LVG and/or alcohol did or did not influence the effects of NCM1 or NCM2 depending on the endpoint and the mixture examined. These results suggested that the effects of one or one group of contaminants may be altered by the presence of other contaminants, and that with or without the interaction of high fat and sugar diet and/or ethanol exposure, NCMs at the concentrations used caused endothelial dysfunction in vitro. It remains to be investigated if these effects of NCMs also occur in vivo.
23122079	Phillyrin attenuates high glucose-induced lipid accumulation in human HepG2 hepatocytes through the activation of LKB1/AMP-activated protein kinase-dependent signalling.	Phillyrin, an active constituent found in many medicinal plants and certain functional foods, has anti-obesity activity in vivo. The aim of our study was to provide new data on the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the role of phillyrin in the prevention of high glucose-induced lipid accumulation in human HepG2 hepatocytes. We found that phillyrin suppressed high glucose-induced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. Phillyrin strongly inhibited high glucose-induced fatty acid synthase (FAS) expression by modulating sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) activation. Moreover, use of the pharmacological AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor compound C revealed that AMPK is essential for suppressing SREBP-1c expression in phillyrin-treated cells. Finally, we found that liver kinase B1 (LKB1) phosphorylation is required for the phillyrin-enhanced activation of AMPK in HepG2 hepatocytes. These results indicate that phillyrin prevents lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells by blocking the expression of SREBP-1c and FAS through LKB1/AMPK activation, suggesting that phillyrin is a novel AMPK activator with a role in the prevention and treatment of obesity.
23194529	The presence of D-fagomine in the human diet from buckwheat-based foodstuffs.	Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) groats contain the iminosugar D-fagomine as a minor component that might contribute to the alleged health benefits of this pseudo-cereal. This study presents analysis of D-fagomine in buckwheat-based foodstuffs by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and an estimation of its presence in the human diet based on a published population-based cross-sectional nutrition survey. D-fagomine is present in common buckwheat-based foodstuffs in amounts ranging from 1 to 25 mg/kg or mg/L, it is stable during boiling, baking, frying and fermentation, and it is biosynthesised upon sprouting. The estimated total intake of D-fagomine resulting from a diet that includes such foodstuffs would be between 3 and 17 mg per day (mean for both genders; range from P5 to P95). A diet rich in buckwheat products would provide a daily amount of D-fagomine that may in part explain the beneficial properties traditionally attributed to buckwheat consumption.
23512824	Recruiting the Host's Immune System to Target Helicobacter pylori's Surface Glycans.	Due to the increased prevalence of bacterial strains that are resistant to existing antibiotics, there is an urgent need for new antibacterial strategies. Bacterial glycans are an attractive target for new treatments, as they are frequently linked to pathogenesis and contain distinctive structures that are absent in humans. We set out to develop a novel targeting strategy based on surface glycans present on the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori (Hp). In this study, metabolic labeling of bacterial glycans with an azide-containing sugar allowed selective delivery of immune stimulants to azide-covered Hp. We established that Hp's surface glycans are labeled by treatment with the metabolic substrate peracetylated N-azidoacetylglucosamine (Ac4 GlcNAz). By contrast, mammalian cells treated with Ac4 GlcNAz exhibited no incorporation of the chemical label within extracellular glycans. We further demonstrated that the Staudinger ligation between azides and phosphines proceeds under acidic conditions with only a small loss of efficiency. We then targeted azide-covered Hp with phosphines conjugated to the immune stimulant 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP), a compound capable of directing a host immune response against these cells. Finally, we report that immune effector cells catalyze selective damage in vitro to DNP-covered Hp in the presence of anti-DNP antibodies. The technology reported herein represents a novel strategy to target Hp based on its glycans.
9677387	58K, a microtubule-binding Golgi protein, is a formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase.	58K was previously identified as a rat liver protein that binds microtubules in vitro and is associated with the cytoplasmic surface of the Golgi apparatus in vivo (Bloom, G. S., and Brashear, T. A. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 16083-16092). We now report that 58K is a formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase (FTCD), a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes two consecutive steps in the modification of tetrahydrofolate to 5,10-methenyl tetrahydrofolate. Comparative immunoblotting using several monoclonal antibodies made against 58K and a polyclonal antibody made against a chicken liver protein (p60) with similar properties (Hennig, D., Scales, S. J., Moreau, A., Murley, L. L., De Mey, J., and Kreis, T. E. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 19602-19611) demonstrated precise co-purification of protein recognized by all antibodies through multiple fractionation steps, including gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography, and sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. Eight peptides derived from 58K showed high sequence identity to amino acid sequences predicted by full length cDNA for p60 and porcine liver FTCD. Furthermore, purified 58K was associated with formiminotransferase and cyclodeaminase activities. Based on these collective results, 58K was concluded to be a rat liver version of FTCD. Microtubules assembled from brain tubulin, but not from liver tubulin, were able to bind rat liver FTCD. Binding to brain microtubules is suspected to occur via polyglutamates that are added post-translationally to tubulin in brain, which was shown to contain very low levels of FTCD, but not to tubulin in liver, which was determined to be the richest tissue source, by far, of FTCD. The physiological significance of the microtubule binding activity of FTCD is thus called into question, but an association of FTCD with the Golgi apparatus has now been established.
23620660	Profile of certolizumab and its potential in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis.	Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory arthropathy associated with psoriasis (PsO). PsA could be considered an enthesal disease because of the link between mechanical stress (entheses) and immunologically active tissue (synovium). Evidence of efficacy of anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is supported by reduction of histological vascularity and immune cell infiltrates in synovial tissue after treatment. Certolizumab pegol (CZP) is a polyethylene glycolylated (PEGylated) Fab' fragment of a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds and neutralizes human TNF-alpha. The PEG moiety of the Fab fragment, markedly increases the half-life of CZP and confers to the drug a unique structure that differs from the other anti-TNF-alpha agents tested for the treatment of Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis, nonradiographic spondyloarthritis, PsO, and PsA. In contrast to other anti-TNF-alpha agents, CZP did not mediate increased levels of apoptosis, suggesting that these mechanisms are not essential for the anti-TNF-alpha efficacy in Crohn's disease. As CZP, infliximab, and adalimumab, but not etanercept, almost completely inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-1 beta release from monocytes, this cytokine-production inhibition may be relevant for drug efficacy. Due to these characteristics, it has been demonstrated in clinical studies that CZP effectively improves signs and symptoms of arthritis and physical function and skin manifestations of PsO, with a safety profile similar to rheumatoid arthritis. This drug can be considered as a valid treatment in patients affected by PsA. The efficacy and tolerability profiles suggest CZP as a suitable antipsoriatic drug in the treatment of PsA.
23468189	Benzenesulfonamides: a unique class of chemokine receptor type 4 inhibitors.	The interaction of CXCR4 with CXCL12 (SDF-1) plays a critical role in cancer metastasis by facilitating the homing of tumor cells to metastatic sites. Based on our previously published work on CXCR4 antagonists, we have synthesized a series of aryl sulfonamides that inhibit the CXCR4/CXCL12 interaction. Analogue bioactivities were assessed with binding affinity and Matrigel invasion assays. Computer modeling was employed to evaluate a selection of the new analogues docked into the CXCR4 X-ray structure and to rationalize discrepancies between the affinity and Matrigel in vitro assays. A lead compound displays nanomolar potency in the binding affinity assay (IC(50)=8.0 nM) and the Matrigel invasion assay (100 % blockade of invasion at 10 nM). These data demonstrate that benzenesulfonamides are a unique class of CXCR4 inhibitors with high potency.
23419388	Danshen mediates through estrogen receptors to activate Akt and inhibit apoptosis effect of Leu27IGF-II-induced IGF-II receptor signaling activation in cardiomyoblasts.	Post-menopausal women show dramatically increased cardiovascular disease morbidity (CVD). Danshen is used widely in China for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders, including coronary heart disease. Danshen possesses lipid-soluble biologically active components with a structure similar to 17β-estrodiol (E2). This study assesses whether the cardio-protection exerted by Danshen is mediated through the ERs within H9c2 cardiomyoblast cells. Cardiomyoblast cells pretreated with Fulvestrant (ICI 182,780), an estrogen receptor antagonist was applied to investigate the estrogenic activity of Danshen. The Danshen extract preventive effects on Leu27IGF-II-induced IGF-IIR signaling activator and H9c2 cell apoptosis were identified using TUNEL assay, JC-1 staining and Western blot assay. We found that Danshen extract treatments significantly enhanced phosphorylated Akt through estrogen receptor activation to inhibit Leu27IGF-II-induced calcineurin activation and block H9c2 cell apoptosis. Danshen extracts suppressed the IGF-IIR signaling proteins, pro-apoptotic proteins and reversed the mitochondrial membrane instability induced by Leu27IGF-II. However, the cardioprotective properties of Danshen to inhibit Leu27IGF-II-induced cell apoptosis and promote cell survival were attenuated by applying ICI, which suggests that the Danshen cardioprotective effect is mediated through estrogen receptors. All our data indicated that Danshen exerts strong estrogenic activity which can be considered a novel selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) against IGF2R signaling that blocks cardiac apoptosis.
21143836	ASIC3 channels integrate agmatine and multiple inflammatory signals through the nonproton ligand sensing domain.	BACKGROUND: Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) have long been known to sense extracellular protons and contribute to sensory perception. Peripheral ASIC3 channels represent natural sensors of acidic and inflammatory pain. We recently reported the use of a synthetic compound, 2-guanidine-4-methylquinazoline (GMQ), to identify a novel nonproton sensing domain in the ASIC3 channel, and proposed that, based on its structural similarity with GMQ, the arginine metabolite agmatine (AGM) may be an endogenous nonproton ligand for ASIC3 channels. RESULTS: Here, we present further evidence for the physiological correlation between AGM and ASIC3. Among arginine metabolites, only AGM and its analog arcaine (ARC) activated ASIC3 channels at neutral pH in a sustained manner similar to GMQ. In addition to the homomeric ASIC3 channels, AGM also activated heteromeric ASIC3 plus ASIC1b channels, extending its potential physiological relevance. Importantly, the process of activation by AGM was highly sensitive to mild acidosis, hyperosmolarity, arachidonic acid (AA), lactic acid and reduced extracellular Ca2+. AGM-induced ASIC3 channel activation was not through the chelation of extracellular Ca2+ as occurs with increased lactate, but rather through a direct interaction with the newly identified nonproton ligand sensing domain. Finally, AGM cooperated with the multiple inflammatory signals to cause pain-related behaviors in an ASIC3-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Nonproton ligand sensing domain might represent a novel mechanism for activation or sensitization of ASIC3 channels underlying inflammatory pain-sensing under in vivo conditions.
23414292	Bifunctional electrophiles cross-link thioredoxins with redox relay partners in cells.	Thioredoxin protects cells against oxidative damage by reducing disulfide bonds in improperly oxidized proteins. Previously, we found that the baker's yeast cytosolic thioredoxin Trx2 undergoes cross-linking to form several protein-protein complexes in cells treated with the bifunctional electrophile divinyl sulfone (DVSF). Here, we report that the peroxiredoxin Tsa1 and the thioredoxin reductase Trr1, both of which function in a redox relay network with thioredoxin, become cross-linked in complexes with Trx2 upon DVSF treatment. Treatment of yeast with other bifunctional electrophiles, including diethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (DAD), mechlorethamine (HN2), and 1,2,3,4-diepoxybutane (DEB), resulted in the formation of similar cross-linked complexes. Cross-linking of Trx2 and Tsa1 to other proteins by DVSF and DAD is dependent on modification of the active site Cys residues within these proteins. In addition, the human cytosolic thioredoxin, cytosolic thioredoxin reductase, and peroxiredoxin 2 form cross-linked complexes to other proteins in the presence of DVSF, although each protein shows different susceptibilities to modification by DAD, HN2, and DEB. Taken together, our results indicate that bifunctional electrophiles potentially disrupt redox homeostasis in yeast and human cells by forming cross-linked complexes between thioredoxins and their redox partners.
15689518	Crystal structure of the pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-dependent serine dehydratase from human liver.	L-serine dehydratase (SDH), a member of the beta-family of pyridoxal phosphate-dependent (PLP) enzymes, catalyzes the deamination of L-serine and L-threonine to yield pyruvate or 2-oxobutyrate. The crystal structure of L-serine dehydratase from human liver (hSDH) has been solved at 2.5 A-resolution by molecular replacement. The structure is a homodimer and reveals a fold typical for beta-family PLP-dependent enzymes. Each monomer serves as an active unit and is subdivided into two distinct domains: a small domain and a PLP-binding domain that covalently anchors the cofactor. Both domains show the typical open alpha/beta architecture of PLP enzymes. Comparison with the rSDH-(PLP-OMS) holo-enzyme reveals a large structural difference in active sites caused by the artifical O-methylserine. Furthermore, the activity of hSDH-PLP was assayed and it proved to show catalytic activity. That suggests that the structure of hSDH-PLP is the first structure of the active natural holo-SDH.
10823899	Amphetamine-induced loss of human dopamine transporter activity: an internalization-dependent and cocaine-sensitive mechanism.	The dopamine transporter (DAT) is a target of amphetamine (AMPH) and cocaine. These psychostimulants attenuate DAT clearance efficiency, thereby increasing synaptic dopamine (DA) levels. Re-uptake rate is determined by the number of functional transporters at the cell surface as well as by their turnover rate. Here, we present evidence that DAT substrates, including AMPH and DA, cause internalization of human DAT, thereby reducing transport capacity. Acute treatment with AMPH reduced the maximal rate of [(3)H]DA uptake, decreased AMPH-induced currents, and significantly redistributed the immunofluorescence of an epitope-tagged DAT from the plasma membrane to the cytosol in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Conversely, DAT inhibitors, such as cocaine, mazindol, and nomifensine, when administered with AMPH, blocked the reduction in [(3)H]DA uptake and the redistribution of DAT immunofluorescence to the cytosol. The reductions of [(3)H]DA uptake and AMPH-induced DAT internalization also were inhibited by coexpression of a dominant negative mutant of dynamin I (K44A), indicating that endocytosis modulates transport capacity, likely through a clathrin-mediated pathway. With this mechanism of regulation, acute application of AMPH would reduce DA uptake not only by direct competition for uptake, but also by reducing the available cell-surface DAT. Moreover, AMPH-induced internalization might diminish the amount of DAT available for DA efflux, thereby modulating the cytotoxic effects of elevated extracellular DA.
15673388	Further insights into the effect of quinidine in short QT syndrome caused by a mutation in HERG.	"INTRODUCTION: The principal aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of quinidine in suppressing IKr in vitro and in modulating the rate dependence of the QT interval in the ""SQT1"" form of the short QT syndrome. METHODS AND RESULTS: Graded-intensity bicycle exercise testing was performed off drug in three patients and during oral quinidine in two patients with short QT syndrome and compared to a control group of healthy normal subjects. The in vitro effects of quinidine on currents in patch clamp technique were investigated. Off drugs QTpV3/heart rate correlation is much weaker in patients with short QT syndrome, and QTpV3 shortens less with heart rate increase compared to normal subjects. In addition to prolonging the QT interval into the normal range, quinidine restored the heart rate dependence of the QT interval toward a range of adaptation reported for normal subjects. Data from heterologous expression of wild-type and mutant HERG genes indicate the mutation causes a 20-fold increase in IC50 of d-sotalol but only a 5.8-fold increase in IC50 of quinidine. CONCLUSION: Oral quinidine is effective in suppressing the gain of function in IKr responsible for some cases of short QT syndrome with a mutation in HERG and thus restoring normal rate dependence of the QT interval and rendering ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation noninducible."
15206110	Gallium and other main group metal compounds as antitumor agents.	Gallium has been the second metal to show activity against malignant tumors in humans soon after the establishment of platinum drugs in routine clinical practice. It has the unique property of inhibiting tumor growth as a simple cation, mainly because of its close resemblance to ferric iron. Even though its inability to shift between the trivalent and a divalent oxidation state precludes that gallium behaves as an iron analogue in every respect, it strongly interferes with cellular acquisition of iron from blood by competitive interaction with transferrin and transferrin receptor-mediated endocytosis. Furthermore, gallium also seems to affect intracellular availability of iron already taken up via this pathway, probably due to its inhibitory activity on vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPases. Apart from the consequences of iron deprivation, gallium exerts cytotoxic effects by direct interaction with the iron-dependent enzyme ribonucleotide reductase, resulting in reduced dNTP pools and inhibition of DNA synthesis. Both the abundance of transferrin receptors and upregulation of ribonucleotide reductase render tumors susceptible to gallium-induced cytotoxicity. However, some experimental findings raise the question whether these effects resulting from the iron-mimicking properties of gallium are solely responsible for its antineoplastic activity or whether additional mechanisms are involved, such as antimitotic effects which result from its capability of inhibiting tubulin polymerization. The limitations experienced with gallium nitrate and gallium chloride, which call for a prolonged exposure to low steady-state gallium levels in blood in order to adequately exploit the affinity of gallium to tumor tissues and to avoid severe toxic effects, may be overcome by oral gallium complexes such as tris(3-hydroxy-2-methyl-4H-pyran-4-onato)gallium(III) (gallium maltolate) or tris(8-quinolinolato)gallium(III) (KP46), which are currently being evaluated in clinical trials and show promise to initiate a revival of gallium in the clinical setting. These two investigational drugs, albeit differing in their complex stability, have both been developed with the intention of providing gallium in a form which allows sufficient intestinal absorption, but without altering its pharmacodynamic effects. Gallium complexes based on other rationales are scarce and, with regard to the well-known antineoplastic potential of this metal, noticeably under-explored. With the recent approval of arsenic trioxide for the second-line treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia, the clinical revival of arsenic compounds, which have been the mainstay of antileukemic therapy before the age of modern cancer chemotherapy, has already begun. Currently, strong efforts are being made to explore the activity spectrum in other (less rare) malignancies and to gain a deeper insight into the mode of action. Although this development is currently focusing on arsenic trioxide, it should be suited to stimulate investigations into the therapeutic potential of other arsenic compounds as well.
18336310	The development of topically acting carbonic anhydrase inhibitors as antiglaucoma agents.	Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1) isoforms present in the eyes (CA I, II, IV and XII), with sulfonamides such as acetazolamide, methazolamide, ethoxzolamide and dichlorophenamide, is still widely used for the systemic treatment of glaucoma. The mechanism of action of these drugs consists in inhibition of CA isozymes present in ciliary processes of the eye, with the consequent reduction of bicarbonate and aqueous humour secretion, and of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) characteristic of this disease. As isoforms CA II/IV/XII are present in many other tissues/organs, generally, systemic CAIs possess undesired side effects such as numbness and tingling of extremities; metallic taste; depression; fatigue; malaise; weight loss; decreased libido; gastrointestinal irritation; metabolic acidosis; renal calculi and transient myopia. For avoiding these side effects, recently, topically effective CAIs have been developed in the last 10 years, with two drugs available clinically: dorzolamide and brinzolamide. Both these drugs are applied topically as water solutions/suspensions, alone or in combination with other agents (beta-blockers, prostaglandin derivatives, etc) and produce a consistent and prolonged reduction of IOP. Furthermore, recent reports show both the systemically as well as topically acting sulfonamide CAIs to be effective in the treatment of macular edema, macular degeneration disease, or diabetic retinopathy, for which pharmacological treatment is unavailable up to now. Much research is in act in the search of more effective topically acting CAIs, free of the inconveniences and side effects of the presently available drugs. For achieving this goal, two recently reported strategy, the tail approach and its variant, the sugar-tail approach, were extensively applied for the synthesis of large numbers of derivatives possessing desired physico-chemical properties. Many such new sulfonamides showed promising antiglaucoma activity in animal models of the disease.
23494944	Influence of the Green Tea Leaf Extract on Neurotoxicity of Aluminium Chloride in Rats.	Aluminium may have an important role in the aetiology/pathogenesis/precipitation of Alzheimer's disease. Because green tea (Camellia sinensis L.) reportedly has health-promoting effects in the central nervous system, we evaluated the effects of green tea leaf extract (GTLE) on aluminium chloride (AlCl3 ) neurotoxicity in rats. All solutions were injected into the cornu ammonis region 1 hippocampal region. We measured the performance of active avoidance (AA) tasks, various enzyme activities and total glutathione content (TGC) in the forebrain cortex (FbC), striatum, basal forebrain (BFb), hippocampus, brain stem and cerebellum. AlCl3 markedly reduced AA performance and activities of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in all regions. It decreased TGC in the FbC, striatum, BFb, hippocampus, brain stem and cerebellum, and increased superoxide dismutase activity in the FbC, cerebellum and BFb. GTLE pretreatment completely reversed the damaging effects of AlCl3 on AA and superoxide dismutase activity, markedly corrected COX and AChE activities, and moderately improved TGC. GTLE alone increased COX and AChE activities in almost all regions. GTLE reduces AlCl3 neurotoxicity probably via antioxidative effects and improves mitochondrial and cholinergic synaptic functions through the actions of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate and (-)-epicatechin, compounds most abundantly found in GTLE. Our results suggest that green tea might be beneficial in Alzheimer's disease. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
23210776	New molecular and cellular targets for chemoprevention and treatment of skin tumors by plant polyphenols: a critical review.	As the incidence of skin tumors has been steadily growing, there is an urgent need for the preventive measures as well as the improved therapeutic approaches. In the last two decades, natural plant derived polyphenols (PPs, resveratrol, silibinin, green tea polyphenols, flavonoids, anthocyanins, etc.) have been drawing particular interest as emerging active substances in dermatological/cosmeceutical compositions for the prevention, slowing, or reversion of skin tumorigenesis (chemoprevention). When chronically applied to the skin, they supposedly would not damage normal skin cells or negatively affect their functions while they would suppress tumorigenic cell transformation, inhibit tumor cell proliferation, and activate tumor cell apoptosis. PPs are also reported to synergize with conventional anti-cancer therapies. The major aim of this critical review is to provide recent updates on the molecular and cellular targets for the prevention and therapy of skin tumors with a special focus on the crossroad between inflammation and carcinogenesis as the most promising approach to chemoprevention. Novel therapeutic targets as different as epidermal stem cells, cellular senescence, epigenetic enzymes involved in carcinogenesis, epidermal growth factor and aryl hydrocarbon receptors, and metabolic CYP1 subfamily enzymes are highlighted. The mechanisms of PPs interaction with these molecular and cellular targets are reviewed. The feasibility of PPs to prevent/ cure specific cutaneous toxicity connected to anti-EGFR therapy and to reduce multidrug resistance of skin tumors is also discussed.
11839626	Clinical and molecular heterogeneity in the Brugada syndrome: a novel gene locus on chromosome 3.	BACKGROUND: Brugada syndrome is a form of idiopathic ventricular fibrillation characterized by a right bundle-branch block pattern and ST elevation (STE) in the right precordial leads of the ECG. Sodium channel blockers increase STE. Mutations of the cardiac sodium channel SCN5A cause the disorder, and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is often recommended for affected individuals. Mutations in other genes have not been identified, and it is not known if the efficacy of drug testing or the malignancy of arrhythmias correlates to the gene defect. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed histories, physical examinations, ECGs, and drug testing on a large multigenerational family with Brugada syndrome. DNA isolated from blood samples, polymorphic genomic markers, and polymorphisms within candidate sodium channels were used for a genome-wide screen, fine mapping, and linkage analysis. We identified 12 affected individuals (right bundle-branch block, > or =1-mm STE) with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern characterized by incomplete penetrance that appeared to be dependent on age and sex. Four affected individuals had syncope and 2 had documented ventricular arrhythmias, but there was minimal family history of sudden death. Procainamide infusions did not identify additional affected individuals. Linkage was present to an approximately equal 15-cM region on chromosome 3p22-25 (maximum LOD score=4.00). The sodium channel genes SCN5A, SCN10A, and SCN12A on chromosome 3 were excluded as candidates (LOD scores < or =-2). CONCLUSIONS: A Brugada syndrome locus distinct from SCN5A is associated with progressive conduction disease, a low sensitivity to procainamide testing, and a relatively good prognosis in a single large pedigree.
17394052	Dopamine genes and pathological gambling in discordant sib-pairs.	Pathological gambling (PG) is an impulse control disorder that has been considered as a behavioral addiction. Recent studies have suggested the involvement of the dopaminergic system in addictions and impulse control disorders and associations of dopamine receptor genes (DRD1, DRD2, and DRD4) and PG have been reported. In the present study, 140 sib-pairs discordant for the diagnosis of PG (70 males and 70 females on each group) were recruited through the Gambling Outpatient Unit at the Institute of Psychiatry, University of Sao Paulo and were assessed by trained psychiatrists. A family-based association design was chosen to prevent population stratification. All subjects were genotyped for dopamine receptor genes (DRD1 -800 T/C, DRD2 TaqIA RFLP, DRD3 Ser9Gly, DRD4 48bp exon III VNTR, DRD5 (CA) repeat) and the dopamine transporter gene (SCL6A3 40 bp VNTR). Our results suggest the association of PG with DRD1 -800 T/C allele T (P = .03).
23461378	Dissecting the relative contribution of OATP1B1-mediated uptake of xenobiotics into human hepatocytes using siRNA.	Abstract 1. Organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 plays a pivotal role in the disposition of many anionic drugs. Significant overlap in substrate specificity between individual OATP isoforms has hampered the identification of the relative importance of individual isoforms for hepatic uptake of xenobiotics. 2. The present study focused on the use of siRNA technology to decrease OATP1B1 selectively in human hepatocytes. Following delivery of siRNA by the novel lipid, AtuFECT01, mRNA expression of OATP1B1 was reduced by 94%-98% with no significant toxicity. Off-target effects were also shown to be minimal as evidenced by the expression of common drug metabolizing enzymes, transporters, nuclear receptors and associated co-regulators. Uptake of estrone-3-sulfate (5 nM) by OATP1B1 was reduced by 82%-95%. This methodology was subsequently used to assess the relative contribution of OATP1B1 uptake in human hepatocytes for olmesartan (42%-62%), valsartan (28%-81%), rosuvastatin (64%-72%), pitavastatin (84%-98%) and lopinavir (64%-89%). These data are consistent with previous values obtained using a relative activity factor approach. 3. The siRNA approach provides a robust and reproducible method for assessing the relative contribution of OATP1B1 to hepatic uptake of new chemical entities. The technique also has potential utility in facilitating detailed characterization of drug-drug interactions involving hepatic drug transporters.
17664139	Sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter isoforms in skin: Distribution, kinetics, and effect of UVB-induced oxidative stress.	Two sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter isoforms (SVCT1 and SVCT2) were identified as ascorbic acid transporters, but their roles in skin have, as yet, not been elucidated. Here we analyze the expression and function of SVCTs in healthy human skin cells and skin tissues, and in UVB-induced cutaneous tissue injury. SVCT1 was primarily found in the epidermis expressed by keratinocytes, whereas SVCT2 expression was in the epidermis and dermis in keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Uptake experiments revealed that ascorbic acid affinity of SVCT1 was lower than SVCT2 (K(m)=75 muM and K(m)=44 muM, respectively), but maximal velocity was 9-times higher (36 nmol/min/well). In keratinocytes, SVCT1 was found to be responsible for vitamin C transport, although SVCT2 gene expression was higher. On UVB irradiation, SVCT1 mRNA expression in murine skin declined significantly in a time- and dose-dependent manner, whereas SVCT2 mRNA levels were unchanged. Furthermore, UVB irradiation of keratinocytes in vitro was accompanied by reduced ascorbic acid transport. In summary, these data indicate that the two vitamin C transporter isoforms fulfill specific functions in skin: SVCT1 is responsible for epidermal ascorbic acid supply, whereas SVCT2 mainly facilitates ascorbic acid transport in the dermal compartment. UVB-induced oxidative stress in mice resulted in depletion of SVCT1 mRNA levels and led to significantly decreased ascorbic acid uptake in keratinocytes, providing evidence on why ascorbic acid levels are decreased on UVB irradiation in vivo.
22935616	Noncanonical control of C. elegans germline apoptosis by the insulin/IGF-1 and Ras/MAPK signaling pathways.	The insulin/IGF-1 pathway controls a number of physiological processes in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, including development, aging and stress response. We previously found that the Akt/PKB ortholog AKT-1 dampens the apoptotic response to genotoxic stress in the germline by negatively regulating the p53-like transcription factor CEP-1. Here, we report unexpected rearrangements to the insulin/IGF-1 pathway, whereby the insulin-like receptor DAF-2 and 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase PDK-1 oppose AKT-1 to promote DNA damage-induced apoptosis. While DNA damage does not affect phosphorylation at the PDK-1 site Thr350/Thr308 of AKT-1, it increased phosphorylation at Ser517/Ser473. Although ablation of daf-2 or pdk-1 completely suppressed akt-1-dependent apoptosis, the transcriptional activation of CEP-1 was unaffected, suggesting that daf-2 and pdk-1 act independently or downstream of cep-1 and akt-1. Ablation of the akt-1 paralog akt-2 or the downstream target of the insulin/IGF-1 pathway daf-16 (a FOXO transcription factor) restored sensitivity to damage-induced apoptosis in daf-2 and pdk-1 mutants. In addition, daf-2 and pdk-1 mutants have reduced levels of phospho-MPK-1/ERK in their germ cells, indicating that the insulin/IGF-1 pathway promotes Ras signaling in the germline. Ablation of the Ras effector gla-3, a negative regulator of mpk-1, restored sensitivity to apoptosis in daf-2 mutants, suggesting that gla-3 acts downstream of daf-2. In addition, the hypersensitivity of let-60/Ras gain-of-function mutants to damage-induced apoptosis was suppressed to wild-type levels by ablation of daf-2. Thus, insulin/IGF-1 signaling selectively engages AKT-2/DAF-16 to promote DNA damage-induced germ cell apoptosis downstream of CEP-1 through the Ras pathway.
10598120	Vasopeptidase inhibition with omapatrilat improves cardiac geometry and survival in cardiomyopathic hamsters more than does ACE inhibition with captopril.	Vasopeptidase inhibitors are single molecules that inhibit neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) simultaneously. Omapatrilat, the first in this new class of cardiovascular agents, potentiates vasodilatory and cardioprotective peptides and represses angiotensin II. This study compared the effects of omapatrilat with those of a pure ACE inhibitor on cardiac geometry and survival in animals with heart failure. BIO TO-2 cardiomyopathic hamsters (CMHs) in the early stages of dilated heart failure were treated with vehicle or maximal ACE inhibitory doses of captopril (750 micromol/kg/day) or omapatrilat (200 micromol/kg/day). Prolonged vasopeptidase inhibition increased median survival time after the start of treatment by 99 and 31% compared with vehicle and captopril, respectively (median survival times: 146, 221, and 290 days with vehicle, captopril, and omapatrilat, respectively; p < 0.001 for all comparisons). In similar CMHs, captopril or omapatrilat administered for 2 months significantly (p < 0.05) decreased heart weight, pulmonary congestion (lung weight), and left ventricular (LV) chamber volume compared with vehicle. Omapatrilat significantly increased LV mass-to-volume ratio compared with vehicle and captopril. Omapatrilat, but not captopril, significantly increased urinary atrial natriuretic peptide excretion, indicating NEP inhibition. Thus vasopeptidase inhibition with omapatrilat was more effective than ACE inhibition with captopril in preventing changes in LV geometry and premature mortality in hamsters with dilated heart failure.
23220742	The selective SYK inhibitor P505-15 (PRT062607) inhibits B cell signaling and function in vitro and in vivo and augments the activity of fludarabine in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.	B-cell receptor (BCR) associated kinases including spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) contribute to the pathogenesis of B-cell malignancies. SYK is persistently phosphorylated in a subset of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and SYK inhibition results in abrogation of downstream kinase activity and apoptosis. P505-15 (also known as PRT062607) is a novel, highly selective, and orally bioavailable small molecule SYK inhibitor (SYK IC(50) = 1 nM) with anti-SYK activity that is at least 80-fold greater than its affinity for other kinases. We evaluated the preclinical characteristics of P505-15 in models of NHL and CLL. P505-15 successfully inhibited SYK-mediated B-cell receptor signaling and decreased cell viability in NHL and CLL. Oral dosing in mice prevented BCR-mediated splenomegaly and significantly inhibited NHL tumor growth in a xenograft model. In addition, combination treatment of primary CLL cells with P505-15 plus fludarabine produced synergistic enhancement of activity at nanomolar concentrations. Our findings support the ongoing development of P505-15 as a therapeutic agent for B-cell malignancies. A dose finding study in healthy volunteers has been completed.
15705795	Endothelial apoptosis induced by inhibition of integrins alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 involves ceramide metabolic pathways.	Matrix ligation of integrins alphavbeta3/alphavbeta5 is critical for endothelial survival and angiogenesis. We have previously shown that ceramide, a proapoptotic lipid second messenger, increases during endothelial anoikis (detachment-induced apoptosis). We now show that RGDfV, an integrin alphavbeta3/alphavbeta5 cyclic function-blocking peptide, increased ceramide and decreased sphingomyelin in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) plated on vitronectin, suggesting that sphingomyelin hydrolysis contributes to RGDfV-induced ceramide increase. Desipramine and imipramine, inhibitors of acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase), suppressed RGDfV-induced ceramide increase. Importantly, desipramine, imipramine, and a third ASMase inhibitor, SR33557, but not inhibitors of neutral sphingomyelinase, suppressed RGDfV-induced apoptosis, suggesting that ASMase was required for integrin-mediated apoptosis. Myriocin, an inhibitor of de novo ceramide synthesis, had no effect on RGDfV-induced HBMEC apoptosis. Interestingly, ASMase inhibitors also suppressed the RGDfV-induced loss of spreading on vitronectin. RGDfV induced a similar increase in ceramide and apoptosis in HBMECs on poly-l-lysine or vitronectin, although cells detached only from vitronectin, indicating that cell detachment was not required for RGDfV-induced apoptosis. Our results suggest involvement of ASMase and ceramide in endothelial apoptosis induced by inhibition of integrins alphavbeta3/alphavbeta5, and propose a novel molecular mechanism for the antiangiogenic effect of RGDfV.
21058326	Effects of the histamine H1 antagonist chlorcyclizine on rat fetal palate development.	BACKGROUND: The effects of histamine H1 antagonist chlorcyclizine on rat palate development were characterized following in utero exposure. METHODS: To identify the optimum dose for inducing cleft palate, pregnant rats were administered 30, 60, or 90 mg/kg chlorcyclizine on Gestation Days 11 to 14. Fetal palate gene expression was also assessed after 90 mg/kg chlorcyclizine at 8, 15 and 30 hours post-dose on Gestation Day 14 using microarray and qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Rats in the 60- and 90-mg/kg groups exhibited adverse clinical signs and body weight loss. Rats in the 90-mg/kg group also demonstrated increases in late resorptions and decreases in fetal weight. Effects in the low-dose group were limited to decreases in body weight gain. Fetal assessment on Gestation Day 21 revealed that findings were limited to the 60- and 90-mg/kg groups, and included cleft palate (80% of litters for both groups), high arched palate, small nose, micrognathia, high domed head, digits shortened/absent and small limb. The fetal incidence of cleft palate was higher at 90 mg/kg, thus this dose was selected to assess palate gene expression. The altered genes associated with chlorcyclizine-induced cleft palate included Wnt5a, Bmp2, Bmp4, Fgf10, Fgfr2, Msx1, and Insig1 but the magnitude of the change was relatively small (1.5- to 2-fold). CONCLUSIONS: Expression of several genes involved in palate, limb and digit development was altered in the fetal palate following in utero exposure to chlorcyclizine. The subtle perturbation and interplay of these genes may have profound effects on the dynamics of fetal palate development.
10685879	Selective inhibition of monoamine neurotransmitter transporters by synthetic local anesthetics.	Synthetic local anesthetics (LAs) have been found to have cocaine-like characteristics with some psychotomimetic action, possibly through monoaminergic neurotransmission. To gain insight into the relation between LA action and monoamine transporters, we investigated the effect of synthetic LAs on neurotransmitter transporters, including monoamine transporters. We used cloned transporter cDNAs and examined transient functional expression in COS cells and stable expression in HeLa cells. Among the LAs tested, procaine and other ester-type LAs inhibited [3H]DA uptake and binding of [3H]2-beta-carbomethoxy-3-beta-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane (CFT), a cocaine analogue, in COS cells expressing rat dopamine transporter (DAT). The inhibition was concentration-dependent. The inhibitory effect on [3H]DA uptake was reversible and not dependent on pH, as observed in HeLa cells stably expressing DAT. Procaine also inhibited uptake of norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT) by the norepinephrine transporter (NET) or serotonin transporter (SERT) expressed in COS cells. On the other hand, procaine and other LAs had little or no effect on [3H]GABA and [3H]glutamate uptake in COS cells expressing mouse GABA or rat glutamate/aspartate transporter. IC50 values for [3H]DA uptake inhibition correlated well with those for [3H]CFT binding inhibition, but not with intrinsic anesthetic potency. Kinetic analysis of monoamine uptake inhibition by procaine in COS cells expressing rat DAT, NET or SERT revealed a competitive action similar to that of cocaine. These results demonstrate that certain LAs selectively inhibit monoamine transporters. This might contribute to the cocaine-like psychotomimetic action of certain LAs.
23402371	A membrane vesicle-based assay to enable prediction of human biliary excretion.	Abstract 1. Prediction of biliary excretion is a challenge due to the lack of in vitro assays. Our laboratory previously demonstrated a highly significant correlation between in vitro IC(50) values against mrp2 using rat canalicular liver plasma membrane vesicles and in vivo biliary excretion (Colombo et al., 2012). This study explores the possibility of predicting in vivo biliary excretion in human using membrane vesicles prepared from MDCKII cells transfected with human ABCC2. 2. In vitro MRP2 activity was determined by measuring the ATP-dependent uptake of 5(6)-carboxy-2',7'-dichlorofluorescein (CDCF) in inside-out membrane vesicles isolated from MDCK-ABCC2 cells. CDCF uptake was time- and concentration-dependent (K(m) of 4.0 ± 1.2 µM and a V(max) of 7.8 ± 0.9 pmol/mg/min) and inhibited by benzbromarone and MK-571 with IC(50) values of 1.2 and 7.6 µM, respectively. 3. A significant linear correlation (r(2 )= 0.790) between the in vitro IC(50) values from the described MRP2 assay and in vivo biliary excretion in humans was observed using 11 well-documented drugs covering low to high biliary excretions. 4. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that inhibition of CDCF uptake in MDCKII-ABCC2 vesicles not only provides a screening assay to assess MRP2 drug-drug interaction potential, but is also predictive of human MRP2-mediated biliary excretion.
14766200	Expression of DDAH1 in chick and rat embryos.	Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1 (DDAH1) is an enzyme that metabolizes methylated arginine to citrulline and methylamine, thus working to produce nitric oxide (NO). We isolated a gene encoding chick DDAH1. In situ hybridization analysis revealed characteristic DDAH1 mRNA expression in the embryonic spinal cord, which was especially strong in the ventral horn and dorsal root ganglion (DRG). DDAH1 was also detected in the brain, kidney, digestive tract, and in other tissues. We examined the expression pattern of DDAH1 in developing rats and compared this with the expression pattern in chicks. The expression pattern in the rats was very similar to that in the chicks, but there were some differences between the chicks and rats in the amount of DDAH1 detected in the heart, liver, lung, and DRG. We also investigated neural nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) mRNA expression patterns in rat embryos. The DDAH1 expression patterns were completely different from nNOS expression patterns. Our study suggests that DDAH1 plays an important role in development.
17916059	The use of escitalopram beyond major depression: pharmacological aspects, efficacy and tolerability in anxiety disorders.	Escitalopram, the active (S)-enantiomer of citalopram, has been approved in many countries throughout the world for the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders. It is more potent and selective than citalopram in inhibiting serotonin re-uptake in the CNS, and less potent than various other selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors in relation to other transporter proteins and receptors: in particular, it is six times less potent than citalopram in binding to the histamine H1 and muscarinic receptors. Escitalopram has favourable pharmacokinetics: it is rapidly absorbed, has a bioavailability of 80% and is not affected by food intake. It has little potential for drug interactions: it has low protein binding and, as it is metabolised by three CYP isozymes, any impairment in the activity of one is unlikely to have a significant effect on metabolic clearance. Caution is necessary only when it is coadministered with drugs metabolised by CYP2D6, such as metoprolol, or administered to the elderly or patients with severe hepatic or renal impairment. The multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of oral escitalopram are proportional at a range of doses including its therapeutic doses. Escitalopram is approved for the treatment of a number of anxiety disorders. It seems to be well tolerated and induces few or no discontinuation symptoms, and may be considered a first-line agent for the pharmacotherapy of obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder and social phobia. Further studies are needed to define its activity in impulse control disorders.
23583931	The ATP required for potentiation of skeletal muscle contraction is released via pannexin hemichannels.	During repetitive stimulation of skeletal muscle, extracellular ATP levels raise, activating purinergic receptors, increasing Ca(2+) influx, and enhancing contractile force, a response called potentiation. We found that ATP appears to be released through pannexin1 hemichannels (Panx1 HCs). Immunocytochemical analyses and function were consistent with pannexin1 localization to T-tubules intercalated with dihydropyridine and ryanodine receptors in slow (soleus) and fast (extensor digitorum longus, EDL) muscles. Isolated myofibers took up ethidium (Etd(+)) and released small molecules (as ATP) during electrical stimulation. Consistent with two glucose uptake pathways, induced uptake of 2-NBDG, a fluorescent glucose derivative, was decreased by inhibition of HCs or glucose transporter (GLUT4), and blocked by dual blockade. Adult skeletal muscles apparently do not express connexins, making it unlikely that connexin hemichannels contribute to the uptake and release of small molecules. ATP release, Etd(+) uptake, and potentiation induced by repetitive electrical stimulation were blocked by HC blockers and did not occur in muscles of pannexin1 knockout mice. MRS2179, a P2Y1R blocker, prevented potentiation in EDL, but not soleus muscles, suggesting that in fast muscles ATP activates P2Y1 but not P2X receptors. Phosphorylation on Ser and Thr residues of pannexin1 was increased during potentiation, possibly mediating HC opening. Opening of Panx1 HCs during repetitive activation allows efflux of ATP, influx of glucose and possibly Ca(2+) too, which are required for potentiation of contraction. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Connexin based channels'.
12582227	DRF 2655: a unique molecule that reduces body weight and ameliorates metabolic abnormalities.	OBJECTIVE: Preclinical evaluation of DRF 2655, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) and PPARgamma agonist, as a body-weight lowering, hypolipidemic and euglycemic agent. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: DRF 2655 was studied in different genetic, normal, and hyperlipidemic animal models. HEK 293 cells were used to conduct the reporter-based transactivation of PPARalpha and PPARgamma. To understand the biochemical mechanism of lipid-, body-weight-, and glucose-lowering effects, activities of key beta-oxidation and lipid catabolism enzymes and gluconeogenic enzymes were studied in db/db mice treated with DRF 2655. 3T3L1 cells were used for adipogenesis study, and HepG2 cells were used to study the effect of DRF 2655 on total cholesterol and triglyceride synthesis using [(14)C]acetate and [(3)H]glycerol. RESULTS: DRF 2655 showed concentration-dependent transactivation of PPARalpha and PPARgamma. In the 3T3L1 cell-differentiation study, DRF 2655 and rosiglitazone showed 369% and 471% increases, respectively, in triglyceride accumulation. DRF 2655 showed body-weight lowering and euglycemic and hypolipidemic effects in various animal models. db/db mice treated with DRF 2655 showed 5- and 3.6-fold inhibition in phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose 6-phosphatase activity and 651% and 77% increases in the beta-oxidation enzymes carnitine palmitoyltransferase and carnitine acetyltransferase, respectively. HepG2 cells treated with DRF 2655 showed significant reduction in lipid synthesis. DISCUSSION: DRF 2655 showed excellent euglycemic and hypolipidemic activities in different animal models. An exciting finding is its body-weight lowering effect in these models, which might be mediated by the induction of target enzymes involved in hepatic lipid catabolism through PPARalpha activation.
23329465	Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: current issues and novel treatment approaches.	Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is considered the most common liver disorder in the Western world. It is commonly associated with insulin resistance, obesity, dyslipidaemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is characterized by steatosis with necroinflammation and eventual fibrosis, which can lead to end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. Its pathogenesis is complex, and involves a state of 'lipotoxicity' in which insulin resistance, with increased free fatty acid release from adipose tissue to the liver, play a key role in the onset of a 'lipotoxic liver disease' and its progression to NASH. The diagnosis of NASH is challenging, as most affected patients are symptom free and the role of routine screening is not clearly established. A complete medical history is important to rule out other causes of fatty liver disease (alcohol abuse, medications, other). Plasma aminotransferase levels and liver ultrasound are helpful in the diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH, but a liver biopsy is often required for a definitive diagnosis. However, there is an active search for plasma biomarkers and imaging techniques that may non-invasively aid in the diagnosis. The treatment of NASH requires a multifaceted approach. The goal is to reverse obesity-associated lipotoxicity and insulin resistance via lifestyle intervention. Although there is no pharmacological agent approved for the treatment of NAFLD, vitamin E (in patients without T2DM) and the thiazolidinedione pioglitazone (in patients with and without T2DM) have shown the most consistent results in randomized controlled trials. This review concentrates on our current understanding of the disease, with a focus on the existing therapeutic approaches and potential future pharmacological developments for NAFLD and NASH.
1407010	"5-HT1R"" or 5-HT1D sites? Evidence for 5-HT1D binding sites in rabbit brain.	Radioligand binding studies were performed in membranes of rabbit whole brain and striatum using the novel iodinated radioligand for 5-hydroxytryptamine 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D sites, Serotonin-5-O-Carboxymethyl-Glycyl[125I]Tyrosinamide ([125I]GTI). [125I]GTI labelled a finite number of high affinity sites in rabbit brain membranes, Bmax = 191 +/- 47 fmol/mg protein, pKD (-log mol/l) = 8.50 +/- 0.13, n = 5. The pharmacological profile of [125I]GTI binding was fully comparable to that reported previously in human and other brain preparations known to possess 5-HT1D sites (using either [3H]5-HT or [125I]GTI) and displayed a characteristic rank order of affinity: 5-carboxamido-tryptamine greater than 5-HT = dihydroergotamine greater than or equal to ergotamine greater than or equal to sumatriptan greater than or equal to CGS 12066 greater than or equal to metergoline greater than yohimbine greater than or equal to methysergide greater than ICYP greater than 8-OH-DPAT greater than or equal to CP 93129 greater than (-)pindolol greater than ketanserin greater than isamoltane greater than mesulergine greater than corynanthine greater than buspirone greater than MDL 72222. Autoradiographic studies were performed on rabbit brain slices using [3H]5-HT in the presence of 100 nmol/l 8-OH-DPAT and mesulergine (in order to mask 5-HT1A and 5-HT1C binding sites) and [125I]CYP (iodocyanopindolol) in the presence of 3 mumol/l isoprenaline and 100 nmol/l 8-OH-DPAT (in order to mask beta adrenoceptor and 5-HT1A binding sites). There was no detectable specific binding of [125I]CYP through the brain, thus excluding the presence of 5-HT1B sites in rabbit brain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
15931605	Use of nitisinone in patients with alkaptonuria.	Alkaptonuria, a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the HGD gene and deficiency of homogentisate 1,2 dioxygenase, is characterized by ochronosis, arthritis, and daily excretion of gram quantities of homogentisic acid (HGA). Nitisinone, an inhibitor of the enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, can drastically reduce urinary excretion of HGA in individuals with alkaptonuria. We investigated the safety and the HGA-depleting efficacy of nitisinone in an open-label, single-center study of 9 alkaptonuria patients (5 women, 4 men; 35-69 years of age) over the course of 3 to 4 months. Each patient received nitisinone in incremental doses, 0.35 mg bid followed by 1.05 mg bid, and remained on this dosage and a regular diet for 3 months. Nitisinone reduced urinary HGA levels from an average of 4.0 +/- 1.8 (SD) g/day to 0.2 +/- 0.2 g/day ( P < .001). The average plasma tyrosine concentration, initially 68 +/- 18 mmicro mol/L, rose to 760 +/- 181 micro mol/L ( P < .001). During the final week of the study, 5 patients adhered to a protein-restricted diet (40 g/day), and their mean plasma tyrosine level fell from 755 +/- 167 to 603 +/- 114 mu mol/L. Six of the 7 patients who received nitisinone for more than 1 week reported decreased pain in their affected joints. Weekly ophthalmologic examinations showed no signs of corneal toxicity. Adverse events included the passing of kidney stones, the recognition of symptoms related to aortic stenosis, and elevation of liver transaminase levels. We conclude that low-dose nitisinone effectively reduced urinary HGA levels in patients with alkaptonuria. Future long-term clinical trials are planned to determine the benefits of nitisinone in preventing joint deterioration and providing pain relief, and its long-term side effects.
11455568	Effects of 1alpha,25-(OH)(2)D(3) on rat growth zone chondrocytes are mediated via cyclooxygenase-1 and phospholipase A(2).	1alpha,25-(OH)(2)D(3) mediates its effects on growth zone chondrocytes via rapid membrane-associated events as well as through traditional nuclear receptor mechanisms. The membrane-associated signaling pathways include rapid production of diacylglycerol and activation of protein kinase C (PKC), as well as activation of phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)), increased production of arachidonic acid, and increased production of prostaglandins. This study examined the roles of PLA(2) and cyclooxygenase (Cox) in the mechanism of action of 1alpha,25-(OH)(2)D(3) in these cells to determine whether one or both enzymes catalyze the rate limiting step and whether constitutive or inducible Cox is involved. Cultures were incubated with 1alpha,25-(OH)(2)D(3) for 9 min to measure PKC or for 24 h to measure physiological responses ([(3)H]-thymidine incorporation, alkaline phosphatase specific activity, [(35)S]-sulfate incorporation). Based on RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis, growth zone chondrocytes expressed mRNAs for both Cox-1 and Cox-2 and neither Cox was modulated by 1alpha,25-(OH)(2)D(3). To examine the role of Cox, the cultures were also treated with resveratrol (a specific inhibitor of Cox-1), NS-398 (a specific inhibitor of Cox-2), or indomethacin (a general Cox inhibitor). The results showed that Cox-1 inhibition reduced the 1alpha,25-(OH)(2)D(3)-dependent effects on proliferation, differentiation, and matrix production, whereas inhibition of Cox-2 only had an effect on proliferation. The effects of Cox inhibition were not rate limiting, based on experiments in which PLA(2) was activated with melittin or inhibited with quinacrine. However, at least part of the action of 1alpha,25-(OH)(2)D(3) was regulated by metabolism of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. This supports the hypothesis that 1alpha,25-(OH)(2)D(3) exerts its effects via more than one signaling pathway and that these pathways are interrelated via the modulation of PLA(2) as a rate-limiting step. PKC regulation may occur at multiple stages in the signal transduction cascade. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 36: 32-45, 2001.
3089818	Intestinal permeability and lactose hydrolysis in human rotaviral gastroenteritis assessed simultaneously by non-invasive differential sugar permeation.	Changes in intestinal permeability and lactose hydrolysis have been investigated in three adults and fifteen infants with acute rotaviral gastroenteritis by differential sugar absorption. The method involves chromatographic measurement of urinary lactose, lactulose and L-rhamnose excretion following combined ingestion in an iso-osmolar test solution. All patients had abnormal intestinal permeability indicated by raised urine lactulose/L-rhamnose excretion, ratio of percentages recovered in 5 h, of 0.462 (0.100-1.227) mean and range, compared with 0.027 (0.008-0.052) for healthy controls (P less than 0.001). Ten patients also had urinary lactose/lactulose excretion ratios raised above the normal range (0.014-0.41, mean 0.258) during their acute illness, indicating impaired intestinal lactose hydrolysis. Both indices had become normal 4 weeks after the acute illness, serial investigation of five patients showing that improvement was complete much earlier. Except for the short duration these changes are similar to those associated with villous atrophy in coeliac disease. The test procedure was verified with respect to intestinal lactose hydrolysis by demonstrating a linear relationship between lactose/lactulose excretion and log jejunal mucosal lactase activity by in vitro assay (R2 = 0.95) in a further group of subjects. Differential lactose/lactulose/L-rhamnose absorption provides a non-invasive and sensitive index of small intestinal integrity of value for the interpretation of prolonged or otherwise complicated enteritis and the distinction of primary secondary intestinal lactase deficiency.
12183670	Bupropion inhibits nicotine-evoked [(3)H]overflow from rat striatal slices preloaded with [(3)H]dopamine and from rat hippocampal slices preloaded with [(3)H]norepinephrine.	Bupropion, an efficacious antidepressant and smoking cessation agent, inhibits dopamine and norepinephrine transporters (DAT and NET, respectively). Recently, bupropion has been reported to noncompetitively inhibit alpha3beta2, alpha3beta4, and alpha4beta2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) expressed in Xenopus oocytes or established cell lines. The present study evaluated bupropion-induced inhibition of native alpha3beta2* and alpha3beta4* nAChRs using functional neurotransmitter release assays, nicotine-evoked [(3)H]overflow from superfused rat striatal slices preloaded with [(3)H]dopamine ([(3)H]DA), and nicotine-evoked [(3)H]overflow from hippocampal slices preloaded with [(3)H]norepinephrine ([(3)H]NE). The mechanism of inhibition was evaluated using Schild analysis. To eliminate the interaction of bupropion with DAT or NET, nomifensine or desipramine, respectively, was included in the superfusion buffer. A high bupropion concentration (100 microM) elicited intrinsic activity in the [(3)H]DA release assay. However, none of the concentrations (1 nM-100 microM) examined evoked [(3)H]NE overflow and, thus, were without intrinsic activity in this assay. Moreover, bupropion inhibited both nicotine-evoked [(3)H]DA overflow (IC(50) = 1.27 microM) and nicotine-evoked [(3)H]NE overflow (IC(50) = 323 nM) at bupropion concentrations well below those eliciting intrinsic activity. Results from Schild analyses suggest that bupropion competitively inhibits nicotine-evoked [(3)H]DA overflow, whereas evidence for receptor reserve was obtained upon assessment of bupropion inhibition of nicotine-evoked [(3)H]NE overflow. Thus, bupropion acts as an antagonist at alpha3beta2* and alpha3beta4* nAChRs in rat striatum and hippocampus, respectively, across the same concentration range that inhibits DAT and NET function. The combination of nAChR and transporter inhibition produced by bupropion may contribute to its clinical efficacy as a smoking cessation agent.
2087492	Barrel rotation in rats induced by SMS 201-995: suppression by ceruletide.	Intracerebroventricular administration of SMS 201-995 (5 micrograms/rat), a somatostatin analogue, induced barrel rotation in rats. Pretreatment with ceruletide (40 micrograms/100 g b. wt., IP) 3 days or 7 days prior to the injection of SMS 201-995 significantly inhibited the response rate of barrel rotation induced by SMS 201-995, but not that induced by arginine-vasopressin (1 microgram/rat, ICV). The suppressive effect of ceruletide on barrel rotation could be partially countered by MK-329, a selective peripheral CCK (CCK-A) receptor antagonist. Desulfated cerulein did not affect the barrel rotation induced by SMS 201-995. These findings suggest that ceruletide specifically suppresses the barrel rotation evoked by SMS 201-995 in a long-lasting manner possibly acting through CCK-A receptor.
15001403	A comparison of phenytoin-loading techniques in the emergency department.	OBJECTIVES: To compare the effectivenesses of three phenytoin-loading techniques. METHODS: Patients with subtherapeutic phenytoin concentrations who presented within 48 hours of a seizure were randomized to receive either 20 mg/kg of oral phenytoin (PO), divided in maximum doses of 400 mg every two hours, 18 mg/kg of intravenous phenytoin (IVP) at an initial infusion rate of 50 mg/min, or 18 mg/kg (phenytoin equivalents) of intravenous fosphenytoin (IVF) at an initial infusion rate of 150 mg/min. RESULTS: A total of 45 patients were enrolled: 16 in the PO group, 14 in the IVP group, and 15 in the IVF group. The times required to reach therapeutic drug concentrations were (mean +/- standard deviation [SD]) 5.62 +/- 0.28 hours, 0.24 +/- 0.3 hours, and 0.21 +/- 0.28 hours, respectively. A total of 17, 27, and 32 adverse drug events were observed in the PO, IVP, and IVF groups, respectively, with significantly fewer events in the PO group (p = 0.02, p = 0.01). No significant difference was found between the numbers of necessary adjustments to the infusions in the two IV groups. The average time to safe emergency department discharge was significantly shorter for the IV groups compared with the PO group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Oral loading has fewer adverse drug events than either IV loading method, but its use may be limited when therapeutic concentrations are required quickly. Although IVF loading is faster, from an adverse-drug event perspective, no advantage of IVF over IVP was apparent.
10420171	Discovery of novel peptidic dopamine transporter ligands by screening a positional scanning combinatorial hexapeptide library.	The acute reinforcing effects of cocaine are thought by some to result from cocaine binding to the dopamine (DA) transporter, which inhibits DA uptake and increases synaptic DA levels in the mesolimbic system. Other data suggest that neurotransmitters other than DA contribute to cocaine reinforcement and addiction. These considerations illustrate the need to have additional research tools with which to test the ""DA hypothesis."" One strategy is to identify drugs which bind to the DA transporter (DAT ligands) but which do not inhibit DA uptake as effectively as cocaine. The purpose of the present study was to identify members of a novel structural class of DAT ligands and to characterize their interactions at the DA transporter. A positional scanning hexapeptide D-amino acid library was screened for inhibition of [(125)I]RTI-55 binding to rat caudate DA transporters. Based on the results, 12 peptides were synthesized. All 12 peptides inhibited [(125)I]RTI-55 binding to DA transporters with IC(50) values, which ranged from 1.8 microM to 12 microM. The two most potent peptides (TPI-669-1 and TPI-669-4) were prepared in larger quantities and were characterized further for activity at the DAT and 5-HT transporter. Both peptides inhibited DA and 5-HT uptake and transporter binding with IC(50)/K(i) values in the low micromolar range. In vivo microdialysis studies demonstrated that both peptides increase extracellular DA and 5-HT in the nucleus accumbens of rats. These data demonstrate that peptides can function as inhibitors of biogenic amine transport. Future work will focus on developing more potent and selective peptides. Published 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
1329582	Effects of nedocromil sodium and WEB 2086 on chemoattractant-stimulated neutrophil migration through cellular and noncellular barriers.	Nedocromil sodium (Tilade) is an effective therapeutic agent against asthma and has been shown to exhibit antiinflammatory activity in vitro; however, its mode of action is yet to be described fully. Using an in vitro assay designed to mimic the extravasation of neutrophils from the peripheral circulation through cellular barriers to sites of inflammation, the effect of nedocromil sodium on chemoattractant-stimulated neutrophil migration was examined. We also examined the effects of WEB 2086, a platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor antagonist, in parallel. Neutrophils and the cellular barrier were pretreated and/or co-incubated with nedocromil or WEB 2086 and the effects on neutrophil chemotaxis measured. In all treatments, nedocromil did not significantly affect chemotaxis through cellular or noncellular barriers to N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP), leukotriene B4 (LTB4), or PAF. In contrast, WEB 2086 inhibited PAF-induced neutrophil migration through both naked filters and endothelial and epithelial monolayers cultured on these filters. We conclude that while nedocromil has been shown to have inhibitory effects on neutrophils and is an effective therapeutic agent for asthma and inflammatory conditions, its activity is not primarily mediated by inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis. Platelet-activating factor antagonists may partially be effective in asthma through inhibitory effects on neutrophil chemotaxis.
23065141	The toxicity of the N-hydroxy and 6-hydroxy metabolites of 3,4-dichloropropionanilide does not depend on calcium release-activated calcium channel inhibition.	Each year ~1 billion kg of herbicides are used worldwide to control the unwanted growth of plants. In the United States, over a quarter of a billion kg of herbicides are used, representing 28% of worldwide use. (Kiely, T., Donaldson, D., and Grube, A. [2004]. Pesticide Industry Sales and Usage. 2000 and 2001 Market Estimates. Available at: http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/pestsales/01pestsales/market_estimates2001.pdf. Accessed October 25, 2012.) Propanil (3,4-dichloropropionanilide [DCPA]) is a commonly used herbicide in the United States, with 2-4 million kg applied annually to 2 million acres of crop land. The immunomodulatory effects of DCPA have been well documented, but limited data are available on the effects of its metabolites. (Salazar, K. D., Ustyugova, I. V., Brundage, K. M., Barnett, J. B., and Schafer, R. [2008]. A review of the immunotoxicity of the pesticide 3,4-dichloropropionanalide. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health B Crit. Rev. 11, 630-645.) In mammals, hepatic enzymes metabolize DCPA, resulting in the production of 3,4-dichloroaniline (DCA). Further biotransformation of DCA leads to the production of 6-hydroxy-3,4-dichloroaniline (6OH-DCA) and N-hydroxy-3,4-dichloroaniline (NOH-DCA). We report, for the first time, the immunotoxic effects of DCPA metabolites on T-cell function. Human Jurkat T cells were exposed to varying concentrations of DCPA or its metabolites and assayed for effects on T-cell function. In addition, fluorine analogs of DCPA and DCA were investigated to determine the relative role of chlorine substituents on T-cell immunotoxicity. Here we report that exposure of Jurkat T cells to DCPA and DCA alters IL-2 secretion, nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) activity, and calcium influx. However, exposure to 6OH-DCA and NOH-DCA reduces IL-2 secretion and NFAT activity but has no effect on calcium flux. When both chlorines in DCPA and DCA were substituted with fluorines all effects were abrogated. Our data indicate that metabolites of DCPA have differential effects on T-cell function and the presence of chlorines plays an important role in eliciting these effects.
10908292	Modulation of KCNQ2/3 potassium channels by the novel anticonvulsant retigabine.	Retigabine is a novel anticonvulsant with an unknown mechanism of action. It has recently been reported that retigabine modulates a potassium channel current in nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells (), however, to date the molecular correlate of this current has not been identified. In the present study we have examined the effects of retigabine on recombinant human KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 potassium channels, expressed either alone or in combination in Xenopus oocytes. Application of 10 microM retigabine to oocytes expressing the KCNQ2/3 heteromeric channel shifted both the activation threshold and voltage for half-activation by approximately 20 mV in the hyperpolarizing direction, leading to an increase in current amplitude at test potentials between -80 mV and +20 mV. Retigabine also had a marked effect on KCNQ current kinetics, increasing the rate of channel activation but slowing deactivation at a given test potential. Similar effects of retigabine were observed in oocytes expressing KCNQ2 alone, suggesting that KCNQ2 may be the molecular target of retigabine. Membrane potential recordings in oocytes expressing the KCNQ2/3 heteromeric channel showed that application of retigabine leads to a concentration-dependent hyperpolarization of the oocyte, from a resting potential of -63 mV under control conditions to -85 mV in the presence of 100 microM retigabine (IC(50) = 5.2 microM). In control experiments retigabine had no effect on either resting membrane potential or endogenous oocyte membrane currents. In conclusion, we have shown that retigabine acts as a KCNQ potassium channel opener. Because the heteromeric KCNQ2/3 channel has recently been reported to underlie the M-current, it is likely that M-current modulation can explain the anticonvulsant actions of retigabine in animal models of epilepsy.
23478260	Age-Related Macular Degeneration-Associated Silent Polymorphisms in HtrA1 Impair Its Ability To Antagonize Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1.	Synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within a transcript's coding region produce no change in the amino acid sequence of the protein product and are therefore intuitively assumed to have a neutral effect on protein function. We report that two common variants of high-temperature requirement A1 (HTRA1) that increase the inherited risk of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (NvAMD) harbor synonymous SNPs within exon 1 of HTRA1 that convert common codons for Ala34 and Gly36 to less frequently used codons. The frequent-to-rare codon conversion reduced the mRNA translation rate and appeared to compromise HtrA1's conformation and function. The protein product generated from the SNP-containing cDNA displayed enhanced susceptibility to proteolysis and a reduced affinity for an anti-HtrA1 antibody. The NvAMD-associated synonymous polymorphisms lie within HtrA1's putative insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) binding domain. They reduced HtrA1's abilities to associate with IGF-1 and to ameliorate IGF-1-stimulated signaling events and cellular responses. These observations highlight the relevance of synonymous codon usage to protein function and implicate homeostatic protein quality control mechanisms that may go awry in NvAMD.
23479389	[6]-gingerol: a novel AT₁ antagonist for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.	Considering the prevalence of cardiovascular disease in public health and the limited validated therapeutic options, this study aimed to find novel compounds targeting the angiotensin II type 1 receptor, accepted as a therapeutic target in cardiovascular disease. A small library consisting of 89 compounds from 39 Chinese herbs was profiled using a cell-based calcium mobilization assay which was developed and characterized for high-throughput screening. [6]-Gingerol derived from Zingiber officinale Roscoe (ginger) was identified as a novel angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist, with an IC50 value of 8.173 µM. The hit was further tested by a specificity assay indicating that it had no antagonistic effects on other evaluated GPCRs, such as endothelin receptors. The major ingredient of ginger, [6]-gingerol, could inhibit angiotensin II type 1 receptor activation, which partially clarified the mechanism of ginger regulating blood pressure and strengthening heart in the cardiovascular system.
22812659	Androgen insensitivity syndrome.	Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is a disorder caused by a mutation of the gene encoding the androgen receptor (AR; Xq11-q12). The prevalence of AIS has been estimated to be one case in every 20,000 to 64,000 newborn males for the complete syndrome (CAIS), and the prevalence is unknown for the partial syndrome (PAIS). The symptoms range from phenotypically normal males with impaired spermatogenesis to phenotypically normal women with primary amenorrhea. Various forms of ambiguous genitalia have been observed at birth. The diagnosis is confirmed by determining the exact mutation in the AR gene. PAIS individuals require precise diagnosis as early as possible so that the sex can be assigned, treatment can be recommended, and they can receive proper genetic counseling. After birth, differential diagnosis should be performed using other forms of abnormal sexual differentiation of primary amenorrhea. The treatment of AIS is based on reinforcement sexual identity, gonadectomy planning, and hormone replacement therapy. The prognosis for CAIS is good if the testicular tissue is removed at the appropriate time. For PAIS, the prognosis depends on the ambiguity of the genitalia and physical and psychosocial adjustment to the assigned sex.
23028137	Portal vein glucose entry triggers a coordinated cellular response that potentiates hepatic glucose uptake and storage in normal but not high-fat/high-fructose-fed dogs.	The cellular events mediating the pleiotropic actions of portal vein glucose (PoG) delivery on hepatic glucose disposition have not been clearly defined. Likewise, the molecular defects associated with postprandial hyperglycemia and impaired hepatic glucose uptake (HGU) following consumption of a high-fat, high-fructose diet (HFFD) are unknown. Our goal was to identify hepatocellular changes elicited by hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, and PoG signaling in normal chow-fed (CTR) and HFFD-fed dogs. In CTR dogs, we demonstrated that PoG infusion in the presence of hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia triggered an increase in the activity of hepatic glucokinase (GK) and glycogen synthase (GS), which occurred in association with further augmentation in HGU and glycogen synthesis (GSYN) in vivo. In contrast, 4 weeks of HFFD feeding markedly reduced GK protein content and impaired the activation of GS in association with diminished HGU and GSYN in vivo. Furthermore, the enzymatic changes associated with PoG sensing in chow-fed animals were abolished in HFFD-fed animals, consistent with loss of the stimulatory effects of PoG delivery. These data reveal new insight into the molecular physiology of the portal glucose signaling mechanism under normal conditions and to the pathophysiology of aberrant postprandial hepatic glucose disposition evident under a diet-induced glucose-intolerant condition.
23574807	Synthesis, Antidepressant Evaluation and Docking Studies of Long-Chain Alkylnitroquipazines as Serotonin Transporter Inhibitors.	Twelve alkyl analogues (1-12) of the high-affinity serotonin transporter (SERT) inhibitor 6-nitroquipazine (6-NQ) were synthesized and studied using in vitro radioligand competition binding assays to determine their binding affinity (Ki ). The putative antidepressant activity of five of the binders with the highest SERT binding affinities was studied by the forced swim and locomotor activity mouse tests. The three-dimensional (3D) structures of 8 and 9 were determined using NOE NMR technique. Flexible docking of the compounds was undertaken to illustrate the binding of the compounds in the SERT model. Our results showed that several of the 6-NQ analogues are high-affinity SERT inhibitors and indicated that the octyl (8), decyl (10) and dodecyl (12) 6-NQ analogues exhibit moderate antidepressant activity.
23348407	Dietary relevant mixtures of phytoestrogens inhibit adipocyte differentiation in vitro.	Phytoestrogens (PEs) are naturally occurring plant components, with the ability to induce biological responses in vertebrates by mimicking or modulating the action of endogenous hormones. Single isoflavones have been shown to affect adipocyte differentiation, but knowledge on the effect of dietary relevant mixtures of PEs, including for instance lignans, is lacking. In the current study dietary relevant mixtures of isoflavones and their metabolites, lignans and their metabolites, coumestrol, and a mixture containing all of them, were examined for effects on adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, as well as tested for their PPARγ activating abilities. The results showed that mixtures of isoflavonoid parent compounds and metabolites, respectively, a mixture of lignan metabolites, as well as coumestrol concentration-dependently inhibited adipocyte differentiation. Furthermore, a mixture of isoflavonoid parent compounds, and a mixture of isoflavonoid metabolites were found to have PPARγ activating abilities. These results suggest that PEs can affect pathways known to play a role in obesity development, and indicate that the inhibitory effect on adipocyte differentiation does not appear to be strictly associated with PPARγ activation/inhibition. The current study support the hypothesis that compounds with endocrine activity can affect pathways playing a role in the development obesity and obesity related diseases.
23330542	PXR antagonists and implication in drug metabolism.	Adopted orphan nuclear receptor (NR), pregnane X receptor (PXR), plays a central role in the regulation of xeno- and endobiotic metabolism. Since the discovery of the functional role of PXR in 1998, there is evolving evidence for the role of PXR agonists in abrogating metabolic pathophysiology (e.g., cholestasis, hypercholesterolemia, and inflammation). However, more recently, it is clear that PXR is also an important mediator of adverse xeno- (e.g., enhances acetaminophen toxicity) and endobiotic (e.g., hepatic steatosis) metabolic phenotypes. Moreover, in cancer therapeutics, PXR activation can induce drug resistance, and there is growing evidence for tissue-specific enhancement of the malignant phenotype. Thus, in these instances, there may be a role for PXR antagonists. However, as opposed to the discovery efforts for PXR agonists, there are only a few antagonists described. The mode of action of these antagonists (e.g., sulforaphane) remains less clear. Our laboratory efforts have focused on this question. Since the original discovery of azoles analogs as PXR antagonists, we have preliminarily defined an important PXR antagonist pharmacophore and developed less-toxic PXR antagonists. In this review, we describe our published and unpublished findings on recent structure-function studies involving the azole chemical scaffold. Further work in the future is needed to fully define potent, more-selective PXR antagonists that may be useful in clinical application.
19503773	Tolcapone: review of its pharmacology and use as adjunctive therapy in patients with Parkinson's disease.	Levodopa has been the gold standard therapy for the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease for more than three decades. Although it remains the most effective treatment, its long-term use is associated with motor fluctuations and dyskinesias that can be disabling for patients and difficult for physicians to manage medically. In the last 10 years, the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor tolcapone has been studied for its efficacy as an adjunctive treatment to levodopa plus a dopa decarboxylase inhibitor. Adjunctive therapy with tolcapone can significantly reduce the dose of levodopa required. Moreover, treatment with tolcapone significantly reduces wearing off and on-off periods in fluctuating patients and improves 'on' time in patients with stable disease. Tolcapone has assumed a new place in the arsenal of medications for Parkinson's disease. This paper reviews the pharmacology, safety and efficacy of tolcapone in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. After some initial concerns about its safety, tolcapone has been shown to be safe if used and monitored according to guidelines regarding liver function. Tolcapone produces expected dopaminergic side effects, including headache, nausea, insomnia, as well as diarrhea; however, these side effects are generally mild and as a rule do not result in discontinuation of therapy.
18423812	Triple pharmacological blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in nondiabetic CKD: an open-label crossover randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Agents inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) system have an important role in slowing the progression of chronic kidney disease. We evaluated the hypothesis that the addition of an aldosterone receptor antagonist to an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and angiotensin II type 1 (AT-1) receptor blocker (ARB) (triple RAAS blockade) may provide an additional benefit compared with an ACE inhibitor and ARB (double RAAS blockade). DESIGN: Randomized open controlled crossover study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 18 whites (7 women, 11 men) from the Outpatient Department of Nephrology with chronic nondiabetic proteinuric kidney diseases, mean age 42.4 +/- 1.9 years (SEM). INTERVENTIONS: In the 8-week run-in period, all participants received the ACE inhibitor cilazapril (5 mg), the ARB telmisartan (80 mg), and the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg) as double RAAS blockade to achieve the target blood pressure of less than 130/80 mm Hg. Participants were then randomly assigned to 2 treatment sequences, either the addition of spironolactone (25 mg) (triple RAAS blockade) through 8 weeks followed by double RAAS blockade through 8 weeks (sequence 1) or double RAAS blockade followed by triple RAAS blockade (sequence 2). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 24-hour urine protein excretion (primary end point) and markers of tubular injury and fibrosis (secondary end points). Analysis was performed using analysis of variance for repeated measurements. RESULTS: At baseline, mean serum creatinine level was 1.16 +/- 0.09 mg/dL (103 +/- 8 micromol/L), estimated glomerular filtration rate was 107.8 mL/min (95% confidence interval, 93 to 140.9 [1.8 mL/s; 95% confidence interval, 1.55 to 2.35; Cockcroft-Gault formula), and 24-hour mean proteinuria was 0.97 +/- 0.18 g. Mean urine protein excretion was 0.7 g/24 h (95% confidence interval, 0.48 to 0.92) less after triple RAAS blockade than after double RAAS blockade (P = 0.01), without change in blood pressure. Urine excretion of N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (P = 0.02) and amino-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen (P = 0.05) also significantly decreased. Potassium levels increased significantly after triple therapy (P = 0.02). However, no patient was withdrawn because of adverse effects. LIMITATIONS: Absence of blinding, small sample size, short treatment period, absence of histological assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of an aldosterone receptor antagonist in addition to double RAAS blockade with an ACE inhibitor and ARB may slow the progression of chronic kidney disease. Additional studies are necessary to confirm this result.
15336276	Probing for a hydrophobic a binding register in prostate-specific membrane antigen with phenylalkylphosphonamidates.	To explore for the existence of an auxiliary hydrophobic binding register remote from the active site of PSMA a series of phenylalkylphosphonamidate derivatives of glutamic acid were synthesized and evaluated for their inhibitory potencies against PSMA. Both the phenyl- and benzylphosphonamidates (1a and 1b) exhibited only modest inhibitory potency against. The phenethyl analog 1c was intermediate in inhibitory potency while inhibitors possessing a longer alkyl tether from the phenyl ring, resulted in markedly improved K(i) values. The greatest inhibitory potency was obtained for the inhibitors in which the phenyl ring was extended furthest from the central phosphorus (1f, n=5 and 1g, n=6). The slightly serrated pattern that emerged as the alkyl tether increased from three to six methylene units suggests that inhibitory potency is not simply correlated to increased hydrophobicity imparted by the phenylalkyl chain, but rather that one or more hydrophobic binding registers may exist remote from the substrate recognition architecture in the active site of PSMA.
17869551	Endothelial nitric oxide production is tightly coupled to the citrulline-NO cycle.	Nitric oxide (NO) is an important vasorelaxant produced along with L-citrulline from L-arginine in a reaction catalyzed by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Previous studies suggested that the recycling of L-citrulline to L-arginine is essential for NO production in endothelial cells. However, there is no direct evidence demonstrating the degree to which the recycling of L-citrulline to L-arginine is coupled to NO production. We hypothesized that the amount of NO formed would be significantly higher than the amount of L-citrulline formed due to the efficiency of L-citrulline recycling via the citrulline-NO cycle. To test this hypothesis, endothelial cells were incubated with [14C]-L-arginine and stimulated by various agents to produce NO. The extent of NO and [14C]-L-citrulline formation were simultaneously determined. NO production exceeded apparent L-citrulline formation of the order of 8 to 1, under both basal and stimulated conditions. As further support, alpha-methyl-DL-aspartate, an inhibitor of argininosuccinate synthase (AS), a component of the citrulline-NO cycle, inhibited NO production in a dose-dependent manner. The results of this study provide evidence for the essential and efficient coupling of L-citrulline recycling, via the citrulline-NO cycle, to endothelial NO production.
3098406	Prevention of dacarbazine damage of human neoplastic cell DNA by aphidicolin.	Treatment of human neoplastic cells with dacarbazine both inhibits DNA synthesis and induces damage in the DNA. Lysis of cells in dilute alkali and subsequent electrophoretic analysis of the isolated DNA show that the DNA of treated cells includes a high molecular weight component and a population of 2-10-kilobase single-stranded DNA fragments while untreated cells contain only high molecular weight DNA. When DNA is pulse-labeled at the beginning of the dacarbazine treatment high amounts of small DNA fragments are seen but no labeled high molecular weight DNA. Moreover the DNA fragments are not formed in cells which are treated with aphidicolin before the addition of dacarbazine. Aphidicolin is a specific inhibitor of DNA polymerase alpha, the enzyme responsible for the replicative synthesis of DNA. We conclude that dacarbazine damages DNA only in cells which are synthesizing new DNA.
23230133	The bovine ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCG2 Tyr581Ser single-nucleotide polymorphism increases milk secretion of the fluoroquinolone danofloxacin.	The bovine adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter G2 (ABCG2/breast cancer resistance protein) polymorphism Tyr581Ser (Y581S) has recently been shown to increase in vitro transepithelial transport of antibiotics. Since this transporter has been extensively related to the active secretion of drugs into milk, the potential in vivo effect of this polymorphism on secretion of xenobiotics in livestock could have striking consequences for milk production, the dairy industry, and public health. Our purpose was to study the in vivo effect of this polymorphism on the secretion of danofloxacin, a widely used veterinary antibiotic, into milk. Danofloxacin (1.25 mg/kg) was administered to six Y/Y 581 homozygous and six Y/S 581 heterozygous lactating cows, and plasma and milk samples were collected and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. No differences were found in the pharmacokinetic parameters of danofloxacin in plasma between the two groups of animals. In contrast, Y/S heterozygous cows showed a 2-fold increase in danofloxacin levels in milk. In addition, the pharmacokinetic elimination parameters, mean residence time and elimination half-life, were significantly lower in the milk of the animals carrying the Y/S polymorphism. These in vivo results are in agreement with our previously published in vitro data, which showed a greater capacity of the S581 variant in accumulation assays, and demonstrate, for the first time, an important effect of the Y581S single-nucleotide polymorphism on antibiotic secretion into cow milk. These findings could be extended to other ABCG2 substrates, and may be relevant for the treatment of mastitis and for the design of accurate and novel strategies to handle milk residues.
23224291	Proteomic and metabolomic responses to connexin43 silencing in primary hepatocyte cultures.	Freshly established cultures of primary hepatocytes progressively adopt a foetal-like phenotype and display increased production of connexin43. The latter is a multifaceted cellular entity with variable subcellular locations, including the mitochondrial compartment. Cx43 forms hemichannels and gap junctions that are involved in a plethora of physiological and pathological processes, such as apoptosis. The present study was conducted with the goal of shedding more light onto the role of connexin43 in primary hepatocyte cultures. Connexin43 expression was suppressed by means of RNA interference technology, and the overall outcome of this treatment on the hepatocellular proteome and metabolome was investigated using tandem mass tag-based differential protein profiling and (1)H NMR spectroscopy, respectively. Global protein profiling revealed a number of targets of the connexin43 knock-down procedure, including mitochondrial proteins (heat shock protein 60, glucose-regulated protein 75, thiosulphate sulphurtransferase and adenosine triphosphate synthase) and detoxifying enzymes (glutathione S-transferase μ 2 and cytochrome P450 2C70). At the metabolomic level, connexin43 silencing caused no overt changes, though there was some evidence for a subtle increase in intracellular glycine quantities. Collectively, these data could further substantiate the established existence of a mitochondrial connexin pool and could be reconciled with the previously reported involvement of connexin43 signalling in spontaneously occurring apoptosis in primary hepatocyte cultures.
15942128	Butorphanol: effects of a prototypical agonist-antagonist analgesic on kappa-opioid receptors.	The opioid analgesic, butorphanol (17-cyclobutylmethyl-3,14-dihydroxymorphinan) tartrate is a prototypical agonist-antagonist opioid analgesic agent whose potential for abuse has been the cause of litigation in the United States. With a published affinity for opioid receptors in vitro of 1:4:25 (mu:delta:kappa), the relative contribution of actions at each of these receptors to the in vivo actions of the drug are an issue of active investigation. A body of evidence has been developed which indicates that a substantial selective action of butorphanol on the kappa-opioid receptor mediates the development of tolerance to butorphanol and cross-tolerance to other opioid agonists; to the production of dependence upon butorphanol, particularly in the rodent; and to compensatory alterations in brain opioid receptor-effector systems. This perspective will identify the current state of understanding of the effects produced by butorphanol on brain opioid receptors, particularly on the kappa-opioid receptor subtype, and on the expression of phosphotyrosyl proteins following chronic treatment with butorphanol.
20800906	Low dose combination steroids control autoimmune mouse hearing loss.	The severe side effects of glucocorticoids prevent long term management of hearing loss. Alternative steroid treatments that minimize or eliminate these effects would significantly benefit therapeutic control of hearing disorders. A steroid treatment study of autoimmune mouse hearing loss was conducted to determine the efficacy of combining aldosterone and prednisolone at low doses. An assessment also was made of low dose fludrocortisone, a synthetic mineralocorticoid that also has a slight glucocorticoid effect. MRL/MpJ-Fas(lpr) mice were tested for baseline ABR thresholds at 3 months of age and then treated with aldosterone (3.0 mug/kg) or prednisolone (1.0 mg/kg) to determine the lowest effective dose of each. Other mice were given the two steroids in combination at doses of Pred 0.5 mg+Aldo 1.5 mug; Pred 1.0 mg+Aldo 3.0 mug; or Pred 1.5 mg+Aldo 5.0 mug. Mice were retested with ABR at 1 and 2 months to determine the efficacy of the different steroid treatments in controlling hearing loss. Another series of mice were given the synthetic mineralocorticoid fludrocortisone at low (2.8 mug/kg) or high (10 mug/kg) doses and retested at monthly intervals for 3 months. Autoimmune mouse hearing loss developed in untreated controls. This threshold elevation was not prevented by prednisolone at 1 mg/kg or by aldosterone at 3 mug/kg when each was given alone. However, the two steroids combined at these doses effectively controlled hearing loss. The fludrocortisone treatments also were effective at low doses in preventing or reversing the autoimmune mouse hearing loss. This efficacy of combined steroids at low doses suggests the potential for reducing the side effects of glucocorticoids in the therapeutic control of hearing disorders.
10340919	Comparison of inhibitory effects of meloxicam and diclofenac on human thromboxane biosynthesis after single doses and at steady state.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the extent of human cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) inhibition by meloxicam, which has been reported to preferentially inhibit cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). The effects of meloxicam were compared with those of diclofenac, a nonselective COX inhibitor. METHODS: COX-1 inhibition was determined by measuring thromboxane B2 (TXB2)-generation from clotting whole blood ex vivo after single oral doses of 7.5 and 15 mg meloxicam and 75 mg diclofenac and at steady state (15 mg meloxicam daily and 150 mg diclofenac daily). The effect was expressed as percentage inhibition of serum TXB2 generation and was directly related to the serum drug concentration with use of a standard sigmoidal E(max) model. RESULTS: In terms of inhibition of TXB2 generation, diclofenac was about 1 order of magnitude more potent than meloxicam, indicated by a diclofenac EC50 (concentration of drug required to cause 50% of maximum effect) that was about 10 times lower than that of meloxicam (EC50 diclofenac single doses: 37.50+/-29.64; EC50 meloxicam single doses: 677.50+/-189.08). However, serum concentrations of meloxicam after administration of 15 mg were approximately 10-fold higher than those of diclofenac. Therefore there was no statistically significant difference in the area under the effect time curve (P = .115) and the mean effect (P = .424) between meloxicam and diclofenac. The EC50 of both drugs was significantly higher at steady state (diclofenac steady state: 87.07+/-55.24 ng/mL; meloxicam steady state: 1850.12+/-829.93 ng/mL) than after a single dose (P < .001). CONCLUSION: These data show that meloxicam inhibits TXB2 generation at clinically relevant doses, although less potently than diclofenac. Thus our data suggest that the COX-2 preference of meloxicam observed in vitro may not result in clinical advantages when the higher dose of 15 mg is needed. Because of the increase in EC50 at steady state, COX-1 is relatively spared when the lower dose of 7.5 mg is administered.
23554049	Furanodiene Presents Synergistic Anti-proliferative Activity With Paclitaxel Via Altering Cell Cycle and Integrin Signaling in 95-D Lung Cancer Cells.	Furanodiene (FUR) is a natural terpenoid isolated from Rhizoma Curcumae, a well-known Chinese medicinal herb that presents anti-proliferative activities in several cancer cell lines. Recently, we found that the combined treatment of FUR with paclitaxel (TAX) showed synergetic anti-proliferative activities in 95-D lung cancer cells. Herein, we showed that FUR reduced the cell numbers distributed in mitosis phase induced by TAX while increased those in G1 phase. The protein levels of cyclin D1, cyclin B1, CDK6 and c-Myc were all down-regulated in the group of combined treatment. The dramatically down-regulated expression of integrin β4, focal adhesion kinase and paxillin might partially contribute to the synergic effect. Though FUR alone obviously induced endoplasmic reticulum stress, this signaling pathway may not contribute to the synergetic anti-proliferative effect as the protein expression of CHOP and BIP was similar in FUR alone and combined treatment group.

1929324	Physiological effects of fenpropimorph on wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae and fenpropimorph-resistant mutants.	Fenpropimorph-resistant mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were isolated by a gradient selection procedure. The mutants were cross-resistant to other morpholines (fenpropidin, dodemorph, tridemorph) and 15-azasterol, but were susceptible to azoles (miconazole, clotrimazole, ketoconazole) and nystatin. In the absence of fenpropimorph, the major sterol produced by the mutants and the parental strain was ergosterol. In the presence of fenpropimorph, ignosterol (ergosta-8,14-dien-3 beta-ol) was the major sterol produced by the mutants and the parental strain. The resistance to fenpropimorph involves two recessive genes, each of which allows a semiresistance, when they are isolated apart from one another. Strain JR4 (erg3 erg11), which produces 14-methylfecosterol [14 alpha-methyl-ergosta-8,24(28)-dien- 3-beta-ol) as the major sterol in the presence or absence of fenpropimorph, was also found to be resistant to the drug. The growth inhibitory effect of fenpropimorph on wild-type cells appears to be linked to the production of ignosterol. The uptake of exogenous sterol by wild-type cells was greatly enhanced in the presence of fenpropimorph. The growth inhibition caused by fenpropimorph could only be overcome with bulk levels of exogenous C-5,6-unsaturated sterols.
20083608	A fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based M2 muscarinic receptor sensor reveals rapid kinetics of allosteric modulation.	Allosteric modulators have been identified for several G protein-coupled receptors, most notably muscarinic receptors. To study their mechanism of action, we made use of a recently developed technique to generate fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based sensors to monitor G protein-coupled receptor activation. Cyan fluorescent protein was fused to the C terminus of the M(2) muscarinic receptor, and a specific binding sequence for the small fluorescent compound fluorescein arsenical hairpin binder, FlAsH, was inserted into the third intracellular loop; the latter site was labeled in intact cells by incubation with FlAsH. We then measured FRET between the donor cyan fluorescent protein and the acceptor FlAsH in intact cells and monitored its changes in real time. Agonists such as acetylcholine and carbachol induced rapid changes in FRET, indicative of agonist-induced conformational changes. Removal of the agonists or addition of an antagonist caused a reversal of this signal with rate constants between 400 and 1100 ms. The allosteric ligands gallamine and dimethyl-W84 caused no changes in FRET when given alone, but increased FRET when given in the presence of an agonist, compatible with an inactivation of the receptors. The kinetics of these effects were very rapid, with rate constants of 80-100 ms and approximately 200 ms for saturating concentrations of gallamine and dimethyl-W84, respectively. Because these speeds are significantly faster than the responses to antagonists, these data indicate that gallamine and dimethyl-W84 are allosteric ligands and actively induce a conformation of the M(2) receptor with a reduced affinity for its agonists.
23535363	Interferon-γ Promoter Is Hypermethylated in Blood DNA from Workers with Confirmed Diisocyanate Asthma.	Risk factors have not been identified that determine susceptibility for development of diisocyanate-induced occupational asthma (DA). We hypothesized that diisocyanate (DI) exposure could modify gene promoter regions regulating transcription of cytokine mediators and thereby influence expression of DA. A cross-sectional study was designed to investigate the promoter methylation status of candidate genes in DI-exposed workers. Subjects consisted of 131 workers in three groups: 40 cases with DA confirmed by a positive specific inhalation challenge (SIC) (DA+), 41 exposed workers with lower respiratory symptoms and negative SIC (DA-), and 50 asymptomatic exposed workers (AWs). We studied four candidate genes (GSTM1, DUSP22, IFN-γ, and IL-4) for which altered promoter methylation has been previously investigated for relationships with a variety of other environmental exposures. Methylation status was determined using methylation-specific quantitative PCR performed on genomic DNA extracted from whole blood. Results showed that relative methylation of IFN-γ promoter was significantly increased in DA+ in comparison with both comparator groups (DA- and AW), and it exhibited good sensitivity (77.5%) and specificity (80%) for identifying DA workers in a multivariate predictive model after adjusting for type of DI exposure, smoking status, methacholine PC20, and gender. IL-4 promoter was slightly less methylated only in DA+ compared with AW among nonsmoking workers. Both GSTM1 and DUSP22 promoter methylations were found not associated with DA. Our finding suggests that exposure to occupational chemicals could play a heretofore undefined mechanistic role via epigenetic modification of specific genes in the promoter region.
23401165	Arsenic geochemistry in a biostimulated aquifer: An aqueous speciation study.	Stimulating microbial growth through the use of acetate injection wells at the former uranium mill site in Rifle, Colorado, USA, has been shown to decrease dissolved uranium (VI) concentrations through bacterial reduction to immobile uranium (IV). Bioreduction also changed the redox chemistry of site groundwater, altering the mobility of several other redox-sensitive elements present in the subsurface, including iron, sulfur, and arsenic. Following acetate amendment at the site, elevated concentrations of arsenic in the groundwater were observed. Ion chromatography-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry was used to determine the aqueous arsenic speciation. Upgradient samples, unexposed to acetate, showed low levels of arsenic (≈1 μM), with greater than 90% as arsenate (As[V]) and a small amount of arsenite (As[III]). Downgradient acetate-stimulated water samples had much higher levels of arsenic (up to 8 μM), and 4 additional thioarsenic species were present under sulfate-reducing conditions. These thioarsenic species demonstrate a strong correlation between arsenic release and sulfide concentrations in groundwater, and their formation may explain the elevated total arsenic concentrations. An alternative remediation approach, enhanced flushing of uranium, was accomplished by addition of bicarbonate and did not result in highly elevated arsenic concentrations.

23144001	Real-time fluorescence turn-on detection of alkaline phosphatase activity with a novel perylene probe.	A tetracationic perylene probe (probe 1) was designed and synthesized. Probe 1 was used for the real-time fluorescence turn-on assay of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and inhibitor screening. Probe 1 monomer fluorescence could be very efficiently quenched by ATP through the formation of an ATP/probe 1 complex. ALP triggered the degradation of ATP, the breakdown of the ATP/probe 1 complex, and the recovery of the probe 1 monomer fluorescence. In the presence of an ALP inhibitor, a decrease in fluorescence recovery was observed.
10698696	Antizyme inhibitor is rapidly induced in growth-stimulated mouse fibroblasts and releases ornithine decarboxylase from antizyme suppression.	Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) catalyses the first step in the synthesis of the polyamines putrescine, spermidine and spermine. The polyamines are essential for cell growth, but at elevated levels they may be tumorigenic, toxic, or may induce apoptosis. Therefore, ODC activity is highly regulated. It is induced when cells are stimulated to grow, and it is subjected to feedback inhibition by the polyamines. By causing ribosomal frameshifting, polyamines induce the synthesis of antizyme, a 23-kDa protein, which binds to ODC, inhibits its activity and promotes its degradation by the 26 S proteasome. Antizyme, in turn, is inhibited by antizyme inhibitor (AZI). We describe the cloning of a mouse AZI cDNA, encoding a protein with high homology to mouse ODC. Using purified recombinant proteins, we show that AZI (which has no ODC activity) can release enzymically active ODC from antizyme suppression in vitro. We also show that ODC reactivation takes place in mouse fibroblasts upon transient transfection with an AZI-expressing plasmid construct. Finally we demonstrate that the AZI mRNA content of mouse fibroblasts increases significantly within an hour of growth stimulation, i.e. much earlier than ODC transcripts. Our results indicate that induction of AZI synthesis may represent a means of rescuing ODC molecules that have been inactivated and tagged for degradation by antizyme, when culture conditions improve and polyamine production is needed for cell growth and proliferation.
19951374	Role of muscarinic receptor activation in regulating immune cell activity in nasal mucosa.	BACKGROUND: The prevalence of airway inflammatory disorders keeps rising; its pathogenic mechanism is still not fully understood. OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to investigate the role of muscarinic receptor (M receptor) in regulating the immune cell activity in nasal mucosa by using surgical removed nasal mucosa from patients with nasal polyposis (NP) as a study platform. METHODS: Human nasal mucosal sample was collected from inferior turbinectomy of 86 patients with NP or/and allergic rhinitis. Expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), M receptor, OX40 ligand was measured in nasal mucosa by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, flow cytometry, and Western blotting assay. RESULTS: When compared with non-NP (nNP) nasal mucosa, contents of TNF-alpha and TNF-alpha+ cells markedly increased in NP nasal mucosa; immune staining colocalized M3 receptor+ and TNF-alpha+ cells in NP nasal mucosa; exposure of isolated CD4+ T cells to methacholine induced the release of TNF-alpha. We also found CD11c+/M3 receptor+ cells in NP nasal mucosa. Methacholine increased the expression of OX40L in dendritic cells. Staphylococcal (S) aureus and S. enterotoxin B (SEB) were detected in NP nasal mucosa. Exposure of dendritic cells or naive CD4+ T cells to SEB initiated the expression of M3 receptor at mRNA and protein levels. CONCLUSIONS: The present data demonstrate that parasympathetic activity has the capacity to activate dendritic cells to release OX40 ligand, the latter induces CD4+ T cells to produce IL-4 and TNF-alpha that may further contribute to the pathogenesis of NP.
17363544	A nonfucosylated anti-HER2 antibody augments antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in breast cancer patients.	PURPOSE: Removal of fucose residues from the oligosaccharides of human antibody is a powerful approach to enhance antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), a potential important antitumor mechanism of therapeutic antibodies. To provide clinically relevant evidence of this mechanism, we investigated ADCC of a fucose-negative version of trastuzumab [anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) humanized antibody] using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from breast cancer patients as effector cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Thirty volunteers, including 20 breast cancer patients and 10 normal healthy control donors, were recruited randomly, and aliquots of peripheral blood were collected. ADCC of commercial trastuzumab (fucosylated) and its fucose-negative version were measured using PBMCs drawn from the volunteers as effector cells and two breast cancer cell lines with different HER2 expression levels as target cells. Relationships between cytotoxicity and characteristics of the patients, such as content of natural killer cells in PBMCs, type of therapy, FCGR3A genotypes, etc. were also analyzed. RESULTS: ADCC was significantly enhanced with the fucose-negative antibody compared with the fucose-positive antibody using PBMCs from either normal donors or breast cancer patients. Enhancement of ADCC was observed irrespective of the various clinical backgrounds of the patients, even in the chemotherapy cohort that presented with a reduced number of natural killer cells and weaker ADCC. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study suggests that the use of fucose-negative antibodies may improve the therapeutic effects of anti-HER2 therapy for patients independent of clinical backgrounds.
11056242	Effect of hormonal agents on monocyte chemotactic protein-1 expression by endometrial epithelial cells of women with endometriosis.	OBJECTIVE: To assess whether hormonal agents used in the medical treatment of endometriosis, such as danazol and GnRH agonist, exert direct regulatory action on monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) expression by endometrial epithelial cells. DESIGN: Primary cultures of epithelial cells isolated from human endometrium were exposed to different concentrations of cytokines and steroid hormone analogs. Expression of MCP-1 was analyzed at the levels of protein and messenger RNA. SETTING: Gynecology clinic and laboratory of endocrinology of reproduction. PATIENT(S): Women presenting for infertility or pelvic pain in whom endometriosis was diagnosed by using laparoscopy. INTERVENTION(S): Endometrial tissue biopsy performed at laparoscopy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Secretion of MCP-1 protein was measured by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and mRNA steady-state levels were measured by performing Northern blot analysis. RESULT(S): Buserelin acetate, a GnRH agonist (0.1-10 ng/mL), had no significant effect on MCP-1 expression, whereas danazol (10(-7)-10(-5) M), a testosterone analog, and dexamethasone, an anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid hormone (10(-12)-10(-6)M), showed a direct and a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on MCP-1 expression. This effect occurred at the level of protein and mRNA. CONCLUSION(S): The findings of the study may affect understanding of the mechanisms by which hormonal treatments act on endometriosis and influence its clinical manifestations.
25225185	Acute effects of brexpiprazole on serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine systems: an in vivo electrophysiologic characterization.	Brexpiprazole, a compound sharing structural molecular characteristics with aripiprazole, is currently under investigation for the treatment of schizophrenia and depression. Using electrophysiologic techniques, the present study assessed the in vivo action of brexpiprazole on serotonin (5-HT) receptor subtypes 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, and 5-HT2A; dopamine (DA) D2 autoreceptors, and alpha1- and alpha2-adrenergic receptors. In addition, the effects on 5-HT1A autoreceptors in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and D2 autoreceptors in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) were compared with those of aripiprazole, an agent in wide clinical use. In the DRN, brexpiprazole completely inhibited the firing of 5-HT neurons via 5-HT1A agonism and was more potent than aripiprazole (ED50 = 230 and 700 mug/kg, respectively). In the locus coeruleus, brexpiprazole reversed the inhibitory effect of the preferential 5-HT2A receptor agonist DOI (2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine) on norepinephrine neuronal firing (ED50 = 110 mug/kg), demonstrating 5-HT2A antagonistic action. Brexpiprazole reversed the inhibitory effect of the DA agonist apomorphine on VTA DA neurons (ED50 = 61 mug/kg), whereas it was ineffective when administered alone, indicating partial agonistic action on D2 receptors. Compared with aripiprazole, which significantly inhibited the firing activity of VTA DA neurons, brexpiprazole displayed less efficacy at D2 receptors. In the hippocampus, brexpiprazole acted as a full agonist at 5-HT1A receptors on pyramidal neurons. Furthermore, it increased 5-HT release by terminal alpha2-adrenergic heteroceptor but not 5-HT1B autoreceptor antagonism. In the lateral geniculate nucleus, brexpiprazole displayed alpha1B-adrenoceptor antagonistic action. Taken together, these results provide insight into the in vivo action of brexpiprazole on monoamine targets relevant in the treatment of depression and schizophrenia.
23230273	The yeast cap binding complex modulates transcription factor recruitment and establishes proper histone H3K36 trimethylation during active transcription.	Recent studies have revealed a close relationship between transcription, histone modification, and RNA processing. In fact, genome-wide analyses that correlate histone marks with RNA processing signals raise the possibility that specific RNA processing factors may modulate transcription and help to ""write"" chromatin marks. Here we show that the nuclear cap binding complex (CBC) directs recruitment of transcription elongation factors and establishes proper histone marks during active transcription. A directed genetic screen revealed that deletion of either subunit of the CBC confers a synthetic growth defect when combined with deletion of genes encoding either Ctk2 or Bur2, a component of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ortholog of P-TEFb. The CBC physically associates with these complexes to recruit them during transcription and mediates phosphorylation at Ser-2 of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II. To understand how these interactions influence downstream events, histone H3K36me3 was examined, and we demonstrate that CBCΔ affects proper Set2-dependent H3K36me3. Consistent with this, the CBC and Set2 have similar effects on the ability to rapidly induce and sustain activated gene expression, and these effects are distinct from other histone methyltransferases. This work provides evidence for an emerging model that RNA processing factors can modulate the recruitment of transcription factors and influence histone modification during elongation.
23611809	Human UGT2B10 in Drug N-glucuronidations: Substrate Screening and Comparison with UGT1A3 and UGT1A4.	Recent observations revealed that human UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2B10 catalyzes N-glucuronidation of amine-containing compounds. Knowledge of the substrate specificity and clinical significance of UGT2B10 is still limited. The purpose of this study was to expand the knowledge of UGT2B10 substrates and to evaluate its significance in drug clearance. Using recombinant UGT2B10, we found that it catalyzes the N-glucuronidation of amitriptyline, imipramine, ketotifen, pizotifen, olanzapine"	
23568773	Signaling mechanism of tumor cell-induced up-regulation of E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR2.	The N-end rule pathway contributes significantly to accelerated muscle proteolysis mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in various catabolic conditions. UBR2 (aka E3α-II) is the only known E3 ubiquitin ligase of the N-end rule pathway that is up-regulated by cachectic stimuli including proinflammatory cytokines and tumors. However, the signaling mechanism through which UBR2 is up-regulated remains undetermined. Here we identify a signaling pathway that mediates tumor cell-induced up-regulation of UBR2. UBR2 expression in C2C12 myotubes was up-regulated by conditioned medium from Lewis lung carcinoma cells or C26 colon adenocarcinoma cells, which was blocked by a pharmacological inhibitor of p38α/β mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), SB202190. Similarly, SB202190 administration (i.p.) abolished UBR2 up-regulation in the tibialis anterior of LLC tumor-bearing mice. Genetic gain and loss of function assays in C2C12 myotubes indicated that tumor-induced activation of the p38β isoform is sufficient and necessary for UBR2 up-regulation. In addition, UBR2 up-regulation required p38β-mediated phosphorylation of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)-β Thr-188, which was critical to C/EBPβ binding to the UBR2 promoter. Furthermore, luciferase reporter assay revealed that the C/EBPβ binding motif in the UBR2 promoter is a functional C/EBPβ-responsive cis-element that enhances the promoter activity on activation by p38β. Finally, genetic ablation of C/EBPβ blocked UBR2 up-regulation in LLC tumor-bearing mice.

23194156	Growth and differentiation of prechondrogenic cells on bioactive self-assembled peptide nanofibers.	Restoration of cartilage defect remains a challenge, as the current treatments are ineffective to return tissue to its health. Thus, developing therapies for treatment of cartilage tissue damage caused by common joint diseases including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and accidents is crucial. Sulfated glycosaminoglycan molecules are vital constituents of both developing and mature cartilage extracellular matrix. The interplay between regulator proteins and glycosaminoglycan molecules has an essential role in coordinating differentiation, expansion, and patterning during cartilage development. In this study, we exploited the functional role of an extracellular matrix on chondrogenic differentiation by imitating extracellular matrix both chemically by imparting functional groups of native glycosaminoglycans and structurally through peptide nanofiber network. For this purpose, sulfonate, carboxylate, and hydroxyl groups were incorporated on self-assembled peptide nanofibers. We observed that when ATDC5 cells were cultured on functional peptide nanofibers, they rapidly aggregated in insulin-free medium and formed cartilage-like nodules and deposited sulfated glycosaminoglycans shown by Safranin-O staining. Moreover, collagen II and aggrecan gene expressions revealed by qRT-PCR were significantly enhanced, which indicated the remarkable bioactive role of this nanofiber system on chondrogenic differentiation. Overall, these results show that glycosaminoglycan mimetic peptide nanofiber system provides a promising platform for cartilage regeneration.
16319075	Calcium-permeable acid-sensing ion channel is a molecular target of the neurotoxic metal ion lead.	Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are emerging as fundamental players in the regulation of neural plasticity and in pathological conditions. Here we showed that lead (Pb2+), a well known neurotoxic metal ion, reversibly and concentration-dependently inhibited ASIC currents in the acutely dissociated spinal dorsal horn and hippocampal CA1 neurons of rats. In vitro expression of ASIC subunits in combination demonstrated that both ASIC1 and -3 subunits were sensitive to Pb2+. Mechanistically, Pb2+ reduced the pH sensitivity of ASICs independent of membrane voltage change. Moreover, Pb2+ inhibited the ASIC-mediated membrane depolarization and the elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration. In addition, we compared the effect of Pb2+ with that of Ca2+ or amiloride to explore the possible interactions of Pb2+ and Ca2+ in regulating ASICs, and we found that Pb2+ inhibited ASIC currents independent of the amiloride/Ca2+ blockade. Because ASIC1b and -3 subunits are mainly expressed in peripheral neurons, our data identified ASIC1a-containing Ca2+-permeable ASIC as a novel central target of Pb2+ action, which may contribute to Pb2+ neurotoxicity.
23022069	Performance of urinary and gene expression biomarkers in detecting the nephrotoxic effects of melamine and cyanuric acid following diverse scenarios of co-exposure.	Although standard nephrotoxicity assessments primarily detect impaired renal function, KIM-1, clusterin, NGAL, osteopontin and TIMP-1 were recently identified biomarkers proposed to indicate earlier perturbations in renal integrity. The recent adulteration of infant and pet food with melamine (MEL) and structurally-related compounds revealed that co-ingestion of MEL and cyanuric acid (CYA) could form melamine-cyanurate crystals which obstruct renal tubules and induce acute renal failure. This study concurrently evaluated the ability of multiplexed urinary biomarker immunoassays and biomarker gene expression analysis to detect nephrotoxicity in F344 rats co-administered 60ppm each of MEL and CYA in feed or via gavage for 28days. The biomarkers were also evaluated for the ability to differentiate the effects of the compounds when co-administered using diverse dosing schedules (i.e., consecutive vs. staggered gavage) and dosing matrixes (i.e., feed vs. gavage). Our results illustrate the ability of both methods to detect and differentiate the severity of adverse effects in the staggered and consecutive gavage groups at much lower doses than previously observed in animals co-exposed to the compounds in feed. We also demonstrate that these urinary biomarkers outperform traditional diagnostic methods and represent a powerful, non-invasive indicator of chemical-induced nephrotoxicity prior to the onset of renal dysfunction.
23223414	Effect of nuclear vibrations, temperature, co-adsorbed water, and dye orientation on light absorption, charge injection and recombination conditions in organic dyes on TiO2.	We study the effect of nuclear motions at different temperatures, including the effect of a dye molecule's orientation with respect to the oxide surface, on factors determining the performance of dye sensitized solar cells: light absorption, electron injection, and back-donation. We perform ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of aminophenyl acid dyes NK1 and NK7, differing by the electron donating group, in a vacuum and adsorbed in mono- and bi-dentate modes on a dry and a water-covered anatase (101) surface of TiO(2), at 300 and 350 K. Nuclear vibrations and an increase of temperature cause a red shift in the absorption spectra of free dyes. This effect is preserved in dyes on dry TiO(2) but largely disappears in the presence of water. Averaged over nuclear vibrations, the driving force to injection, ΔG, differs from the static estimate. It depends on the adsorption mode and the presence of H(2)O but is almost the same for 300 and 350 K. Recombination to the dye cation is expected to be much enhanced by the approach of the dye oxidation equivalent hole to the surface during dye wagging around TiO(2). This effect is somewhat mitigated by the co-adsorbed water. The dynamics of ΔG(t) are explained by uncorrelated evolution of the energies of the dye excited state and the conduction band minimum of the oxide due to their respective vibrations, and are almost independent of dye orientation. It may therefore be possible to independently control the conditions of recombination and of injection.
23341183	"A ""clickable"" MTX reagent as a practical tool for profiling small-molecule-intracellular target interactions via MASPIT."	We present a scalable synthesis of a versatile MTX reagent with an azide ligation handle that allows rapid γ-selective conjugation to yield MTX fusion compounds (MFCs) appropriate for MASPIT, a three-hybrid system that enables the identification of mammalian cytosolic proteins that interact with a small molecule of interest. We selected three structurally diverse pharmacologically active compounds (tamoxifen, reversine, and FK506) as model baits. After acetylene functionalization of these baits, MFCs were synthesized via a CuAAC reaction, demonstrating the general applicability of the MTX reagent. In analytical mode, MASPIT was able to give concentration-dependent reporter signals for the established target proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the sensitivity obtained with the new MTX reagent was significantly stronger than that of a previously used non-regiomeric conjugate mixture. Finally, the FK506 MFC was explored in a cellular array screen for targets of FK506. Out of a pilot collection of nearly 2000 full-length human ORF preys, FKBP12, the established target of FK506, emerged as the prey protein that gave the highest increase in luciferase activity. This indicates that our newly developed synthetic strategy for the straightforward generation of MFCs is a promising asset to uncover new intracellular targets using MASPIT cellular array screening.
10388743	Probing the structural changes in the light chain of human coagulation factor VIIa due to tissue factor association.	The crystallographic structure of human coagulation factor VIIa/tissue factor complex bound with calcium ions was used to model the solution structure of the light chain of factor VIIa (residues 1-142) in the absence of tissue factor. The Amber force field in conjunction with the particle mesh Ewald summation method to accommodate long-range electrostatic interactions was used in the trajectory calculations. The estimated TF-free solution structure was then compared with the crystal structure of factor VIIa/tissue factor complex to estimate the restructuring of factor VIIa due to tissue factor binding. The solution structure of the light chain of factor VIIa in the absence of tissue factor is predicted to be an extended domain structure similar to that of the tissue factor-bound crystal. Removal of the EGF1-bound calcium ion is shown by simulation to lead to minor structural changes within the EGF1 domain, but also leads to substantial relative reorientation of the Gla and EGF1 domains.
13129658	Schizophrenia is not associated with DRD4 48-base-pair-repeat length or individual alleles: results of a meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: The gene DRD4, coding for dopamine receptor D4, was considered a candidate for association with schizophrenia based on its upregulation in postmortem schizophrenic brain and affinity for clozapine. Many studies sought allelic association of a 48-base-pair repeat in DRD4 exon 3 with schizophrenia, but found no strong evidence for a relationship. The present work sought to determine if this observation reflected the true absence of association or the low power of individual studies. METHODS: We performed four meta-analyses, sequentially considering the two-, four-, and seven-repeat alleles as risk alleles, and then considering repeat length of the 48-base-pair segment as a risk factor. Each meta-analysis included at least 2,300 cases and 2,100 controls from 14-16 studies. RESULTS: The pooled odds ratio from each analysis approximated 1.0, and none were significant. Heterogeneity was not observed, although gender moderated the effects of repeat length and the seven-repeat allele. CONCLUSIONS: Despite over 90% power to detect a significant odds ratio of 1.4 or less, none was observed. This polymorphism seems not to influence risk for most schizophrenia cases; however, a sex-dependent relationship, or a role in some clinical features of the disorder, cannot be excluded and should be pursued experimentally.
23625915	Store-operated Ca2+ Entry (SOCE) Induced by Protease-activated Receptor-1 mediates STIM1 Phosphorylation to inhibit SOCE in Endothelial Cells through AMP-activated Protein Kinase and p38beta Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase.	The Ca2+ sensor STIM1 is crucial for activation of store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) through TRPC and Orai channels. STIM1 phosphorylation serves as an off-switch for SOCE. However, the signaling pathway for STIM1 phosphorylation is unknown. Here we show that SOCE activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK); its effector p38β mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38β MAPK) phosphorylates STIM1, thus inhibiting SOCE in human lung microvascular endothelial cells (ECs). Activation of AMPK using AICAR resulted in STIM1 phosphorylation on serine residues and prevented PAR-1-induced Ca2+ entry. Further, AICAR pretreatment blocked PAR-1-induced increase in permeability of mouse-lung microvessels. Activation of SOCE with thrombin caused phosphorylation of isoform α1, but not α2 of the AMPK catalytic subunit. Moreover, knockdown of AMPKα1 augmented SOCE induced by thrombin. Interestingly, SB203580, a selective inhibitor of p38 MAPK, blocked STIM1 phosphorylation and led to sustained STIM1-puncta formation and Ca2+ entry. Of the three p38 MAPK isoforms expressed in ECs, p38β knockdown prevented PAR-1-mediated STIM1 phosphorylation and potentiated SOCE. In addition, inhibition of the SOCE downstream target CaMKKβ or knockdown of AMPKα1 suppressed PAR-1-mediated phosphorylation of p38β and hence STIM1. Thus, our findings demonstrate that SOCE activates CaMKKβ-AMPKα1-p38β MAPK signaling to phosphorylate STIM1, thereby suppressing endothelial SOCE and permeability responses.
23151004	GPR55 and its interaction with membrane lipids: comparison with other endocannabinoid-binding receptors.	"A number of integral membrane G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) share common structural features (including palmytoilated aminoacid residues and consensus sequences specific for interaction with cholesterol) that allow them to interact with lipid rafts, membrane cholesterol-rich microdomains able to regulate GPCR signalling and functions. Among GPCRs, type-1 and type-2 cannabinoid receptors, the molecular targets of endocannabinoids (eCBs), control many physiological and pathological processes through the activation of several signal transduction pathways. Recently, the orphan GPR55 receptor has been proved to be activated by many eCBs, thus leading to the hypothesis that it might be the ""type-3"" cannabinoid receptor. While the biological activity of eCBs and the influence of membrane lipids on their functions are rather well established, information regarding GPR55 is still scarce and often controversial. Based on this background, here we shall review current data about GPR55 pharmacology and signalling, highlighting its involvement in several pathophysiological conditions. We shall also outline the structural features that allow GPR55 to interact with cholesterol and to associate with lipid rafts; how the latter lipid microdomains impact the biological activity of GPR55 is also addressed, as well as their potential for the discovery of new therapeutics useful for the treatment of those human diseases that might be associated with alterations of GPR55 activity."
23047001	Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of benzothiazepinones (BTZs) as novel non-ATP competitive inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β).	Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) plays a key role in type II diabetes and Alzheimer's diseases, to which non-ATP competitive inhibitors represent an effectively therapeutical approach due to their good specificity. Herein, a series of small molecules benzothiazepinones (BTZs) as novel non-ATP competitive inhibitors of GSK-3β have been designed and synthesized. The in vitro evaluation performed by luminescent assay showed most BTZ derivatives have inhibitory effects in micromolar scale. Among them compounds 6l, 6t and 6v have the IC50 values of 25.0 μM, 27.8 μM and 23.0 μM, respectively. Moreover 6v is devoid of any inhibitory activity in the assays to other thirteen protein kinases. Besides, SAR is analyzed and a hypothetical enzymatic binding mode is proposed by molecular docking study, which would be useful for new candidates design.
11159707	Molecular and pharmacological evidence for modulation of kinin B(1) receptor expression by endogenous glucocorticoids hormones in rats.	1. The effect of endogenous glucocorticoid hormones on the expression of rat B(1) receptors was examined by means of molecular and pharmacological functional approaches. 2. Rats were adrenalectomized (ADX), and 7 days after this procedure the intradermal injection of B(1) receptor agonist des-Arg(9)-BK produced a significant increase in the paw volume, while only a weak effect was observed in sham-operated animals. A similar increase in the contractile responses mediated by B(1) agonist des-Arg(9)-BK was also observed in the rat portal vein in vitro. 3. Chemical ADX performed with mitotane (a drug that reduces corticosteroid synthesis) produced essentially the same up-regulation of B(1) receptors as that observed in ADX rats. 4. The modulation of B(1) receptor expression was evaluated by ribonuclease protection assay, employing mRNA obtained from the lungs and paw of ADX rats. 5. Additionally, both paw oedema and contraction of portal vein mediated by B(1) agonist des-Arg(9)-BK in ADX rats, were markedly inhibited by treatment with dexamethasone, or COX-2 inhibitor meloxican, or with the NF-kappaB inhibitor PDTC. Interestingly, the same degree of inhibition was achieved when the animals were treated with a combination of submaximal doses of dexamethasone and PDTC. 6. The involvement of NF-kappaB pathway was further confirmed by mobility shift assay using nuclear extracts from lung, paw and heart of ADX rats. It was also confirmed that the treatment of ADX rats with dexamethasone, PDTC or dexamethasone plus PDTC completely inhibit NF-kappaB activation caused by absence of endogenous glucucorticoid. 7. Together, the results of the present study provide, for the first time, molecular and pharmacological evidence showing that B(1) kinin receptor expression can be regulated through endogenous glucocorticoids by a mechanism dependent on NF-kappaB pathway. Clinical significance of the present findings stem from evidence showing the importance of B(1) kinin receptors in the mediation of inflammatory and pain related responses.
15151902	Involvement of G protein betagamma-subunits in diverse signaling induced by G(i/o)-coupled receptors: study using the Xenopus oocyte expression system.	We studied the functions of betagamma-subunits of G(i/o) protein using the Xenopus oocyte expression system. Isoproterenol (ISO) elicited cAMP production and slowly activating Cl(-) currents in oocytes expressing beta(2)-adrenoceptor and the protein kinase A-dependent Cl(-) channel encoded by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), [d-Ala(2), d-Leu(5)]-enkephalin (DADLE), and baclofen enhanced ISO-induced cAMP levels and CFTR currents in oocytes expressing beta(2)-adrenoceptor-CFTR and 5-HT(1A) receptor (5-HT(1A)R), delta-opioid receptor, or GABA(B) receptor, respectively. 5-HT also enhanced pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide (PACAP) 38-induced cAMP levels and CFTR currents in oocytes expressing PACAP receptor, CFTR and 5-HT(1A)R. The 5-HT-induced enhancement of G(s)-coupled receptor-mediated currents was abrogated by pretreatment with pertussis toxin (PTX) and coexpression of G transducin alpha (G(t)alpha). The 5-HT-induced enhancement was further augmented by coexpression of the Gbetagamma-activated form of adenylate cyclase (AC) type II but not AC type III. Thus betagamma-subunits of G(i/o) protein contribute to the enhancement of G(s)-coupled receptor-mediated responses. 5-HT and DADLE did not elicit any currents in oocytes expressing 5-HT(1A)R or delta-opioid receptor alone. They elicited Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) currents in oocytes coexpressing these receptors with the Gbetagamma-activated form of phospholipase C (PLC)-beta2 but not with PLC-beta1. These currents were inhibited by pretreatment with PTX and coexpression of G(t)alpha, suggesting that betagamma-subunits of G(i/o) protein activate PLC-beta2 and then cause intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization. Our results indicate that betagamma-subunits of G(i/o) protein participate in diverse intracellular signals, enhancement of G(s)-coupled receptor-mediated responses, and intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization.
23627352	Design, synthesis and molecular modeling of novel pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine analogs as antifolates: Application of Buchwald-Hartwig aminations of heterocycles.	Opportunistic infections caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii (P. jirovecii, pj), Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii, tg) and Mycobacterium avium (M. avium, ma) are the principal causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The absence of any animal models for human Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and the lack of crystal structures of pjDHFR and tgDHFR make the design of inhibitors challenging. A novel series of pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidines as selective and potent DHFR inhibitors against these opportunistic infections are presented. Buchwald-Hartwig coupling reaction of substituted anilines with pivaloyl protected 2,4-diamino-6-bromo-pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine was successfully explored to synthesize these analogs. Compound 26 was the most selective inhibitor with excellent potency against pjDHFR. Molecular modeling studies with a pjDHFR homology model explained the potency and selectivity of 26. Structural data are also reported for 26 with pcDHFR and 16 and 22 with variants of pcDHFR.
12388412	Localization of the ammonium transporter proteins RhBG and RhCG in mouse kidney.	Ammonia is both produced and transported by renal epithelial cells, and it regulates renal ion transport. Recent studies have identified a family of putative ammonium transporters; mRNA for two members of this family, Rh B-glycoprotein (RhBG) and Rh C-glycoprotein (RhCG), is expressed in the kidney. The purpose of this study was to determine the cellular location of RhBG and RhCG protein in the mouse kidney. We generated RhBG- and RhCG-specific anti-peptide antibodies. Immunoblot analysis confirmed that both proteins were expressed in the mouse kidney. RhBG localization with immunohistochemistry revealed discrete basolateral labeling in the connecting segment (CNT) and in the majority of initial collecting tubule (ICT) and cortical collecting duct (CCD) cells. In the outer medullary collecting duct (OMCD) and inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) only a subpopulation of cells exhibited basolateral immunoreactivity. Colocalization of RhBG with carbonic anhydrase II, the thiazide-sensitive transporter, and the anion exchangers AE1 and pendrin demonstrated RhBG immunoreactivity in all CNT cells and all CCD and ICT principal cells. In the ICT and CCD, basolateral RhBG immunoreactivity is also present in A-type intercalated cells but not in pendrin-positive CCD intercalated cells. In the OMCD and IMCD, only intercalated cells exhibit RhBG immunoreactivity. Immunoreactivity for a second putative ammonium transporter, RhCG, was present in the apical region of cells with almost the same distribution as RhBG. However, RhCG immunoreactivity was present in all CCD cells, and it was present in outer stripe OMCD principal cells, in addition to OMCD and IMCD intercalated cells. Thus the majority of RhBG and RhCG protein expression is present in the same epithelial cell types in the CNT and collecting duct but with opposite polarity. These findings suggest that RhBG and RhCG may play important and cell-specific roles in ammonium transport and signaling in these regions of the kidney.
18381445	Statins increase p21 through inhibition of histone deacetylase activity and release of promoter-associated HDAC1/2.	Statins are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors broadly used for the control of hypercholesterolemia. Recently, they are reported to have beneficial effects on certain cancers. In this study, we show that statins inhibited the histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity and increased the accumulation of acetylated histone-H3 and the expression of p21(WAF/CIP) in human cancer cells. Computational modeling showed the direct interaction of the carboxylic acid moiety of statins with the catalytic site of HDAC2. In the subsequent enzymatic assay, it was shown that lovastatin inhibited HDAC2 activity competitively with a K(i) value of 31.6 micromol/L. Sp1 but not p53 sites were found to be the statins-responsive element shown by p21 luciferase-promoter assays. DNA affinity protein binding assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed the dissociation of HDAC1/2 and association of CBP, leading to the histone-H3 acetylation on the Sp1 sites of p21 promoter. In vitro cell proliferation and in vivo tumor growth were both inhibited by statins. These results suggest a novel mechanism for statins through abrogation of the HDAC activity and promoter histone-H3 acetylation to regulate p21 expression. Therefore, statins might serve as novel HDAC inhibitors for cancer therapy and chemoprevention.
11054378	Suppression of NF-kappaB activity by sulfasalazine is mediated by direct inhibition of IkappaB kinases alpha and beta.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Activation of NF-kappaB/Rel has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Various drugs used in the treatment of IBD, such as glucocorticoids, 5-aminosalicylic acid, and sulfasalazine, interfere with NF-kappaB/Rel signaling. The aim of this study was to define the molecular mechanism by which sulfasalazine inhibits NF-kappaB activation. METHODS: The effects of sulfasalazine and its moieties on NF-kappaB signaling were evaluated using electromobility shift, transfection, and immune complex kinase assays. The direct effect of sulfasalazine on IkappaB kinase (IKK) activity was investigated using purified recombinant IKK-alpha and -beta proteins. RESULTS: NF-kappaB/Rel activity induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, or overexpression of NF-kappaB-inducing kinase, IKK-alpha, IKK-beta, or constitutively active IKK-alpha and IKK-beta mutants was inhibited dose dependently by sulfasalazine. Sulfasalazine inhibited tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced activation of endogenous IKK in Jurkat T cells and SW620 colon cells, as well as the catalytic activity of purified IKK-alpha and IKK-beta in vitro. In contrast, the moieties of sulfasalazine, 5-aminosalicylic acid, and sulfapyridine or 4-aminosalicylic acid had no effect. Activation of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) 1 and 2, c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) 1, and p38 was unaffected by sulfasalazine. The decrease in substrate phosphorylation by IKK-alpha and -beta is associated with a decrease in autophosphorylation of IKKs and can be antagonized by excess adenosine triphosphate. CONCLUSIONS: These data identify sulfasalazine as a direct inhibitor of IKK-alpha and -beta by antagonizing adenosine triphosphate binding. The suppression of NF-kappaB activation by inhibition of the IKKs contributes to the well-known anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of sulfasalazine.
23625779	Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles Act as a Self-Adjuvant for Ovalbumin Model Antigen in Mice.	Immunization to the model protein antigen ovalbumin (OVA) is investigated using MCM-41 mesoporous silica nanoparticles as a novel vaccine delivery vehicle and adjuvant system in mice. The effects of amino surface functionalization and adsorption time on OVA adsorption to nanoparticles are assessed. Amino-functionalized MCM-41 (AM-41) shows an effect on the amount of OVA binding, with 2.5-fold increase in binding capacity (72 mg OVA/g AM-41) compared to nonfunctionalized MCM-41 (29 mg OVA/g MCM-41). Immunization studies in mice with a 10 μg dose of OVA adsorbed to AM-41 elicits both antibody and cell-mediated immune responses following three subcutaneous injections. Immunizations at a lower 2 μg dose of OVA adsorbed to AM-41 particles results in an antibody response but not cell-mediated immunity. The level of antibody responses following immunization with nanoformulations containing either 2 μg or 10 μg of OVA are only slightly lower than that in mice which receive 50 μg OVA adjuvanted with QuilA, a crude mixture of saponins extracted from the bark of the Quillaja saponaria Molina tree. This is a significant result, since it demonstrates that AM-41 nanoparticles are self-adjuvanting and elicit immune responses at reduced antigen doses in vivo compared to a conventional delivery system. Importantly, there are no local or systemic negative effects in animals injected with AM-41. Histopathological studies of a range of tissue organs show no changes in histopathology of the animals receiving nanoparticles over a six week period. These results establish the biocompatible MCM-41 silica nanoparticles as a new method for vaccine delivery which incorporates a self-adjuvant effect.
14633536	The effect of antiemetics on pupillary reflex dilation during epidural/general anesthesia.	UNLABELLED: The effect of dopamine D2 receptor antagonists, such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol, on pupil size in awake subjects suggests that these drugs might also alter pupillary reflex dilation and pupil size during general anesthesia. Forty-seven patients undergoing lower abdominal surgery under combined epidural/general anesthesia were randomized to receive one of the 5 following open labeled drugs: 10 mL saline, 0.13 mg/kg ondansetron, 0.25 mg/kg metoclopramide, 0.5 mg/kg metoclopramide, or 0.02 mg/kg droperidol. Three measurements of reflex dilation were taken at 5-min intervals and after the last measurement (time 0) the drug was administered. Measurements were then taken 5, 10, 20, and 40 min after I.V. drug administration. Reflex dilation was induced by intermittent noxious stimulation of the C5 dermatome with a tetanic electric current (60-70 mamp, 100 Hz, 3-s duration) after a stable level of epidural analgesia had been established with 3/8% bupivacaine and maintained with a continuous infusion. Metoclopramide produced a small decrease in pupil diameter and transiently depressed reflex dilation, whereas droperidol decreased pupil size at 10 min and depressed reflex dilation throughout the 40-min study period. Maximal change in reflex dilation was -6.6 +/- 3.3 mm-sec after droperidol. Ondansetron had no effect on pupil diameter or reflex dilation. When pupillary diameter measurements are used to gauge opioid levels during experimental conditions or during surgical anesthesia, antiemetic medication acting on the dopamine D2 receptor should be avoided. IMPLICATIONS: Miosis is often considered an effect of opioid administration during general anesthesia, but other drugs, such as antiemetics, might produce a similar effect on the pupil. This study demonstrates that 2 antiemetics, droperidol and metoclopramide, constrict the pupil and block the pupillary dilation brought about by nociceptive stimuli.
23438471	The circadian clock circuitry and the AHR signaling pathway in physiology and pathology.	Life forms populating the Earth must face environmental challenges to assure individual and species survival. The strategies predisposed to maintain organismal homeostasis and grant selective advantage rely on anticipatory phenomena facing periodic modifications, and compensatory phenomena facing unpredictable changes. Biological processes bringing about these responses are respectively driven by the circadian timing system, a complex of biological oscillators entrained to the environmental light/dark cycle, and by regulatory and metabolic networks that precisely direct the body's adjustments to variations of external conditions and internal milieu. A critical role in organismal homeostatic functions is played by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) complex, which senses environmental and endogenous compounds, influences metabolic responses controlling phase I/II gene expression, and modulates vital phenomena such as development, inflammation and adaptive immunity. A physiological cross-talk between circadian and AHR signaling pathways has been evidenced. The alteration of AHR signaling pathway deriving from genetic damage with polymorphisms or mutations, or produced by exogenous or endogenous AHR activation, and chronodisruption caused by mismatch between the body's internal clock and geophysical time/social schedules, are capable of triggering pathological mechanisms involved in metabolic, immune-related and neoplastic diseases. On the other hand, the molecular components of the circadian clock circuitry and AHR signaling pathway may represent useful tools for preventive interventions and valuable targets of therapeutic approaches.
23261589	Salsolinol induced apoptotic changes in neural stem cells: amelioration by neurotrophin support.	Salsolinol (SAL), a catechol isoquinoline has invited considerable attention due to its structural similarity with dopaminergic neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Its high endogenous presence in Parkinsonian brain implicated its possible association with the disease process. SAL is also present in alcohol beverages and certain food materials and can get access to brain especially in conditions of immature or impaired BBB. Besides this, the effect of SAL on neural stem cells (NSCs) which are potential candidates for adult neurogenesis and transplantation mediated rejuvenating attempts for Parkinson's disease (PD) brain has not been known so far. NSCs in both the cases have to overcome suppressive cues of diseased brain for their survival and function. In this study we explored the toxicity of SAL toward NSCs focusing on apoptosis and status of PI3K survival signaling. NSCs cultured from embryonic day 11 rat fetal brain including those differentiated to TH(+ve) colonies, when challenged with SAL (1-100μM), elicited a concentration and time dependent cell death/loss of mitochondrial viability. 10μM SAL on which significant mitochondrial impairment initiated was further used to study mechanism of toxicity. Morphological impairment, enhanced TUNEL positivity, cleaved caspase-3 and decreased Bcl-2:Bax suggested apoptosis. Sal toxicity coincided with reduced pAkt level and its downstream effectors: pCREB, pGSK-3β, Bcl-2 and neurotrophins GDNF, BDNF suggesting repressed PI3K/Akt signaling. Multiple neurotrophic factor support in the form of Olfactory Ensheathing Cell's Conditioned Media (OEC CM) potentially protected NSCs against SAL through activating PI3K/Akt pathway. This was confirmed on adding LY294002 the PI3K inhibitor which abolished the protection. We inferred that SAL exerts substantial toxicity toward NSCs. These findings will lead to better understanding of endogenous threats that might affect the fate of transplanted NSCs and their probable antidotes.
23406497	Switchable Elastin-Like Polypeptides that Respond to Chemical Inducers of Dimerization.	Elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) are protein polymers that reversibly phase separate in response to increased temperature, pressure, concentration, ionic strength, and molecular weight. If it were possible to engineer their phase separation to respond to specific molecular substrates, ELP fusion proteins might be engineered as biosensors, smart biomaterials, diagnostic imaging agents, and targeted therapies. What has been lacking is a strategy to design ELPs to respond to specific substrates. To address this deficiency, we report that ELP fusion proteins phase separate in response to chemical inducers of dimerization (CID). The rationale is that ELP phase separation depends on molecular weight, concentration, and local hydrophobicity; therefore, processes that affect these properties, including noncovalent dimerization, can be tuned to produce isothermal phase separation. To test this hypothesis, constructs were evaluated consisting of an immunophilin: human FK-506 binding protein 12 (FKBP) attached to an ELP. Under stoichiometric binding of a CID, the fusion protein homodimerizes and triggers phase separation. This dimerization is reversible upon saturation with excess CID or competitive binding of a small lipophilic macrolide to FKBP. By modulating the ELP molecular weight, phase separation was tuned for isothermal response to CID at physiological ionic strength and temperature (37 °C). To interpret the relationship between transition temperature and equilibrium binding constants, an empirical mathematical model was employed. To the best of our knowledge, this report is the first demonstration of reversible ELP switching in response to controlled dimerization. Due to its simplicity, this strategy may be useful to design ELP fusion proteins that respond to specific dimeric biological entities.
9690036	The role of renal chloride channel mutations in kidney stone disease and nephrocalcinosis.	Recent advances in molecular biology have characterised a new class of chloride channels (CLCs) that are referred to as voltage-gated CLCs. To date nine such voltage-gated CLCs (CLC-1 to CLC-7, CLC-Ka and CLC-Kb, which are encoded by the genes CLCN1 to CLCN7, CLC-Ka and CLC-Kb, respectively) have been identified in mammals. Mutations in two of these, CLC-5 and CLC-Kb, have been defined in the hypercalciuric nephrolithiasis disorders of Dent's disease and a form of Bartter's syndrome, respectively. In addition, other forms of Bartter's syndrome have been defined with mutations involving the bumetanide-sensitive sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter (NKCC2) and the potassium channel ROMK. Finally, mutations of the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride cotransporter (NCCT) are associated with Gitelman's syndrome, in which hypocalciuria and hypomagnesaemia are notable features. These molecular genetic studies have increased our understanding of the renal tubular mechanisms that regulate mineral homeostasis.
23239825	Differentiation of opioid drug effects by hierarchical multi-site phosphorylation.	Differences in the ability of opioid drugs to promote regulated endocytosis of μ-opioid receptors are related to their tendency to produce drug tolerance and dependence. Here we show that drug-specific differences in receptor internalization are determined by a conserved, 10-residue sequence in the receptor's carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail. Diverse opioids induce receptor phosphorylation at serine (S)375, present in the middle of this sequence, but opioids differ markedly in their ability to drive higher-order phosphorylation on flanking residues [threonine (T)370, T376, and T379]. Multi-phosphorylation is required for the endocytosis-promoting activity of this sequence and occurs both sequentially and hierarchically, with S375 representing the initiating site. Higher-order phosphorylation involving T370, T376, and T379 specifically requires GRK2/3 isoforms, and the same sequence controls opioid receptor internalization in neurons. These results reveal a biochemical mechanism differentiating the endocytic activity of opioid drugs.
1332478	Failure of ritodrine to prevent preterm labor in the sheep.	OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine whether continuous infusion of ritodrine could prevent preterm delivery in sheep. STUDY DESIGN: Sheep in preterm labor induced by RU 486 (mifepristone) received infusions of either ritodrine (n = 5) or saline solution (n = 5), and the progress of labor was monitored. beta 2-Adrenergic receptor density and function (agonist-induced cyclic adenosine monophosphate production) was measured in myometrial samples from both groups. RESULTS: Ritodrine initially inhibited labor contractions. This inhibition was only maintained for 16 hours, after which both the amplitude and frequency of electromyographic bursts and contractions returned. The failure of the myometrium to respond to ritodrine (desensitization) was associated with significant reductions in agonist-induced cyclic adenosine monophosphate production and beta 2-adrenergic receptor concentration in myometrial tissue collected from these animals compared with the saline solution-treated controls. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous infusion of ritodrine to sheep in preterm labor produces only a transient inhibition of contractions. This desensitization is caused by a down-regulation of myometrial beta 2-adrenergic receptors.
18655903	Peptide and non-peptide agonists and antagonists for the vasopressin and oxytocin V1a, V1b, V2 and OT receptors: research tools and potential therapeutic agents.	Oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (AVP) mediate their biological actions by acting on four known receptors: The OT (uterine) and the AVP V(1a) (vasopressor), V(1b) (pituitary), V(2) (renal) receptors and a fifth putative AVP V(1c)? (vasodilating) receptor. This presentation will summarize some highlights of the recent progress, in the design and synthesis of selective peptide agonists, antagonists, radioiodinated ligands, fluorescent ligands and bivalent ligands for these receptors. Here we present published and unpublished pharmacological data on the most widely used agonists, antagonists and labelled ligands. The pharmacological properties of promising new selective OT antagonists and V(1b) agonists are also presented. This review should serve as a useful guide for the selection of the most appropriate ligand for a given study. The current status of non-peptide OT and AVP antagonists and agonists is also summarized. The relative merits of peptide and non-peptide AVP and OT agonists and antagonists as: (1) research tools and (2) therapeutic agents will be evaluated. Many of the receptor selective peptide agonists and antagonists from this and other laboratories are far more widely used as pharmacological tools for studies on the peripheral and central effects of OT and AVP than their non-peptide counterparts. In addition to OT and to a lesser extent AVP (pitressin), a number of OT and AVP analogues; such as carbetocin (OT agonist) dDAVP (desmopressin, V(2) agonist), terlipressin (V(1a) agonist), felypressin (V(1a) agonist) and atosiban (Tractocile OT antagonist) are also in clinical use. Despite much early promise, no non-peptide V(1a) or OT antagonists are currently in clinical trials. While a number of orally active non-peptide V(2) antagonists (Vaptans); notably, Tolvaptan, Lixivaptan and Satavaptan, are currently in Phase III clinical trials; to date, only the mixed V(2)/V(1a), antagonist Conivaptan (Vaprisol), has been approved by the US FDA for clinical use (by i.v. administration), for the treatment of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia in hospitalized patients. Promising new non-peptide V(1b) and OT antagonists, as well as non-peptide V(2) and OT agonists are now in pre-clinical development.
7824160	Effect of the R(-) and S(+) isomers of MDA and MDMA on phosphatidyl inositol turnover in cultured cells expressing 5-HT2A or 5-HT2C receptors.	The effect of the R(-) and S(+) isomers of 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) and its N-methyl analog 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on [3H]inositol monophosphate accumulation was studied in cells expressing either 5-HT2A or 5-HT2C receptors. The isomers of MDA produced a concentration dependent increase in phosphatidyl inositol (PI) hydrolysis at the 5-HT2A receptors, with the R(-) isomer of MDA being more potent than the S(+) at the 5-HT2A receptor. The R(-) and S(+) isomers of MDMA were significantly less efficacious at the 5-HT2A receptor as compared to MDA; S(+)MDMA had no effect. At the 5-HT2C receptor, both R(-) and S(+)MDA were equipotent at stimulating PI hydrolysis, with the S(+) isomer of MDMA being more efficacious at the 5-HT2C receptor compared with the R(-) isomer. In all cases at both the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors, the affinities of the isomers of MDMA and MDA were at least 2-3 orders of magnitude less than 5-HT. Despite the weak effect of these compounds at the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors, these substituted amphetamines do possess intrinsic activity which may contribute to their neurotoxic effects when administered at high doses.
23443908	On the accuracy of explicitly correlated methods to generate potential energy surfaces for scattering calculations and clustering: application to the HCl-He complex.	We closely compare the accuracy of multidimensional potential energy surfaces (PESs) generated by the recently developed explicitly correlated coupled cluster (CCSD(T)-F12) methods in connection with the cc-pVXZ-F12 (X = D, T) and aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets and those deduced using the well-established orbital-based coupled cluster techniques employing correlation consistent atomic basis sets (aug-cc-pVXZ, X = T, Q, 5) and extrapolated to the complete basis set (CBS) limit. This work is performed on the benchmark rare gas-hydrogen halide interaction (HCl-He) system. These PESs are then incorporated into quantum close-coupling scattering dynamical calculations in order to check the impact of the accuracy of the PES on the scattering calculations. For this system, we deduced inelastic collisional data including (de-)excitation collisional and pressure broadening cross sections. Our work shows that the CCSD(T)-F12/aug-cc-pVTZ PES describes correctly the repulsive wall, the van der Waals minimum and long range internuclear distances whereas cc-pVXZ-F12 (X = D,T) basis sets are not diffuse enough for that purposes. Interestingly, the collision cross sections deduced from the CCSD(T)-F12/aug-cc-pVTZ PES are in excellent agreement with those obtained with CCSD(T)/CBS methodology. The position of the resonances and the general shape of these cross sections almost coincide. Since the cost of the electronic structure computations is reduced by several orders of magnitude when using CCSD(T)-F12/aug-cc-pVTZ compared to CCSD(T)/CBS methodology, this approach can be recommended as an alternative for generation of PESs of molecular clusters and for the interpretation of accurate scattering experiments as well as for a wide production of collisional data to be included in astrophysical and atmospherical models.
23296098	Endocrine disrupting effects of ochratoxin A at the level of nuclear receptor activation and steroidogenesis.	Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a mycotoxin and extrolite of fungi which has been reported in a range of foods. This study uses mammalian reporter gene assays (RGAs) with natural steroid receptors and the H295R steroidogenesis assay to assess the endocrine disrupting activity of OTA. At the receptor level, OTA (within a concentration range of 0.25-2500 ng/ml) did not induce an agonistic response in an oestrogen, androgen, progestagen or glucocorticoid RGA. An antagonistic effect was observed in all of the RGAs at the highest concentration tested (2500 ng/ml). However, while there was no significant cytotoxic effect observed in the MTT (thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide) cell viability assay at this concentration, there was a corresponding change in cell morphology which may be related to the resulting antagonistic effect. At the hormone production level, H295R cells were used as a steroidogenesis model and exposed to OTA (within a concentration range of 0.1-1000 ng/ml). Treatment of the cells with 1000 ng/ml OTA increased the production of estradiol (117±14 ng/ml) over 3 times that of the solvent control (36±9 pg/ml). Western blotting confirmed an increase in aromatase protein. Overall the results indicate that OTA does not appear to interact with steroid receptors but has the potential to cause endocrine disruption by interfering with steroidogenesis. This is the first study identifying the effect OTA may have on production of the steroid hormone estradiol.
23333093	Green tea catechin leads to global improvement among Alzheimer's disease-related phenotypes in NSE/hAPP-C105 Tg mice.	Amyloid β (Αβ) has been reported to be responsible for the functional and structural abnormalities of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through the induction of oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to determine whether or not treatment of transgenic (Tg) mice with green tea catechin (GTC), a radical scavenger, improves AD phenotypes. To test this, 7-month-old Tg mice were treated with a low (1 mg) or high (10 mg) dose of GTC for 6 months. Surprisingly, GTC-treated Tg mice exhibited significant decreases in behavioral impairment, Aβ-42 production, APP-C99/89 expression, γ-secretase component and Wnt protein levels, γ-secretase activity and MAPK activation. In contrast, the levels of APP-C83 protein and enzyme activities (α-secretase, neprilysin and Pin1) were elevated in the GTC-treated groups. Moreover, GTC-treated groups showed lower levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, whereas the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased. These results provide the first experimental evidence that GTC improves AD phenotypes, thereby suggesting that GTC can be used in the prevention of AD or treatment of AD patients.
23610086	Reactive Metabolite Trapping Studies on Imidazo- and 2-Methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-based Inverse Agonists of the Ghrelin Receptor.	The current study examined the bioactivation potential of ghrelin receptor inverse agonists, 1-(2-(2-chloro-4-(2H-1,2,3-triazol-2-yl)benzyl)-2,7-diazaspiro[3.5]nonan-7-yl)-2-(imidazo[2,1-b]thiazol-6-yl)ethanone (1) and 1-(2-(2-chloro-4-(2H-1,2,3-triazol-2-yl)benzyl)-2,7-diazaspiro[3.5]nonan-7-yl)-2-(2-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazol-6-yl)ethanone (2), containing a fused imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole motif in the core structure. Both compounds underwent oxidative metabolism in NADPH- and glutathione-supplemented human liver microsomes to yield glutathione conjugates, which was consistent with their bioactivation to reactive species. Mass spectral fragmentation and NMR analysis indicated that the site of attachment of the glutathionyl moiety in the thiol conjugates was on the thiazole ring within the bicycle. Two glutathione conjugates were discerned with the imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole derivative 1. One adduct was derived from the Michael addition of glutathione to a putative S-oxide metabolite of 1, whereas, the second adduct was formed via the reaction of a second glutathione molecule with the initial glutathione-S-oxide adduct. In the case of the 2-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole analog 2, glutathione conjugation occurred via an oxidative desulfation mechanism, possibly involving thiazole ring epoxidation as the rate-limiting step. Additional insights into the mechanism were obtained via 18O exchange and trapping studies with potassium cyanide. The mechanistic insights into the bioactivation pathways of 1 and 2 allowed the deployment of a rational chemical intervention strategy that involved replacement of the thiazole ring with a 1,2,4-thiadiazole group to yield -(2-(2-chloro-4-(2H-1,2,3-triazol-2-yl)benzyl)-2,7-diazaspiro[3.5]nonan-7-yl)-2-(2-methylimidazo[2,1-b][1,3,4]thiadiazol-6-yl)ethanone (3). These structural changes not only abrogated the bioactivation liability but also retained the attractive pharmacological attributes of the prototype agents.
23497878	The influence of Goishi tea on adipocytokines in obese mice.	This study investigated the influence of Goishi-tea on visceral fat weight in induced obese mice. Mice were divided into two main groups, normal and obesity. In obesity group, mice were fed with high-fat diet. Goishi-tea including its fractions (ethyl-acetate layer and water layer) was administrated in normal and obesity three sub-groups. Results showed no influence of Goishi-tea in normal group. However, visceral fat weight, size of adipose cell and cholesterol level were significantly decreased in obesity group fed Goishi-tea compared to control group. Moreover, adiponectin levels tended to increase and adipocytokines has significant values lower in obesity group fed Goishi-tea compared to control group. Interestingly, Goishi tea involved in the high-fat diet induced-obese mice can inhibit fat accumulation and maintain adiponectins without increasing tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6. It would be beneficial for the prevention of metabolic syndrome and obesity-related disorder.
23148920	Hydrogen sulfide increases nitric oxide production with calcium-dependent activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase in endothelial cells.	Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) was recently discovered to be synthesized in mammalian tissues by several different enzymes. Numerous studies have shown that H(2)S has vasodilator and antihypertensive effects in the cardiovascular system. However, intracellular mechanisms of the H(2)S-induced vasodilation and its interactions with other endothelium-derived relaxing factors, such as nitric oxide (NO), remain unclear. We investigated whether H(2)S directly regulates endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activity and NO production in endothelial cells. NaHS, a H(2)S donor, dose-dependently increased NO production in cultured endothelial cells. This effect was abolished by a calcium chelator (BAPTA-AM), but not by the absence of extracellular calcium. The NaHS-induced NO production was partially blocked by inhibitors of ryanodine receptor (dantrolene) or inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (xestospongin C). NaHS significantly increased intracellular calcium concentrations, and this effect was attenuated by dantrolene or xestospongin C. NaHS induced phosphorylation of eNOS at the activating phosphoserine residue 1179. The NaHS-induced eNOS phosphorylation and NO production were not affected by a PI3K/Akt inhibitor (wortmannin). The data of this study suggest that H(2)S directly acts on endothelial cells to induce eNOS activation and NO production by releasing calcium from the intracellular store in endoplasmic reticulum, which may explain one of mechanisms of its vasodilator function.
23591110	Discovery of aryl ureas and aryl amides as potent and selective histamine H3 receptor antagonists for the treatment of obesity (Part I).	A series of structurally novel aryl ureas was derived from optimization of the HTS lead as selective histamine H3 receptor (H3R) antagonists. The SAR was explored and the data obtained set up the starting point and foundation for further optimization. The most potent tool compounds, as exemplified by compounds 2l, 5b, 5d, and 5e, displayed antagonism potencies in the subnanomolar range in in vitro human-H3R FLIPR assays and rhesus monkey H3R binding assays.
17168665	Pharmacological inhibitors of Fatty Acid Synthase (FASN)--catalyzed endogenous fatty acid biogenesis: a new family of anti-cancer agents?	"The expression and activity of Fatty Acid Synthase (FASN; the sole enzyme capable of the reductive de novo synthesis of long-chain fatty acids from acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate -NADPH-) is extremely low in nearly all nonmalignant adult tissues, whereas it is significantly up-regulated or activated in many cancer types, thus creating the potential for a large therapeutic index. Since the pioneering observation that inhibition of FASN activity by the mycotoxin cerulenin preferentially kills cancer cells and retards the growth of tumors in xenografts models, numerous in vitro and in vivo studies have confirmed the potential of FASN as a target for antineoplastic intervention. Other FASN inhibitors such as the cerulenin derivative C75, the beta-lactone orlistat, the green tea polyphenol epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and other naturally occurring flavonoids (i.e., luteolin, quercetin, and kaempferol), as well as the antibiotic triclosan, have been identified and have been shown to limit cancer cell growth by inducing apoptotic cell death. Though the exact mode of action of these FASN inhibitors is under discussion, it has been revealed that depletion of end-product fatty acids, toxic intracellular accumulation of supra-physiological concentrations of the FASN substrate malonyl-CoA and/or limited membrane synthesis and/or functioning by altered production of phospholipids partitioning into detergent-resistant membrane microdomains (lipid raft-aggregates), can explain, at least in part, the cytostatic, cytotoxic as well as the apoptotic effects occurring upon pharmacological inhibition of FASN activity in cancer cells. Moreover, several cancer-associated molecular features including nonfunctioning p53, overexpression of the Her-2/neu (erbB-2) oncogene, and hyperactivation of the PI-3'K down-stream effector protein kinase B (AKT), appear to determine an exacerbated sensitivity to FASN inhibition-induced cancer cell death. Although few of these inhibitors are expected to be ""exclusively"" selective for FASN, the potential of FASN as a target for antineoplastic intervention has eventually been confirmed by RNA interference (RNAi)-knockdown of FASN. Certainly, future studies should definitely elucidate the ultimate biochemical link between FASN inhibition and cancer cell death. Although the combination of FASN structural complexity and until recently the lack of X-ray crystallography data of mammalian FASN created a significant challenge in the exploitation of FASN as a valuable target for drug development, it is hoped that the improvement in the selectivity and potency of forthcoming novel FASN-targeted small molecule inhibitors by taking advantage, for instance, of the recent 4.5 A resolution X-ray crystallographic map of mammalian FASN, will direct the foundation of a new family of chemotherapeutic agents in cancer history."
23475784	Developing Predictive Approaches to Characterize Adaptive Responses of the Reproductive Endocrine Axis to Aromatase Inhibition: II. Computational Modeling.	"Endocrine-disrupting chemicals can affect reproduction and development in humans and wildlife. We developed a computational model of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis in female fathead minnows to predict dose-response and time-course (DRTC) behaviors for endocrine effects of the aromatase inhibitor, fadrozole (FAD). The model describes adaptive responses to endocrine stress involving regulated secretion of a generic gonadotropin (LH/FSH) from the hypothalamic-pituitary complex. For model development, we used plasma 17β-estradiol (E2) concentrations and ovarian cytochrome P450 (CYP) 19A aromatase mRNA data from two time-course experiments, each of which included both an exposure and a depuration phase, and plasma E2 data from a third 4-day study. Model parameters were estimated using E2 concentrations for 0, 0.5, and 3 µg/l FAD exposure concentrations, and good fits to these data were obtained. The model accurately predicted CYP19A mRNA fold changes for controls and three FAD doses (0, 0.5, and 3 µg/l) and plasma E2 dose response from the 4-day study. Comparing the model-predicted DRTC with experimental data provided insight into how the feedback control mechanisms in the HPG axis mediate these changes: specifically, adaptive changes in plasma E2 levels occurring during exposure and ""overshoot"" occurring postexposure. This study demonstrates the value of mechanistic modeling to examine and predict dynamic behaviors in perturbed systems. As this work progresses, we will obtain a refined understanding of how adaptive responses within the vertebrate HPG axis affect DRTC behaviors for aromatase inhibitors and other types of endocrine-active chemicals and apply that knowledge in support of risk assessments."
23195954	Serine protease activity of calnuc: regulation by Zn2+ and G proteins.	"The functions of calnuc, a novel Ca(2+)-binding protein with multiple structural domains and diverse interacting partners, are yet unknown. We demonstrate unknown facets of calnuc, which is a serine protease in which Ser-378 of GXSXG motif, Asp-328 of DTG motif, and His-339 form the ""catalytic triad,"" locating the enzyme active site in the C-terminal region. Analogous to the active site of Zn(2+) carboxypeptidases, calnuc has two high affinity (K(d) ∼ 20 nm), well conserved Zn(2+)-binding sites near its N terminus, although it is inactive as a peptidase. Zn(2+) binding allosterically and negatively regulates the serine protease activity of calnuc, inhibition being caused by an ""open to close"" change in its conformation not seen upon Ca(2+) binding. Most strikingly, interaction with G protein α subunit completely inhibits the enzymatic activity of calnuc. We thus illustrate that G proteins and Zn(2+) act as two ""keys"" that control enzymatic activity of calnuc, arresting it in ""locked"" state. Calnuc, therefore, exists dynamically in two different forms, (i) as a Ca(2+)-binding protein in Zn(2+)-bound form and (ii) as a protease in Zn(2+)-free form, commissioning it to perform multiple functions."
23643483	Interactive effects of smoking and glutathione S-transferase polymorphisms on the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.	Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) protect cells against exogenous and endogenous oxidative stress. GST polymorphisms are associated with the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes mellitus (DM), especially in current-smokers. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a predictor of future CVD or DM, because oxidative stress contributes to their pathogenesis. This study investigated whether the combination of smoking status and GST genotypes could affect the risk for NAFLD. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted among 713 Japanese participants (458 males and 255 females) during a health screening program. The GSTM1 null, GSTT1 null, GSTP1 *A/*B or *B/*B and GSTA1 *A/*B or *B/*B genotypes were determined and deemed to be high-risk genotypes. The prevalence of NAFLD was 18.7%. Among never-smokers, carriers of one, and those of two or more high-risk GSTM1, GSTP1 or GSTA1 genotypes were at a higher risk for NAFLD than those who were not carriers [odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 2.6 (1.1-5.9) and 3.3 (1.3-8.1), respectively], and the risk was further increased among current-smokers [4.6 (1.6-13.0) and 5.4 (1.2-23.7), respectively]. This is the first report to show that the combination of current-smoking and harboring high-risk GSTM1, GSTP1 and/or GSTA1 genotypes is interactively associated with the risk of NAFLD.
23435160	Changes in A1C Levels Are Significantly Associated With Changes in Levels of the Cardiovascular Risk Biomarker hs-CRP: Results from SteP Study.	OBJECTIVEThe effect of therapeutic strategies on cardiovascular (CV) disease can be evaluated by monitoring changes in CV risk biomarkers. This study investigated the effect of a structured self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) protocol and the resulting improvements in glycemic control on changes in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in insulin-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSThe Structured Testing Program (STeP) study was a prospective, cluster-randomized, multicenter trial in which 483 poorly controlled, insulin-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to active control (ACG) or structured testing (STG) that included quarterly structured SMBG. Changes in A1C, hs-CRP, and glycemic variability (STG subjects only) were measured at baseline and quarterly.RESULTSReductions in geometric mean hs-CRP values were significantly greater in the STG group at months 3 (P = 0.005), 6 (P = 0.0003), and 12 (P = 0.04) than in the ACG group. STG patients at high CV risk (>3 mg/L) showed significantly greater reductions in hs-CRP levels than ACG patients at high CV risk: -3.64 mg/dL (95% CI -4.21 to -3.06) versus -2.18 mg/dL (-2.93 to -1.43), respectively (P = 0.002). There was a strong correlation between reductions in hs-CRP and A1C in both groups: standardized coefficient (β) was 0.25 for the entire cohort (P < 0.0001), 0.31 for STG (P < 0.0001), and 0.16 for ACG (P = 0.02).CONCLUSIONSReductions in hs-CRP level are associated with reductions in A1C but not reductions in lipids or glycemic variability. Comprehensive structured SMBG-based interventions that lower A1C may translate into improvements in CV risk, as evidenced by levels of the biomarker hs-CRP.
23479079	Sulfide induces apoptosis and Rho kinase-dependent cell blebbing in Jurkat cells.	Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a toxic gaseous substance, and accidental exposure to high concentrations of H2S has been reported to be lethal to humans. Inhaled and absorbed H2S is partially dissolved within the circulation and causes toxic effects on lymphocytes. However, the mechanisms involved in H2S toxicity have not been well documented. In this study, we examined the cellular uptake and injury of sulfide-exposed human T lymphocytes (Jurkat). Cells were exposed to a H2S donor, sodium hydroxysulfide (NaHS), at pH 6.0, 7.0, or 8.0 for 1 h at 37 °C in a sealed conical tube to avoid the loss of dissolved H2S gas. Cytotoxicity and cellular sulfide concentrations increased dramatically as the pH of the NaHS solution decreased. Sulfide enhanced the cleavage of caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and induced early cellular apoptosis. A pan-caspase inhibitor reduced sulfide-induced apoptosis. These results indicate that sulfide induces pH-dependent and caspase-dependent apoptosis. We also found that blebbing of the plasma membrane occurred in sulfide-exposed cells. Both ROCK-1 and ROCK-2 (Rho kinases) were activated by sulfide, and sulfide-induced cell blebbing was suppressed by a ROCK inhibitor, suggesting that a Rho pathway is involved in sulfide-induced blebbing in lymphocytes.
23614904	Bile Acid and Sterol Metabolism with Combined HMGCoA Reductase and PCSK9 Suppression.	PCSK9 inhibition markedly augments the LDL lowering action of statins. The combination is being evaluated for long-term effects on atherosclerotic disease outcomes. However, effects of combined treatment on hepatic cholesterol and bile acid metabolism have not yet been reported. To study this, PCSK9-Y119X mutant (knockout) and wild type mice were treated ± atorvastatin for 12 wks. Atorvastatin progressively lowered plasma LDL in each group, but no differences in liver cholesterol, cholesterol ester, or total bile acid concentrations, or in plasma total bile acid levels were seen. In contrast, atorvastatin increased fecal total bile acids (~2-fold, P<0.01) and cholesterol concentrations (~3-fold, P<0.01) vs. controls for both PCSK9-Y119X and wild type mice. All 14 individual bile acids resolved by LC-MS, including primary, secondary, and conjugated species, reflected similar increases. Expression of key liver bile acid synthesis genes CYP7A1 and CYP8B1 were ~2.5-fold higher with atorvastatin in both strains, but mRNA for liver bile acid export and reuptake transporters and conjugating enzymes were not unaffected. The data suggest that hepatocyte cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis is maintained with combined PCSK9 and HMGCoA reductase inhibition through efficient liver enzymatic conversion of LDL-derived cholesterol into bile acids and excretion of both, with undisturbed enterohepatic recycling.
11006278	Arachidonic acid and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs induce conformational changes in the human prostaglandin endoperoxide H2 synthase-2 (cyclooxygenase-2).	By using the technique of site-directed spin labeling combined with EPR spectroscopy, we have observed that binding of arachidonic acid and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs induces conformational changes in the human prostaglandin endoperoxide H(2) synthase enzyme (PGHS-2). Line shape broadening resulting from spin-spin coupling of nitroxide pairs introduced into the membrane-binding helices of PGHS-2 was used to calculate the inter-helical distances and changes in these distances that occur in response to binding various ligands. The inter-residue distances determined for the PGHS-2 holoenzyme using EPR were 1-7.9 A shorter than those of the crystal structure of the PGHS-2 holoenzyme. However, inter-helical distances calculated and determined by EPR for PGHS-2 complexed with arachidonic acid, flurbiprofen, and SC-58125 were in close agreement with those obtained from the cognate crystal structures. These results indicate that the structure of the solubilized PGHS-2 holoenzyme measured in solution differs from the crystal structure of PGHS-2 holoenzyme obtained by x-ray analysis. Furthermore, binding of ligands induces a conformational change in the holo-PGHS-2, converting it to a structure similar to those obtained by x-ray analysis. Proteolysis protection assays had previously provided circumstantial evidence that binding of heme and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs alters the conformation of PGHS, but the present experiments are the first to directly measure such changes. The finding that arachidonate can also induce a conformational change in PGHS-2 was unexpected, and the magnitude of changes suggests this structural flexibility may be integral to the cyclooxygenase catalytic mechanism.
11728431	Evidence for presynaptic cannabinoid CB(1) receptor-mediated inhibition of noradrenaline release in the guinea pig lung.	Using neurochemical method, evidence was obtained that cannabinoid CB(1) receptors are localized on noradrenergic terminals and their stimulation by WIN-55,212-2 reduces the release of [3H]noradrenaline evoked by axonal activity in a frequency-dependent manner. At stimulation rates of 1 and 3 Hz, there was significant inhibition of noradrenaline release, with IC(50) of WIN-55,212-2 41.5+/-2.6 and 320.5+/-28.2 nM, for 1 and 3 Hz, respectively. Cannabinoid CB(1) receptor antagonist SR 141716A completely prevented WIN-55,212-2 from reducing the release. The release of noradrenaline is negatively modulated by presynaptic alpha(2)-adrenoceptors. Because BRL-44408, an alpha(2B)-adrenoceptor, and prazosin, an alpha(1)- and alpha(2B)-adrenoceptor antagonist, both increased the release of [(3)H]noradrenaline, it seems likely that the alpha(2B) subtype is responsible for the negative feedback modulation of noradrenaline release. In the presence of alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonism, cannabinoid CB(1) receptor activation by WIN-55,212-2 was much more effective in inhibiting the release of [(3)H]noradrenaline. Using a specific antibody against the C-terminus of the rat cannabinoid CB(1) receptor and also against neuropeptide Y, ultrastructural evidence was obtained that cannabinoid CB(1) receptors are exclusively localized on neuropeptide Y-positive noradrenergic varicosities. Since the sympathetic innervation of the human airway smooth muscle is sparse, and mainly the circulating adrenaline relaxes the airways via activation of beta(2)-adrenoceptor localized on the smooth muscle, it is suggested that inhibition of noradrenaline release by cannabinoids, and the subsequent bronchospasm, may be limited to those cases when noradrenaline released from sympathetic varicosities is involved in airway relaxation.
11256847	Preclinical and clinical pharmacology of Rosuvastatin, a new 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor.	Rosuvastatin (formerly ZD4522) is a new 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor (statin) with distinct pharmacologic properties. Compared with most other statins, it is relatively hydrophilic, similar in this respect to pravastatin. Rosuvastatin has been shown to be a comparatively potent inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase activity in a purified preparation of the catalytic domain of the human enzyme, as well as in rat and human hepatic microsomes. In rat hepatocytes, rosuvastatin was found to have significantly higher potency as an inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis than 5 other statins. Rosuvastatin was approximately 1,000-fold more potent in rat hepatocytes than in rat fibroblasts. Further studies in rat hepatocytes demonstrated that rosuvastatin is taken up into these cells by a high-affinity active uptake process. Rosuvastatin was also taken up selectively into the liver after intravenous administration in rats. Potent and prolonged HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity has been demonstrated after oral administration to rats and dogs. Pharmacokinetic studies in humans using oral doses of 5 to 80 mg showed that maximum plasma concentrations and areas under the concentration-time curve are approximately linear with dose. The terminal half-life is approximately 20 hours. Studies with human hepatic microsomes and human hepatocytes have suggested little or no metabolism via the cytochrome P-450 3A4 isoenzyme. On the basis of these observations, it is suggested that rosuvastatin has the potential to exert a profound effect on atherogenic lipoproteins.
23558678	Annexin A2 regulates β1 integrin internalization and intestinal epithelial cell migration.	The gastrointestinal epithelium functions as an important barrier that separates luminal contents from the underlying tissue compartment and is vital in maintaining mucosal homeostasis. Mucosal wounds in inflammatory disorders compromise the critical epithelial barrier. In response to injury, intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) rapidly migrate to reseal wounds. We have previously observed that a membrane associated, Actin binding protein, Annexin A2 (AnxA2), is up-regulated in migrating IECs and plays an important role in promoting wound closure. To identify the mechanisms by which AnxA2 promotes IEC movement and wound closure we used a loss of function approach. AnxA2 specific shRNA was utilized to generate IECs with stable down-regulation of AnxA2. Loss of AnxA2 inhibited IEC migration while promoting enhanced cell-matrix adhesion. These functional effects were associated with increased levels of β1 integrin protein, which is reported to play an important role in mediating the cell-matrix adhesive properties of epithelial cells. Since cell migration requires dynamic turnover of integrin based adhesions, we tested if AnxA2 modulates internalization of cell surface β1 integrin required for forward cell movement. Indeed, pulse-chase biotinylation experiments in IECs lacking AnxA2 demonstrated a significant increase in cell surface β1 integrin that was accompanied by decreased β1 integrin internalization and degradation. These findings support an important role of AnxA2 in controlling dynamics of β1 integrin at the cell surface that in turn is required for the active turnover of cell-matrix associations, cell migration and wound closure.
11985583	Purification and biochemical characterization of some of the properties of recombinant human kynureninase.	Recombinant human kynureninase (L-kynurenine hydrolase, EC 3.7.1.3) was purified to homogeneity (60-fold) from Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells infected with baculovirus containing the kynureninase gene. The purification protocol comprised ammonium sulfate precipitation and several chromatographic steps, including DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B, hydroxyapatite, strong anionic and cationic separations. The purity of the enzyme was determined by SDS/PAGE, and the molecular mass verified by MALDI-TOF MS. The monomeric molecular mass of 52.4 kDa determined was > 99.99% of the predicted molecular mass. A UV absorption spectrum of the holoenzyme resulted in a peak at 432 nm. The optimum pH was 8.25 and the enzyme displayed a strong dependence on the ionic strength of the buffer for optimum activity. This cloned enzyme was highly specific for 3-hydroxykynurenine (Km = 3.0 microm +/- 0.10) and was inhibited by L-kynurenine (Ki = 20 microm), d-kynurenine (Ki = 12 microm) and a synthetic substrate analogue D,L-3,7-dihydroxydesaminokynurenine (Ki = 100 nm). The activity/concentration profile for kynureninase from this source was sigmoidal in all instances. There appeared to be partial inhibition by substrate, and excess pyridoxal 5'-phosphate was found to be inhibitory.
15869323	Ramelteon: TAK 375.	Ramelteon [TAK 375] is a melatonin (MT1/MT2) receptor agonist that is being developed by Takeda as a treatment for sleep disorders. It is undergoing regulatory review in the US, phase III trials in Europe, and phase II trials in Japan for the treatment of insomnia. Phase II trials are also being conducted in the US for the treatment of circadian rhythm sleep disordersIn September 2004, Takeda submitted an NDA to the US FDA for ramelteon for the treatment of insomnia. In May 2003, data presented at the 156th Annual Meeting of the American Psychiatric Association report that ramelteon is highly selective for the MT1 receptor, and has greater affinity, selectivity and potency than melatonin.
11840795	[Immune suppression by combination therapy with basiliximab and cyclosporin in high risk keratoplasty. A pilot study].	BACKGROUND: The risk of postoperative immune reaction/transplant rejection is increased in the presence of distinct risk factors. In these situations, the use of established immunosuppressive agents (steroids, cyclosporin) is indicated. However, immune reactions can occur despite this therapy. Basiliximab is a monoclonal antibody with a high specific binding affinity to the IL-2 receptor of activated T-cells. After renal transplantation, the combination therapy with basiliximab and cyclosporin reduces the risk of acute rejection by 30% against placebo. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of complementary immune suppression with the IL-2 synthesis inhibitor cyclosporin and the IL-2 receptor antagonist basiliximab on the incidence of transplant rejection after high-risk keratoplasty. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In an open pilot study, seven patients with high-risk keratoplasty were treated with basiliximab perioperatively and cyclosporin postoperatively. All patients had penetrating keratoplasty with a non-HLA-matched corneal graft. RESULTS: Seven patients were operated on from 12/98 through 12/99 with a corneal transplant diameter between 7.1 and 9.5 mm. Risk factors included extensive corneal neovascularization in all patients (indications for surgery: 4 cases with corneal scars after herpetic disease, 2 cases with conditions after alkali burns, 1 case with corneal ulceration after thermal burn). During the follow-up of 14-25 months, no immune reaction has occurred, and all transplants are clear. The mean visual acuity increased from 0.04 to 0.41 postoperatively. DISCUSSION: The preliminary data on a combination therapy with basiliximab and cyclosporin are promising. For further evaluation a prospective multicenter study is planned.
9480897	Identification of cDNAs encoding two human alpha class glutathione transferases (GSTA3 and GSTA4) and the heterologous expression of GSTA4-4.	The Expressed Sequence Tag database has been searched for examples of previously undescribed human Alpha class glutathione transferases. An incomplete transcript of the previously described GSTA3 gene was identified in a cDNA library derived from 8-9 week placenta. This indicates that the GSTA3 gene is functional and is possibly under specific developmental regulation. A second cDNA, termed GSTA4, was identified in a brain cDNA library. The encoded GSTA4-4 enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli and was found to be immunologically distinct from GSTA1-1 and to have high activity with alk-2-enals. Although GSTA4-4 appears to be functionally similar to the mouse GST5.7 and rat GST8-8 Alpha class enzymes, sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analysis suggest that GSTA4-4 may be a member of a distinct Alpha class subgroup.
10530931	Synthesis and antagonistic activity at muscarinic receptor subtypes of some 2-carbonyl derivatives of diphenidol.	A series of 2-carbonyl analogues of the muscarinic antagonist diphenidol bearing 1-substituents of different lipophilic, electronic, and steric properties was synthesized and their affinity for the M2 and M3 muscarinic receptor subtypes was evaluated by functional tests. Two derivatives (2g and 2d) showed an M2-selective profile which was confirmed by functional tests on the M1 and M4 receptors. A possible relationship between M2 selectivity and lipophilicity of the 1-substituent was suggested by structure-activity analysis. This work showed that appropriate structural modification of diphenidol can lead to M2-selective muscarinic antagonists of possible interest in the field of Alzheimer's disease.
16966686	RRM1 modulated in vitro and in vivo efficacy of gemcitabine and platinum in non-small-cell lung cancer.	PURPOSE: RRM1 encodes the regulatory subunit of ribonucleotide reductase and is a molecular target of gemcitabine. Previous studies showed increased RRM1 expression on continuous exposure of cell lines to gemcitabine and suggested improved survival for patients with low as opposed to high tumoral RRM1 expression when treated with gemcitabine-containing chemotherapy. However, the principal hypothesis that intratumoral levels of gene expression are associated with disease response has not been addressed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We constructed genetically modified lung cancer cell lines with increased and decreased RRM1 expression to investigate the in vitro 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for gemcitabine, cisplatin, and carboplatin. A prospective phase II clinical trial in patients with locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer was conducted with pretreatment tumor collection for determination of RRM1 and ERCC1 expression by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The levels of gene expression were correlated with tumor response after two cycles of gemcitabine and carboplatin. RESULTS: In cell lines with a genetically engineered 15-fold RRM1 expression range, the gemcitabine IC50 had a 100-fold range, and the cisplatin and carboplatin IC50 had a two-fold range. They were highest in constructs with high RRM1 expression. In the prospective clinical trial, RRM1 expression was significantly (P = .002) and inversely correlated (r = -0.498) with disease response. ERCC1 expression showed a similar trend (P = .099). CONCLUSION: The results strongly suggest that tumoral RRM1 expression is a major predictor of disease response to gemcitabine/platinum chemotherapy. ERCC1 expression is predictive of response albeit to a lesser degree.
7944828	2-(2-Aminoethyl)-quinoline (D-1997): a novel agonist at 5-hydroxytryptamine1-like receptors in the canine basilar artery.	This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms involved in the contractile effects produced by the novel quinoline derivative, 2-(2-aminoethyl)-quinoline (D-1997), in the canine isolated basilar artery. For comparison, the effects of D-1997 were also evaluated on rat aorta. Canine basilar artery and rat aortic rings were prepared and mounted in organ baths to record isometric tension changes. The contractile effects of D-1997 in the basilar artery were compared with those produced by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and the 5-HT receptor agonist quipazine. Thus, 4-HT (10(-10)-10(-6)M), D-1997 (3.1 x 10(-8)-10(-4) M) and quipazine (3.1 x 10(-7)-10(-4) M) each caused concentration-dependent contractions of the canine basilar artery with a rank order of agonist potency of 5-HT > D-1997 > quipazine. 5-HT and D-1997 exhibited similar maximum effects which were higher than that of quipazine. Similar concentrations of D-1997 failed to produce contraction in rat aorta. The effects of D-1997 in the basilar artery were not modified by incubation with either the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist ketanserin (0.01-1 microM), the 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptor antagonist ICS205930 (tropisetron; 0.1-10 microM), the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist spiroxatrine (0.01-1 microM), the beta-adrenoceptor blocker with high affinity for 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B binding sites (+/-)-pindolol (0.01-1 microM), or the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (0.01-1 microM). In contrast, the D-1997-induced responses were potently and concentration-dependently antagonized by the mixed 5-HT1-like and 5-HT2 receptor antagonist methiothepin (0.01-1 microM). It is concluded that D-1997 contracts the canine basilar artery by stimulating 5-HT1-like receptors unrelated to either the 5-HT1A or 5-HT1B receptor subtypes. The compound seems to be devoid of 5-HT2 receptor agonist properties in rat aorta.
22410778	Oncogenic K-ras expression is associated with derangement of the cAMP/PKA pathway and forskolin-reversible alterations of mitochondrial dynamics and respiration.	The Warburg effect in cancer cells has been proposed to involve several mechanisms, including adaptation to hypoxia, oncogenes activation or loss of oncosuppressors and impaired mitochondrial function. In previous papers, it has been shown that K-ras transformed mouse cells are much more sensitive as compared with normal cells to glucose withdrawal (undergoing apoptosis) and present a high glycolytic rate and a strong reduction of mitochondrial complex I. Recent observations suggest that transformed cells have a derangement in the cyclic adenosine monophosphate/cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAMP/PKA) pathway, which is known to regulate several mitochondrial functions. Herein, the derangement of the cAMP/PKA pathway and its impact on transformation-linked changes of mitochondrial functions is investigated. Exogenous stimulation of PKA activity, achieved by forskolin treatment, protected K-ras-transformed cells from apoptosis induced by glucose deprivation, enhanced complex I activity, intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, mitochondrial fusion and decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Several of these effects were almost completely prevented by inhibiting the PKA activity. Short-time treatment with compounds favoring mitochondrial fusion strongly decreased the cellular ROS levels especially in transformed cells. These findings support the notion that glucose shortage-induced apoptosis, specific of K-ras-transformed cells, is associated to a derangement of PKA signaling that leads to mitochondrial complex I decrease, reduction of ATP formation, prevalence of mitochondrial fission over fusion, and thereby opening new approaches for development of anticancer drugs.
9525919	Identification of binding sites for bepridil and trifluoperazine on cardiac troponin C.	The solution structure of cardiac troponin C (cTnC) (Sia, S., Li, M. X., Spyracopoulos, L., Gagne, S. M., Liu, W., Putkey, J. A. & Sykes, B. D. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 18216-18221) challenges existing structure/function models for this critical regulatory protein. For example, it is clear that the closed conformation of the regulatory N-terminal domain in Ca2+-bound cardiac troponin C (cTnC) presents a much different binding surface for Ca2+-sensitizing compounds than previously thought. We report here the use of Met methyl groups as site-specific structural markers to identify drug binding sites for trifluoperazine and bepridil on cTnC. Drug dependent changes in the NMR heteronuclear single-quantum coherence spectra of [methyl-13C]Met-labeled cTnC indicate that bepridil and trifluoperazine bind to similar sites but only in the presence of Ca2+. There are 3-4 drug binding sites in the N- and C-terminal domains of intact cTnC that exhibit fast exchange on the NMR time scale. Use of a novel spin-labeled phenothiazine and detection of isotope-filtered nuclear Overhauser effects allowed identification of drug binding sites in the shallow hydrophobic cup in the C-terminal domain and on two hydrophobic surfaces on the N-terminal regulatory domain. The data presented here, coupled with our previous study using covalent blocking groups, support a model in which the Ca2+-sensitizing binding site includes Met-45 in helix B of site I, and Met-60 and -80 in helices B and C of the regulatory site II. This subregion in cTnC makes a likely target against which to design new and selective Ca2+-sensitizing compounds.
22658648	Chronic treatment with myo-inositol reduces white adipose tissue accretion and improves insulin sensitivity in female mice.	Type 2 diabetes is a complex disease characterized by a state of insulin resistance in peripheral tissues such as skeletal muscle, adipose tissue or liver. Some inositol isomers have been reported to possess insulin-mimetic activity and to be efficient in lowering blood glucose level. The aim of the present study was to assess in mice the metabolic effects of a chronic treatment with myo-inositol, the most common stereoisomer of inositol. Mice given myo-inositol treatment (0.9 or 1.2 mg g(-1) day(-1), 15 days, orally or intraperitoneally) exhibited an improved glucose tolerance due to a greater insulin sensitivity. Mice treated with myo-inositol exhibited a decreased white adipose tissue accretion (-33%, P<.005) compared with controls. The decrease in white adipose tissue deposition was due to a decrease in adipose cell volume (-33%, P<.05), while no change was noticed in total adipocyte number. In skeletal muscle, in vivo as well as ex vivo myo-inositol treatment increased protein kinase B/Akt phosphorylation under baseline and insulin-stimulated conditions, suggesting a synergistic action of myo-inositol treatment and insulin on proteins of the insulin signalling pathway. Myo-inositol could therefore constitute a viable nutritional strategy for the prevention and/or treatment of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.
10208549	Effects of bis(7)-tacrine, a novel anti-Alzheimer's agent, on rat brain AChE.	The anticholinesterase effects of bis(7)-tacrine were compared with tacrine in vitro and in vivo. Based on IC50 ratios, the dimeric analog bis(7)-tacrine was, in a reversible manner, up to 150-fold more potent and 250-fold more selective than tacrine for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) over butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Following a single oral administration, both bis(7)-tacrine and tacrine produced dose-dependent inhibitions of AChE in rat brain, but bis(7)-tacrine exhibited higher efficacy and AChE/BChE selectivity than tacrine. The anti-AChE efficacy of bis(7)-tacrine was quite similar following an oral or i.p. administration, but tacrine showed much lower efficacy when administered orally than when given i.p. These findings suggest bis(7)-tacrine, a highly potent and selective inhibitor of AChE, can probably be used as an improved drug in the palliative treatment of AD.
7476290	Erythrocyte insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I receptor tyrosine kinase activity in hypertension in pregnancy.	We have shown that preeclampsia is associated with insulin resistance. In the present study, we examined young normal, preeclamptic (PE), and gestational hypertensive (GH) nulliparous African-American women at term to investigate cellular determinants of this resistance and insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) binding to partially purified erythrocyte receptors and receptor tyrosine kinase activity (TKA). Blood pressure was significantly elevated in PE and GH subjects as compared with controls. Insulin binding was similar in number and affinity in the three groups (femtomoles per microgram). IGF-I binding was increased in PE subjects as compared with either normals or GH subjects (0.2 +/- 0.02, 0.15 +/- 0.01, and 0.14 +/- 0.02 fmol/microgram protein). Insulin receptor TKA was increased in PE subjects as compared with normals when assessed either per microgram protein or per femtomole insulin binding (P < .01). In contrast, IGF-I-potentiated TKA was elevated in PE subjects only when assessed per microgram protein (P < .03). Thus, the increased number of IGF-I receptors in erythrocytes of PE subjects yields a net increase in receptor tyrosine kinase. Also, there is an augmentation of insulin receptor TKA in PE subjects. Together, these two alterations may be a compensatory mechanism for the insulin resistance associated with hypertensive diseases of pregnancy.
20426763	Serotonin-2 receptor agonists as novel ocular hypotensive agents and their cellular and molecular mechanisms of action.	The eye is innervated by numerous serotonergic nerves and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5HT) is present in the aqueous humor of animal and human eyes. In an effort to delineate the role of the serotonergic system in modulating intraocular pressure (IOP) within the anterior segment of the eye, extensive topical ocular dosing studies were conducted with a variety of 5HT ligands and in various animal species. Even though certain 5HT(1A) agonists decreased IOP in rabbits, these compounds failed to affect IOP in normotensive or ocular hypertensive monkey eyes. In contrast, while 5HT(2) agonists induced significant IOP reductions in normotensive rat eyes and in eyes of ocular hypertensive Cynomolgus monkeys, these agents were inactive in ocular normotensive cats and rabbits. Additional studies indicated a strong involvement of 5HT(2A) receptors in mediating IOP-lowering in conscious ocular hypertensive Cynomolgus monkeys. As a result of further structure-activity investigations, AL-34662, a selective 5HT(2) agonist (relative to other 5HT receptor types and sub-types) with high affinity, potency and efficacy at 5HT(2A), 5HT(2B) and 5HT(2C) receptors was discovered that efficaciously lowered IOP in the monkey model of ocular hypertension (33 +/- 3 % reduction out to 6 hrs post with a 300 microg topical ocular dose). Due to unavailability of monkey ocular cells, extensive in vitro studies were conducted using relevant human ocular cells in order to correlate with and support the in vivo observations in the monkeys. RT-PCR and in situ hybridization studies revealed the presence of mRNAs for 5HT(2A-C) receptor subtypes in human ocular tissues involved in IOP modulation. The relative distribution and density of these mRNAs were as follows: ciliary body (CB) (5HT(2A) > 5HT(2B) > 5HT(2C)), ciliary epithelium (CE) (5HT(2A) > 5HT(2B) = 5HT(2C)) and trabecular meshwork (TM) (5HT(2A)= 5HT(2B) >> 5HT(2C)). Furthermore, quantitative autoradiography revealed a relatively high specific binding of [(3)H]-5HT and [(3)H]-ketanserin to 5HT(2) receptors in human CE and longitudinal ciliary muscle (CM). Second messenger studies revealed the presence of phospholipase C-coupled 5HT(2A) receptors in h-CM and h-TM cells where they stimulated phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis and mobilized intracellular Ca(2+) when challenged with a variety of 5HT(2A-C) receptor agonists (e.g. alpha-methyl-5HT, (R)-DOI, alpha-methyl-5HT, BW-723C86, MK-212, mCPP, cabergoline, AL-34662). These functional responses were blocked by selective 5HT(2) receptor antagonists with the 5HT(2A) antagonist, M-100970, exhibiting the highest potency. Thus, functional 5HT(2A) receptors are present in human ocular cells involved in IOP reduction and this correlates with the ability of 5HT(2A) agonists to lower IOP in Cynomolgus monkeys, a surrogate for human subjects.
17325667	A novel tyrosine kinase switch is a mechanism of imatinib resistance in gastrointestinal stromal tumors.	KIT or alpha-platelet-derived growth factor receptor (alpha-PDGFR) activating mutations are the pathogenic mechanisms that characterize gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). Despite excellent responses to imatinib mesylate (IM), patients are relapsing. We developed an IM-resistant GIST cell line (GIST-R) from the IM-sensitive GIST882 cell line (GIST-S) by growing these cells in IM. Gene expression profiling (GEP) of GIST-S, GIST-R cells and two IM resistant GIST patients demonstrated that KIT is downregulated implying a major role in IM resistance. Instead, GIST-R cells have acquired IM resistance by overexpressing the oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase - AXL - in a 'kinase switch'. Further, the two IM resistant GIST patients express AXL and not c-Kit, seen by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting of the GIST-S and GIST-R cells confirmed the switch from Kit to AXL. In GIST-R, AXL is tyrosine phosphorylated and its ligand growth-arrest-specific gene 6 is overexpressed implying autocrine activation. The kinase switch is associated with a morphological change from spindle to epithelioid. Molecular modeling of the kinase domain of mutant c-Kit (V654A) and AXL showed no binding to IM but efficient binding to MP470, a novel c-Kit/AXL kinase inhibitor. MP470 synergizes with docetaxel (taxotere) and is cytotoxic to GIST cells.
9662053	Organization of the human carboxypeptidase E gene and molecular scanning for mutations in Japanese subjects with NIDDM or obesity.	Insulin is synthesized in the pancreatic beta cell as a larger precursor molecule proinsulin which is converted to insulin and C-peptide by the concerted action of prohormone convertase 2 (PC2), prohormone convertase 3 (PC3) and carboxypeptidase E (CPE). One of the features of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is an elevation in the proinsulin level and/or proinsulin/insulin molar ratio suggesting that mutations in these three proinsulin processing enzymes might contribute to the development of NIDDM. The identification of a mutation in the CPE gene of the fat/fat mouse which leads to marked hyperproinsulinaemia and late-onset obesity and diabetes is consistent with a possible role for mutations in CPE in the development of diabetes and obesity in humans. In order to test this hypothesis, we have isolated and characterized the human CPE gene and screened it for mutations in a group of Japanese subjects with NIDDM and obesity. The human CPE gene consists of 9 exons spanning more than 60 kb. Primer extension analysis identified the transcriptional start site at -141 bp from the translational start site. Single strand conformational polymorphism analysis and nucleotide sequencing of the promoter and entire coding region of the CPE gene in 269 Japanese subjects with NIDDM, 28 nondiabetic obese subjects and 104 nonobese and nondiabetic controls revealed three nucleotide changes, a G-to-T substitution at nucleotide -53, a G-to-A substitution at nucleotide -144 (relative to start of transcription) in the promoter region and a silent G-to-A substitution in codon 219. None of the nucleotide substitutions were associated with NIDDM or obesity. Thus, genetic variation in the CPE gene does not appear to play a major role in the pathogenesis of NIDDM or obesity in Japanese subjects.
11103886	Neuropsychological and conditioned blocking performance in patients with schizophrenia: assessment of the contribution of neuroleptic dose, serum levels and dopamine D2-receptor occupancy.	Patients with schizophrenia show impairments of attention and neuropsychological performance, but the extent to which this is attributable to antipsychotic medication remains largely unexplored. We describe here the putative influence of the dose of antipsychotic medication (chlorpromazine equivalents, CPZ), the antipsychotic serum concentration of dopamine (DA) D2-blocking activity and the approximated central dopamine D2-receptor occupancy (DA D2-occupancy), on conditioned blocking (CB) measures of attention and performance on a neuropsychological battery, in 108 patients with schizophrenia (compared with 62 healthy controls). Antipsychotic serum concentration and D2-occupancy were higher in patients with a paranoid versus non-paranoid diagnosis, and in female versus male patients (independent of symptom severity). Controlling for D2-occupancy removed the difference between high CB in paranoid and impaired low CB in non-paranoid patients. Similar partial correlations for antipsychotic drug dose and serum levels of DA D2-blocking activity with performance of the trail-making and picture completion tests (negative) and the block-design task (positive) showed the functional importance of DA-related activity. High estimates of central DA D2-occupancy were related to impaired verbal fluency but were associated with improved recall of stories, especially in paranoid patients. This, the first study of its kind, tentatively imputes a role for DA D2-related activity in left frontal (e.g. CB, verbal fluency) and temporal lobe functions (verbal recall) as well as in some non-verbal abilities mediated more in the right hemisphere in patients with schizophrenia.
16316409	A novel function of differentiation revealed by cDNA microarray profiling of p75NTR-regulated gene expression.	The expression of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) is diminished in epithelial cells during progression of prostate cancer in vivo and in vitro. Previous studies have demonstrated a role for p75NTR as a tumor suppressor in prostate growth. To better understand the molecular mechanism of p75(NTR) on tumor suppression, we utilized a complementary deoxyribonucleic acid microarray composed of approximately 6,000 human cancer-related genes to determine the gene expression pattern altered by re-introduction of p75NTR into PC-3 prostate tumor cells. Comparison of the transcripts in the neo and p75NTR-transfected cells revealed 52 differentially expressed genes, of which 21 were up-regulated and 31 were down-regulated in the presence of p75NTR. Based on the known biological functions of the p75NTR-regulated genes, we observed that p75NTR modulated the expression of genes that are critically involved in the regulation of differentiation as well as cell adhesion, signal transduction, apoptosis, tumor cell invasion, and metastasis. Several differentially expressed genes identified by microarray were selected for confirmation using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Immunoblot analysis further confirmed increased cellular retinoic acid-binding protein I (CRABPI) and IGFBP5 protein levels and decreased level of PLAUR protein with increasing p75NTR protein expression. As CRABPI was elevated far more than any other genes, we observed that the retinoids, all-trans retinoic acid and 9-cis retinoic acid, that bind CRABPI, promoted nitroblue tetrazolium-associated functional cell differentiation in p75NTR PC-3 cells, but not in neo control PC-3 cells. Subsequent examination of the retinoic acid receptors (RARs) expression levels demonstrated an absence of RAR-beta in the neo control cells and re-expression in the p75NTR expressing cells, consistent with previous findings where RAR-beta is believed to play a critical role as a tumor suppressor gene that is lost during de-differentiation of prostate epithelial cells. Whereas the RAR-alpha and -gamma protein levels remained unchanged, retinoid X receptor (RXR)-alpha and -beta also exhibited increasing protein levels with re-expression of the p75NTR protein. Moreover, the ability of p75NTR siRNA to knockdown levels of RAR-beta, RXR-alpha, and RXR-beta supports the specificity of the functional involvement of p75NTR in differentiation. Hence, re-expression of the p75NTR appears to partially reverse de-differentiation of prostate cancer cells by up-regulating the expression of CRABPI for localized sequestration of retinoids that are available to newly up-regulated RAR-beta, RXR-alpha, and RXR-beta.
14741265	Manipulation of kinetic profiles in 2-aryl propionic acid cyclooxygenase inhibitors.	The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs flurbiprofen and ibuprofen were modified in an attempt to alter the kinetics of inhibitor binding by COX-1. Contrary to prior predictions, a halogen substituent is not sufficient to confer slow tight-binding behavior. Conversion of the carboxylate moiety of flurbiprofen to an ester or amide abolishes slow tight-binding behavior, regardless of halogenation state.
23293126	Effects of smoking on the oxidant/antioxidant balance and the blood lipids in pesticide sprayers.	The present study was conducted on 80 pesticide male sprayers (42 nonsmokers and 38 smokers). Our aim was to estimate the smoking effects on blood lipids and oxidant/antioxidant status in pesticide sprayers. Results revealed that cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and glutathion peroxidase (GPx) enzyme were significantly higher in the 38 smoker sprayers than in the 42 nonsmoker sprayers. Cholesterol and LDL were correlated with smoking index and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme and zinc (Zn) were inversely correlated with duration of pesticides' exposure. In nonsmokers, LDL and cholesterol were negatively correlated with SOD and correlated with malondialdehyde (MDA), and cholesterol was negatively correlated with Zn. HDL was negatively correlated with MDA in all the sprayers, but was correlated with GPx in smokers and with Zn in nonsmokers. In smokers, LDL was negatively correlated with GPx, HDL was negatively correlated with MDA and triglycerides and very-low-density lipoprotein were negatively correlated with Zn. MDA was negatively correlated with SOD, GPx and Zn. Smoking and pesticide exposure could be responsible for hyperlipidemia and oxidative stress. Therefore, improvement in the antioxidant status is mandatory for pesticide sprayers especially the ones who smoke.
18393142	Current and future prospects for anticoagulant therapy: inhibitors of factor Xa and factor IIa.	Indirect systemic and direct oral factor Xa and direct oral factor IIa inhibitors with improved pharmacologic profiles compared with heparins and vitamin K antagonists are currently in clinical development. This overview focuses on the indirect antithrombin dependent pentasaccharide derivatives of idraparinux and on the most advanced oral direct inhibitors to factor Xa (rivaroxaban and apixaban) and IIa (dabigatran). Specifically, the results of dose-finding studies for the prevention of venous thromboembolism after elective orthopedic surgery, the results of dose-finding studies for treatment of acute venous thromboembolism including prolonged prophylaxis of recurrent events, and the designs of ongoing clinical trials are reviewed.
10229502	Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor of the CNS: cytopathology and immunohistochemistry of insulin-like growth factor-II, insulin-like growth factor receptor type 1, cathepsin D, and Ki-67.	Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-II is a potent growth factor, normally controlled by a number of other factors, including IGF binding proteins and IGF binding protein proteases. In general, the latter increase the bioavailability of IGF by cleaving IGF binding proteins. Cathepsin D (an IGF binding protein protease) was also implicated in tumor invasion. Although IGF-II was implicated in the pathogeneses of various childhood neoplasms, its significance in the pathogenesis of atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor of the central nervous system (ATRT-CNS) was not studied to date. We present clinicopathologic features of two cases of ATRT-CNS. In addition, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were stained immunohistochemically for IGF-II, IGF receptor type 1, cathepsin D, and Ki-67. Both tumors demonstrated diffuse strong cytoplasmic positivity for IGF-II, diffuse cytoplasmic and focal membranous positivity for IGF receptor type I, and diffuse cytoplasmic positivity for cathepsin D. The Ki-67 labeling indices were 10.0% and 1.4%. We conclude that ATRT-CNS cells express both IGF-II and IGF receptor type 1, supporting the hypothesis that autocrine/paracrine stimulation of cell growth by IGF-II might be one mechanism involved in ATRT-CNS tumorigenesis. Cathepsin D expressed by the tumor cells might also be involved in both tumor cell invasion and growth. The exact pathogenesis of ATRT-CNS remains to be elucidated.
23287056	Synthesis and biological evaluation of new N-alkylcarbazole derivatives as STAT3 inhibitors: preliminary study.	The signalling pathway of Janus tyrosine Kinases-Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (JAK-STAT) is activated by a number of cytokines, hormones (GH, erythropoietin and prolactin), and growth factors. JAK-STAT signalling is involved in regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. These activities are due to different members of JAK-STAT family consisting of: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, Tyk2 and STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5a, STAT5b, STAT6. Recent studies suggest a key role for STAT family proteins, in particular for STAT3, in selectively inducing and maintaining a pro-carcinogenic inflammatory microenvironment, that promote tumour cells transformation. Moreover, a striking correlation between cancer development/progression and STAT3 persistent activation exists, probably due to STAT3 promoting of the pro-oncogenic inflammatory pathways, like NF-kB, IL-6 and JAK family kinases. Recent study demonstrated that carbazoles can inhibit STAT3 mediated transcription. From these evidences, STAT3 represents a therapeutic target, so we have synthesized a new set of N-alkylcarbazole derivatives substituted in positions 2, 4 and 6, to evaluate their activity on STAT3. Some of these compounds showed an interesting activity as STAT3 selective inhibitors; in particular, compounds 9a 9b and 9c revealed to inhibit the STAT3 activation for the 50%, 90% and 95%, respectively.
9622938	[A new inherited metabolic disease: delta1-pyrroline 5-carboxylate synthetase deficiency].	delta 1-pyrroline 5-carboxylate synthetase (P5C synthetase) catalyzes the ATP and the NAD(P)H-dependent conversion of L-glutamate to glutamate semialdehyde (GSA) which is the metabolic precursor for proline biosynthesis. We described in two siblings a paradoxical hyperammonemia with hypoprolinemia and hypoornithinemia associated to bilateral cataract, mental retardation, joint laxity and skin hyperelasticity. We cloned human P5C synthetase-cDNA by database cloning strategy: this cDNA has an open reading frame of 2,385 bases coding for a polypeptide of 795 amino acids. Both patients are homozygous for an L396S substitution, this amino acid being highly conserved across species. This is the first report of a P5C synthetase deficiency in human.
7499320	How do volatile anesthetics inhibit Ca(2+)-ATPases?	Volatile anesthetics at concentrations that are used in clinical practice to induce anesthesia selectively inhibit activity of the plasma membrane Ca(2+)-transport ATPase (Kosk-Kosicka, D., and Roszczynska, G. (1993) Anesthesiology 79, 774-780). We have investigated the mechanism of the inhibitory action of several anesthetics on the purified erythrocyte Ca(2+)-ATPase by employing fluorescence spectroscopy measurements that report changes in the environment of intrinsic tryptophans and of an extrinsic probe attached in the active site of the enzyme. We have shown that the observed inhibition of the Ca(2+)-dependent activation of the enzyme correlates well with the elimination of the Ca(2+)-induced conformation change that is important for the proper function of the enzyme. Analysis of the anesthetics effects on the total tryptophan fluorescence indicates a significant effect on enzyme conformation. Similar changes have been observed in the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase. We propose that volatile anesthetics inhibit Ca(2+)-ATPase by interacting with nonpolar sites in protein interior, in analogy to the binding demonstrated for myoglobin, hemoglobin, and adenylate kinase (Schoenborn, B. P., and Featherstone, R. M. (1967) Adv. Pharmacol. 5, 1-17; Tilton, R. F., Kuntz, I. D., and Petsko, G. A. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 2849-2857). Such binding is expected to modify conformational substate(s) of the enzyme and perturb its function. We view this process as an example of a general phenomena of interaction of small molecules with internal sites in proteins.
23339625	Time-dependent changes in hepatic and intestinal induction of cytochrome P450 3A after administration of dexamethasone to rats.	Abstract 1. We investigated the effects of the dose of and the number of times an inducer was administered and the duration of induction of hepatic and intestinal cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) in rats using dexamethasone 21-phosphate (DEX-P) and midazolam (MDZ) as an inducer and a substrate to CYP3A, respectively. 2. The number of times DEX-P was administered was not a significant factor in the induction of either hepatic or intestinal CYP3A; however, administration of DEX-P multiple times markedly decreased the bioavailability of DEX-P by self-induction of CYP3A. 3. CYP3A induction in the liver increased depending on the dose of DEX-P, whereas that in intestine showed a mild increase, but the induction level was almost constant regardless of the dose of DEX-P. 4. Administration of a single dose of DEX-P showed a temporal increase in CYP3A activity in both tissues and the induction ratios reached maximum values at 12 h after DEX-P administration. On the other hand, a mild increase of CYP3A activity, which lasted for at least 48 h, was observed in both tissues after administration of multiple doses. 5. Some physiological compounds such as cytokines might be involved in decreasing the CYP3A activity to maintain homeostasis of the body.
23590386	Fibrillar Morphology of Derivatives of Poly(3-alkylthiophene)s by Solvent Vapor Annealing: Effects of Conformational Transition and Conjugate Length.	A fibrillar morphology was obtained, compared to the featherless pristine films, via solvent annealing the films of a series of derivatives of poly(3-alkylthiophene)s (P3ATs): poly(3-dodecylthiophene) (P3DDT), poly(3,3‴-didodecyl-quaterthiophene) (PQT12), and poly(2,5-bis(3-dodecylthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene) (pBTTT12). Among the solvents used, including dichloromethane, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, and carbon disulfide (CS2), CS2 was the best to induce fibril formation because its solubility parameter is closest to those of the P3AT derivatives. It was found that higher critical CS2 vapor pressures were needed to form crystal nuclei with increasing conjugation length and molecular weight of the P3AT derivatives; i.e., the critical vapor pressures for P3DDT 13.9k and PQT12 15.5k were 59.0% and 80.7%, respectively, and there were no nuclei of fibrils for pBTTT12 15.6k with the highest conjugation length, even at a CS2 vapor pressure of 98.3%. Meanwhile, at the highest vapor pressure, the fibril density decreased with increasing conjugation length and molecular weight of the P3AT derivatives. This is attributed to the rod-like conformation prevailing for polymers with larger conjugation length and higher molecular weight during solvent annealing, making the conformational transition toward coils more difficult and hindering diffusion of molecules. The results presented here are expected to be helpful for the design and processing of conjugated semiconductor polymers.
9990413	Pharmacology of adapalene.	Adapalene, a synthetic retinoid, is a new drug proposed for the treatment of acne patients. Studies on the in vitro and in vivo pharmacology of adapalene have shown that it is very active on cell and tissue proliferation and differentiation. Furthermore, adapalene has anti-inflammatory potential as determined by its anti-AP1 activity. Adapalene interacts selectively with the nuclear receptors RAR beta and RAR gamma, and its activity on proliferation and differentiation can be blocked by a RAR beta-gamma antagonist. Because RAR beta is not expressed in human keratinocytes, the effect of adapalene on the major cell type of the epidermis is certainly mediated by its interaction with RAR gamma. The unique pharmacological properties of adapalene may explain why, when compared to tretinoin, it has an improved therapeutic ratio due to its better tolerance.
23393209	Determinants of Maternal Triglycerides in Women With Gestational Diabetes Mellitus in the Metformin in Gestational Diabetes (MiG) Study.	OBJECTIVEFactors associated with increasing maternal triglyceride concentrations in late pregnancy include gestational age, obesity, preeclampsia, and altered glucose metabolism. In a subgroup of women in the Metformin in Gestational Diabetes (MiG) trial, maternal plasma triglycerides increased more between enrollment (30 weeks) and 36 weeks in those treated with metformin compared with insulin. The aim of this study was to explain this finding by examining factors potentially related to triglycerides in these women.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSOf the 733 women randomized to metformin or insulin in the MiG trial, 432 (219 metformin and 213 insulin) had fasting plasma triglycerides measured at enrollment and at 36 weeks. Factors associated with maternal triglycerides were assessed using general linear modeling.RESULTSMean plasma triglyceride concentrations were 2.43 (95% CI 2.35-2.51) mmol/L at enrollment. Triglycerides were higher at 36 weeks in women randomized to metformin (2.94 [2.80-3.08] mmol/L; +23.13% [18.72-27.53%]) than insulin (2.65 [2.54-2.77] mmol/L, P = 0.002; +14.36% [10.91-17.82%], P = 0.002). At 36 weeks, triglycerides were associated with HbA1c (P = 0.03), ethnicity (P = 0.001), and treatment allocation (P = 0.005). In insulin-treated women, 36-week triglycerides were associated with 36-week HbA1c (P = 0.02), and in metformin-treated women, they were related to ethnicity.CONCLUSIONSAt 36 weeks, maternal triglycerides were related to glucose control in women treated with insulin and ethnicity in women treated with metformin. Whether there are ethnicity-related dietary changes or differences in metformin response that alter the relationship between glucose control and triglycerides requires further study.
23508685	Repressive Epigenetic Changes at the Mglu2 Promoter in Frontal Cortex of 5-HT2A Knockout Mice.	Serotonin 5-HT2A and metabotropic glutamate 2 (mGlu2) are G protein-coupled receptors suspected in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, depression and suicide. Previous findings demonstrate that mGlu2 mRNA expression is down-regulated in brain cortical regions of 5-HT2A knockout (KO) mice. However, the molecular mechanism responsible for this alteration remains unknown. We show here repressive epigenetic changes at the promoter region of the mGlu2 gene in frontal cortex of 5-HT2A-KO mice. Disruption of 5-HT2A receptor-dependent signaling in mice was associated with decreased acetylation of histone H3 (H3ac) and H4 (H4ac), and increased tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) at the mGlu2 promoter-epigenetic changes that correlate with transcriptional repression. Neither methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me1/2/3) nor tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me3) was affected. We found that Egr1, a transcription factor whose promoter activity was positively regulated by the 5-HT2A receptor agonist TCB-2, binds less to the mGlu2 promoter in frontal cortex of 5-HT2A-KO as compared to wild-type mice. Furthermore, expression of mGlu2 was increased by viral-mediated gene transfer of Flag-tagged Egr1 in mouse frontal cortex. Together, these observations suggest that 5-HT2A receptor-dependent signaling epigenetically affects mGlu2 transcription in mouse frontal cortex.
23454655	Human exposure to mycotoxins and their masked forms through cereal-based foods in Belgium.	In the present study, a quantitative dietary exposure assessment of mycotoxins and their masked forms was conducted on a national representative sample of the Belgian population using the contamination data of cereal-based foods. Cereal-based food products (n=174) were analysed for the occurrence of deoxynivalenol, 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol, 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol, zearalenone, α-zearalenol, β-zearalenol, T-2-toxin, HT-2-toxin, and their respective masked forms, including, deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside, zearalenone-4-glucoside, α-zearalenol-4-glucoside, β-zearalenol-4-glucoside and zearalenone-4-sulfate. Fibre-enriched bread, bran-enriched bread, breakfast cereals, popcorn and oatmeal were collected in Belgian supermarkets according to a structured sampling plan and analysed during the period from April 2010 to October 2011. The habitual intake of these food groups was estimated from a national representative food intake survey. According to a probabilistic exposure analysis, the mean (and P95) mycotoxin intake for the sum of the deoxynivalenol-equivalents, zearalenone-equivalents, and the sum of HT-2-and T-2-toxin for all cereal-based foods was 0.1162 (0.4047, P95), 0.0447 (0.1568, P95) and 0.0258 (0.0924, P95) μg kg(-1)body weight day(-1), respectively. These values were below the tolerable daily intake (TDI) levels for deoxynivalenol, zearalenone and the sum of T-2 and HT-2 toxin (1.0, 0.25 and 0.1 μg kg(-1)body weight day(-1), respectively). The absolute level exceeding the TDI for all cereal-based foods was calculated, and recorded 0.85%, 2.75% and 4.11% of the Belgian population, respectively.
17611697	RARalpha is a regulatory factor for Am-80-induced cell growth inhibition of hematologic malignant cells.	Retinoids are used for treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Am-80, Tamibarotene, binds to retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) more specifically than all-trans retinoic acid. We studied the tumor cell suppressive effects of Am-80, with respect to cytotoxicity and growth inhibition using eight myeloid and lymphoid malignant cells in culture (HL-60, HL-60R, K-562, Kasumi-1, MEG01, Raji, U266B1, and U937). The effects of Am-80 were examined during 9 days of incubation with 10(-7)-10(-5) M of Am-80 in culture medium, which was changed every 3 days. HL-60 were the only cells sensitive to Am-80-induced cytotoxicity; the latter reached more than 95% after 9 days of incubation, and death was primarily through apoptosis. The total mass of RARalpha in HL-60 was significantly greater (p<0.006) than in ATRA-resistant HL-60 (HL-60R) as well as all of other cells tested. However, in all cells excluding HL-60, Am-80 induced time- and dose-dependent cell growth inhibition without noticeable cytotoxicity. TGF-beta2 was released into the media containing cells incubated with Am-80 for 3 days. A dose-dependent increment of phosphorylation of Smad-2 was also detected. The relative amount of secreted TGF-beta2 correlated with the growth inhibition rates in all cells tested excluding HL-60, and with the total mass of RARalpha in the cells (p=0.0137). Our results indicate that Am-80-induced cell-type non-specific growth inhibition is mediated by TGF-beta2, where the total mass of RARalpha could be an important regulatory factor in hematologic malignant cells.
23393220	Pharmacokinetic Interactions between Monoamine Oxidase A Inhibitor Harmaline and 5-Methoxy-N,N-Dimethyltryptamine, and the Impact of CYP2D6 Status.	"5-Methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT or street name ""5-MEO"") is a newer designer drug belonging to a group of naturally occurring indolealkylamines. Our recent study has demonstrated that coadministration of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) inhibitor harmaline (5 mg/kg) increases systemic exposure to 5-MeO-DMT (2 mg/kg) and active metabolite bufotenine. This study is aimed at delineating harmaline and 5-MeO-DMT pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions at multiple dose levels, as well as the impact of CYP2D6 that affects harmaline PK and determines 5-MeO-DMT O-demethylation to produce bufotenine. Our data revealed that inhibition of MAO-A-mediated metabolic elimination by harmaline (2, 5, and 15 mg/kg) led to a sharp increase in systemic and cerebral exposure to 5-MeO-DMT (2 and 10 mg/kg) at all dose combinations. A more pronounced effect on 5-MeO-DMT PK was associated with greater exposure to harmaline in wild-type mice than CYP2D6-humanized (Tg-CYP2D6) mice. Harmaline (5 mg/kg) also increased blood and brain bufotenine concentrations that were generally higher in Tg-CYP2D6 mice. Surprisingly, greater harmaline dose (15 mg/kg) reduced bufotenine levels. The in vivo inhibitory effect of harmaline on CYP2D6-catalyzed bufotenine formation was confirmed by in vitro study using purified CYP2D6. Given these findings, a unified PK model including the inhibition of MAO-A- and CYP2D6-catalyzed 5-MeO-DMT metabolism by harmaline was developed to describe blood harmaline, 5-MeO-DMT, and bufotenine PK profiles in both wild-type and Tg-CYP2D6 mouse models. This PK model may be further employed to predict harmaline and 5-MeO-DMT PK interactions at various doses, define the impact of CYP2D6 status, and drive harmaline-5-MeO-DMT pharmacodynamics."
10653606	24R,25-(OH)(2)D(3) mediates its membrane receptor-dependent effects on protein kinase C and alkaline phosphatase via phospholipase A(2) and cyclooxygenase-1 but not cyclooxygenase-2 in growth plate chondrocytes.	Recent studies have shown that 24R,25-(OH)(2)D(3) mediates its effects on growth plate chondrocytes via membrane receptors. This study examined the roles of phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) and cyclooxygenase (Cox) in the mechanism of action of 24R, 25-(OH)(2)D(3) in resting zone chondrocytes in order to determine whether the activity of one or both enzymes provides a regulatory checkpoint in the signaling pathway resulting in increased protein kinase C (PKC) activity. We also determined whether constitutive or inducible Cox is involved. Cultures were incubated with 24R, 25-(OH)(2)D(3) for 90 min to measure PKC or for 24 h to measure physiological responses ([(3)H]-thymidine incorporation, alkaline phosphatase-specific activity, [(35)S]-sulfate incorporation). Based on RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis, resting zone chondrocytes express mRNAs for both Cox-1 and Cox-2. Levels of mRNA for both proteins were unchanged from control levels after a 24-h incubation with 24R,25-(OH)(2)D(3). To examine the role of Cox, the cultures were also treated with resveratrol (a specific inhibitor of Cox-1), NS-398 (a specific inhibitor of Cox-2), or indomethacin (a general Cox inhibitor). Cox-1 inhibition resulted in effects on proliferation, differentiation, and matrix production typical of 24R, 25-(OH)(2)D(3). In contrast, inhibition of Cox-2 had no effect, indicating that 24R,25-(OH)(2)D(3) exerts its effects via Cox-1. Inhibition of Cox-1 also blocked 24R,25-(OH)(2)D(3)-dependent increases in PKC. Activation of PLA(2) with melittin inhibited 24R, 25-(OH)(2)D(3)-dependent stimulation of PKC, and inhibition of PLA(2) with quinacrine stimulated PKC in response to 24R, 25-(OH)(2)D(3). Inclusion of resveratrol reduced the melittin-dependent inhibition of PLA(2) and caused an increase in quinacrine-stimulated PLA(2) activity. Metabolism of arachidonic acid to leukotrienes is not involved in the response to 24R, 25-(OH)(2)D(3) because inhibition of lipoxygenase had no effect. The effect of 24R,25-(OH)(2)D(3) was specific because 24S,25-(OH)(2)D(3), the biologically inactive stereoisomer, failed to elicit a response from the cells. These results support the hypothesis that 24R, 25-(OH)(2)D(3) exerts its effects via more than one signaling pathway and that these pathways are interrelated via the modulation of PLA(2). PKC regulation may occur at multiple stages in the signal transduction cascade.
15044619	Glutathione S-transferase M1 and multidrug resistance protein 1 act in synergy to protect melanoma cells from vincristine effects.	Previous studies have shown that glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) can operate in synergy with efflux transporters, multi-drug resistance proteins (MRPs), to confer resistance to several carcinogens, mutagens and anticancer drugs. To address the poorly documented role of the GSTM1 in cancer chemoresistance, we used CAL1 human melanoma cells expressing no endogenous GSTM1 and a high level of MRP1. Cells were transfected with an expression vector containing the GSTM1 cDNA, and different clones were selected expressing different levels of GSTM1 (RT-PCR, Western blot, and enzyme activity). Cells overexpressing GSTM1 displayed a 3- to 4-fold increase in resistance to anticancer drugs vincristine (VCR) and chlorambucil (CHB) in proliferation, cytotoxic, and clonogenic survival assays. Inhibitors of MRP1 (sulfinpyrazone, verapamil) and GST (dicumarol, curcumin) completely reversed the GSTM1-associated resistance to VCR, indicating that a MRP efflux function is necessary to potentiate GSTM1-mediated resistance to VCR. Conversely, MRP1 inhibitors had no effect on the sensitivity to CHB. Using immunofluorescence assay, GSTM1 was also shown to protect microtubule network integrity from VCR-induced inhibition of microtubule polymerization. In conclusion, these results show that GSTM1 alone is involved in melanoma resistance to CHB, whereas it can act in synergy with MRP1 to protect cells from toxic effects of VCR.
1359745	5-Lipoxygenase inhibitors for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.	The unique role of the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) in the production of leukotrienes (LTs) makes it a likely target for biochemical manipulation. The rationale for using 5-LO inhibitors for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is based on the increased generation of LTs in the inflamed mucosa, LTB4 being the most potent chemotactic and chemokinetic metabolite of arachidonic acid. Furthermore, conventional drugs, such as corticosteroids, sulphasalazine, and 5-aminosalicylic acid, inhibit LT production and specific 5-LO inhibition accelerates healing in animal models of acute colitis. The compounds identified as 5-LO inhibitors can be divided into antioxidants, substrate-analogous, and a large miscellaneous group of inhibitors, where hydroxamic acids are potent and more selective inhibitors of 5-LO. The benzothiophene hydroxyurea, zileuton, is the first selective 5-LO inhibitor evaluated for the treatment of patients with IBD. An 800-mg oral dose of zileuton was shown to reduce LTB4, but not prostaglandin E2, concentrations by 75-85% in rectal dialysates from patients with active ulcerative colitis. The clinical efficacy of zileuton 800 mg b.i.d. has also been tested in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in similar patients. Zileuton significantly improved the symptom scores and the histology score, but not the sigmoidoscopy score, compared to pretreatment conditions and with response to placebo, the beneficial effects being most pronounced in patients not receiving concomitant sulphasalazine treatment. The mean inhibition of LTB4 in the target tissue of inflammation was 70%. The proof that any putative 5-LO inhibitor is blocking LT production is an important stage in assessing any such drug. The main disadvantage of existing new LT inhibitors relates to the high potency of LTs, and unless a higher level of inhibition can be achieved, endogenous LTs may still be present in sufficient amounts to produce their effects.
22430206	Yes and Lyn play a role in nuclear translocation of the epidermal growth factor receptor.	The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a central regulator of tumor progression in human cancers. Cetuximab is an anti-EGFR antibody that has been approved for use in oncology. Previously we investigated mechanisms of resistance to cetuximab using a model derived from the non-small cell lung cancer line NCI-H226. We demonstrated that cetuximab-resistant clones (Ctx(R)) had increased nuclear localization of the EGFR. This process was mediated by Src family kinases (SFKs), and nuclear EGFR had a role in resistance to cetuximab. To better understand SFK-mediated nuclear translocation of EGFR, we investigated which SFK member(s) controlled this process as well as the EGFR tyrosine residues that are involved. Analyses of mRNA and protein expression indicated upregulation of the SFK members Yes (v-Yes-1 yamaguchi sarcoma viral oncogene) and Lyn (v-yes-1 Yamaguchi sarcoma viral-related oncogene homolog) in all Ctx(R) clones. Further, immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that EGFR interacts with Yes and Lyn in Ctx(R) clones, but not in cetuximab-sensitive (Ctx(S)) parental cells. Using RNAi interference, we found that knockdown of either Yes or Lyn led to loss of EGFR translocation to the nucleus. Conversely, overexpression of Yes or Lyn in low nuclear EGFR-expressing Ctx(S) parental cells led to increased nuclear EGFR. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays confirmed nuclear EGFR complexes associated with the promoter of the known EGFR target genes B-Myb and iNOS. Further, all Ctx(R) clones exhibited upregulation of B-Myb and iNOS at the mRNA and protein levels. siRNAs directed at Yes or Lyn led to decreased binding of EGFR complexes to the B-Myb and iNOS promoters based on ChIP analyses. SFKs have been shown to phosphorylate EGFR on tyrosines 845 and 1101 (Y845 and Y1101), and mutation of Y1101, but not Y845, impaired nuclear entry of the EGFR. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that Yes and Lyn phosphorylate EGFR at Y1101, which influences EGFR nuclear translocation in this model of cetuximab resistance.
10773011	Cyclooxygenase-2 contributes to N-methyl-D-aspartate-mediated neuronal cell death in primary cortical cell culture.	Cyclooxygenase isozymes (COX-1 and COX-2) are found to be constitutively expressed in brain, with neuronal expression of COX-2 being rapidly induced after numerous insults, including cerebral ischemia. Because overactivation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors has been implicated in the cell loss associated with ischemia, we characterized the expression of the COX isozymes in murine mixed cortical cell cultures and used isozyme-selective inhibitors to determine their relative contribution to NMDA receptor-stimulated prostaglandin (PG) production and excitotoxic neuronal cell death. Immunocytochemical analysis of mixed cortical cell cultures revealed that COX-2 expression was restricted to neurons, whereas COX-1 was expressed in both neurons and astrocytes. Brief exposure to NMDA (5 min; 100 microM) elicited a time-dependent accumulation of PGs in the culture medium that preceded neuronal cell death and correlated with the induction of COX-2 mRNA. COX-1 expression remained unchanged. Flurbiprofen, a nonselective COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor, blocked NMDA-stimulated PG production and attenuated neuronal death in a concentration-dependent manner. Similar results were obtained with the specific COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 (10-30 microM) but not with the selective COX-1 inhibitor valeryl salicylate (10-300 microM). Inhibition of total constitutive COX activity with aspirin (100 microM, 1.5 h) before NMDA exposure did not prevent subsequent NMDA-mediated neuronal cell death. However, neuronal injury in aspirin-pretreated cultures was attenuated by flurbiprofen administration after NMDA exposure. Finally, the protection afforded by COX-2 inhibition was specific for NMDA because neither flurbiprofen nor NS-398 protected neurons against kainate-mediated neurotoxicity. Together, these results support the conclusion that newly synthesized COX-2 protein contributes to NMDA-induced neuronal injury.
23000450	-116A and K BCHE gene variants associated with obesity and hypertriglyceridemia in adolescents from Southern Brazil.	Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) has been associated to body mass index (BMI), weight, cholesterol and triglyceride levels. -116A (rs1126680) and K (A539T, 1615A, rs1803274) BCHE gene variants had previously been associated to BChE activity, weight and BMI variance in adults. The present study examined -116A and K variants, BChE activity, anthropometric and biochemical variables associated with obesity in adolescents (120 obese and 150 non-obese from Curitiba, Brazil). Both -116A and K variants were found with significantly lower frequencies (p<0.05) in obese adolescents when compared with non-obese adolescents and with the general population. Mean BChE activity (KU/L) was significantly higher in obese adolescents when compared with non-obese adolescents and with the general population. Analyzing only the obese adolescents, it was found that carriers of the -116A variant showed lower BChE activity and higher triglyceride levels than homozygotes for the usual allele. Indeed, obese carriers of the -116A variant had triglyceride levels considered high according to reference values for serum triglycerides in Brazilian adolescents. These results show: (1) a protective effect of -116A and K variants on juvenile obesity risk, suggesting a role for the BCHE gene on juvenile onset obesity different from that observed on adult onset obesity and (2) an association of the -116A variant with hypertriglyceridemia in obese adolescents probably because of its effect on lowering BChE activity and consequently diminishing the enzyme capability of maintaining homeostasis on lipid metabolism during the metabolic stress caused by obesity.
7902561	Neurochemical mechanism of action of anorectic drugs.	Studies with dexfenfluramine, an anorectic agent which releases 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) from nerve terminals and inhibits its reuptake, have considerably increased our knowledge of the role of 5-HT in feeding control. 5-HT1B receptors mediate the satiating effect of dexfenfluramine, whereas the mechanism by which 5-HT uptake inhibitors such as fluoxetine and sertraline cause anorexia is not clear. Anorexia induced by (+)-amphetamine, phentermine, diethylpropion and phenylpropanolamine seems to be the result of their ability to increase the release of noradrenaline and/or dopamine from nerve terminals and inhibit their reuptake or, in the case of phenylpropanolamine, to stimulate directly alpha 1-adrenoceptors. It has been suggested that beta- and alpha 1-adrenoceptors and D1 dopamine receptors are involved in their effect on food intake. The difficulties of extrapolation across species limit our knowledge of the mechanism of the anorectic action in humans. Significant advances in the treatment of feeding pathology will be linked to identifying new receptor types and subtypes for neurotransmitters and quantifying and modelling eating disorders such as binge-eating and food craving.
23386417	Androgen Receptor mRNA Measured by Quantitative Real Time PCR is Decreased in the Urethral Mucosa of Patients with Middle Idiopathic Hypospadias.	Androgen action is exerted through the androgen receptor. The normal 46,XY genital virilization depends on androgen receptor gene expression, which is tissue specific, and requires normal androgen receptor mRNA levels in androgen sensitive tissues. Hypospadias is a frequent male genital abnormality, potentially related to reduced androgen sensitivity in genital tissues. The aim of this study was to compare, by quantitative real time PCR, the amount of androgen receptor mRNA in cells obtained from the urethral mucosa of patients with middle idiopathic hypospadias with the androgen receptor mRNA levels observed in control phimosis subjects with eutopic urethral opening. Prepubertal individuals were studied, including 41 controls and 17 hypospadias patients with mean (SD) ages of 4.7 (2.1) years and 4.0 (3.0) years, respectively. We observed significantly less androgen receptor mRNA in the urethral mucosa of patients with hypospadias than in the controls (p=0.002). The correlation between the level of androgen receptor mRNA expression and the penile size was almost statistically significant only in hypospadias patients (r=0.47; p=0.053). We also established the number of CAG repeats in exon 1 of the androgen receptor gene by GeneScan analysis. No significant difference was observed in the number of CAG repeats when patients and controls were compared. A negative correlation between the CAG repeats and penile size was detected in patients with hypospadias, but not in controls. Our data suggest that a critical lower level of androgen receptor mRNA expression could be a determining factor in the development of middle hypospadias.
11444497	Effect of the AT1-receptor antagonists losartan, irbesartan, and telmisartan on angiotensin II-induced facilitation of sympathetic neurotransmission in the rat mesenteric artery.	SUMMARY: The effect of the AT1-receptor antagonists losartan, irbesartan, and telmisartan on angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced facilitation of noradrenergic neurotransmission was investigated in the isolated rat mesenteric artery under isometric conditions. Electrical field stimulation (2, 4, and 8 Hz) caused a frequency-dependent increase of contractile force. At stimulation frequencies of 2, 4, and 8 Hz, Ang 11 (10 nM) increased the stimulation-induced vasoconstrictor responses by a factor 4.8 +/- 0.9, 2.9 +/- 0.7, and 1.3 +/- 0.1, respectively (p < 0.05 compared with control for all frequencies). The enhancement could be concentration-dependently antagonized by losartan (1 nM-1 microM), irbesartan (0.1 nM-0.1 microM), and telmisartan (0.01 nM-0.01 microM). At a stimulation frequency of 2 Hz, the relation between stimulation-induced vasoconstrictor responses (in presence of Ang II 10 nM) and the concentration of the AT1-antagonists used could be described by linear regression. The order of potency concerning sympathoinhibition was telmisartan > irbesartan > losartan (p < 0.05 between linear regression lines). Contractile responses to exogenous noradrenaline were unaltered in the presence of Ang II 10 nM. We conclude that the facilitating effect of Ang II on noradrenergic neurotransmission is mediated by presynaptically located AT1-receptors. Conversely, this facilitating effect can be dose-dependently counteracted by blockade of these receptors. Sympathoinhibitory properties are likely to contribute to the therapeutic effect of AT1-blockers, in particular in conditions in which the sympathetic nervous system is activated, such as congestive heart failure and hypertension.
16277658	Role of retinoic acid receptors in squamous-cell carcinoma in human esophagus.	BACKGROUND: Worldwide, cancer in the esophagus ranks among the 10 most common cancers. Alterations of retinoic acid receptors (e.g. RARalpha, beta, gamma, and RXRalpha, beta, gamma) expression is considered to play an important role in development of squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC), which is the most common esophageal cancer. Alcohol consumption and smoking, which can alter retinoic acid receptor levels, have been identified as key risk factors in the development of carcinoma in the aero-digestive tract. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate protein levels of retinoic acid receptors (i.e. RARalpha, beta, gamma, and RXRbeta) in esophageal SCC and surrounding normal tissue of patients with untreated SCC and controls. METHODS: All study participants completed a questionnaire concerning smoking and alcohol drinking habits as well as anthropometrical parameters. Protein levels of RARalpha, beta, gamma, and RXRbeta were determined by Western Blot in normal esophageal tissue and tissue obtained from SCC of 21 patients with newly diagnosed esophageal SCC and normal esophageal tissue of 10 controls. RESULTS: Protein levels of RARgamma were significantly lower by approximately 68% in SCC compared to normal surrounding tissue in patients with SCC that smoked and/or consumed elevated amounts of alcohol. Furthermore, RARalpha protein levels were significantly lower (approximately- 45%) in SCC in comparison to normal esophageal mucosa in patients with elevated alcohol intake. When comparing protein levels of retinoic acid receptors between normal tissue of patients with SCC and controls, RARgamma protein levels were found to be significantly higher (approximately 2.7-fold) in normal esophageal tissue of SCC patients than in esophageal tissue obtained from controls. No differences were found for RARalpha, beta, and RXRbeta protein levels between normal esophageal tissue of patients and that of controls. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, results of the present study suggest that alterations of retinoic acid receptors protein may contribute in the development of SCC in esophagus and that in some patients life style (e.g. smoking and alcohol consumption) may be a critical component in the alteration of retinoic acid receptor levels in esophagus.
25136065	Albiglutide: a new GLP-1 receptor agonist for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.	OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of albiglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) in type 2 diabetes (T2D). DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search (1950-June 2014) was conducted using the keyword albiglutide. References were reviewed to identify additional sources. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Articles evaluating pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, or efficacy of albiglutide were included. DATA SYNTHESIS: Albiglutide is a long-acting GLP-1 RA that lowers glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) and reduces weight by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion, suppressing glucagon secretion, delaying gastric emptying, and promoting satiety. Albiglutide has a long half-life as a result of resistance to degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 and fusion to albumin, thus allowing once-weekly dosing. Albiglutide has been studied as monotherapy and add-on therapy to metformin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, insulin glargine, and varying combinations of these agents. Clinical studies have shown albiglutide to be superior to placebo, sitagliptin, and glimepiride and noninferior to insulin glargine and insulin lispro at reducing A1C in T2D patients, with A1C changes from baseline ranging from -0.55% to -0.9%. Noninferiority was not achieved when compared to liraglutide and pioglitazone. Weight changes ranged from +0.28 to -1.21 kg. The most common side effects are upper-respiratory-tract infections, diarrhea, nausea, and injection-site reactions. CONCLUSION: Albiglutide is the fourth GLP-1 RA approved in the United States. Advantages include once-weekly dosing and fewer gastrointestinal side effects compared with liraglutide, but it is less effective at reducing A1C and weight compared to liraglutide. It has not been compared head to head with other GLP-1 RAs.
17119350	Bcl-2 phosphorylation has pathological significance in human breast cancer.	The anti-apoptotic molecule, Bcl-2, is well known to play an important role in the chemoresistance of breast cancer. We have previously demonstrated that phosphorylation of Fas-associated death domain-containing protein (FADD) at 194 serine through c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) activation sensitizes breast cancer cells to chemotherapy through accelerating cell cycle arrest at G2/M, and that Bcl-2 phosphorylation downstream of JNK/FADD plays an important role in cell growth suppression by paclitaxel. In this study, the clinicopathological association of phosphorylated Bcl-2 (P-Bcl-2) with estrogen, progesterone, c-erbB-2 receptors, p53 expressions and phosphorylated FADD/JNK (P-FADD/JNK) was analyzed immunohistochemically using 107 human breast cancer specimens. Expression of P-Bcl-2 was found to significantly correlate with lymphatic invasion, lymph node metastasis, but not histological differentiation, tumor grade or vascular and fatty invasion. The positivity of P-Bcl-2 was also significantly correlated to that of P-FADD/JNK. Thus, P-Bcl-2 as well as the P-FADD/JNK parameter might be useful markers for cancer progression, independent of the hormone receptor status, in human breast cancers.
17253779	Specificity of zebrafish retinol saturase: formation of all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol and all-trans-7,8- dihydroretinol.	Metabolism of vitamin A, all-trans-retinol, leads to the formation of 11-cis-retinaldehyde, the visual chromophore, and all-trans-retinoic acid, which is involved in the regulation of gene expression through the retinoic acid receptor. Enzymes and binding proteins involved in retinoid metabolism are highly conserved across species. We previously described a novel mammalian enzyme that saturates the 13-14 double bond of all-trans-retinol to produce all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol, which then follows the same metabolic fate as that of all-trans-retinol. Specifically, all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol is transiently oxidized to all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinoic acid before being oxidized further by Cyp26 enzymes. Here, we report the identification of two putative RetSat homologues in zebrafish, one of which, zebrafish RetSat A (zRetSat A), also had retinol saturase activity, whereas zebrafish RetSat B (zRetSat B) was inactive under similar conditions. Unlike mouse RetSat (mRetSat), zRetSat A had an altered bond specificity saturating either the 13-14 or 7-8 double bonds of all-trans-retinol to produce either all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol or all-trans-7,8-dihydroretinol, respectively. zRetSat A also saturated the 13-14 or 7-8 double bonds of all-trans-3,4-didehydroretinol (vitamin A2), a second endogenous form of vitamin A in zebrafish. The dual enzymatic activity of zRetSat A displays a newly acquired specificity for the 13-14 double bond retained in higher vertebrates and also the evolutionarily preserved activity of bacterial phytoene desaturases and plant carotenoid isomerases. Expression of zRetSat A was restricted to the liver and intestine of hatchlings and adult zebrafish, whereas zRetSat B was expressed in the same tissues but at earlier developmental stages. Exogenous all-trans-retinol, all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol, or all-trans-7,8-dihydroretinol led to the strong induction of the expression of the retinoic acid-metabolizing enzyme, Cyp26A1, arguing for an active signaling function of dihydroretinoid metabolites in zebrafish. These findings point to a conserved function but altered specificity of RetSat in vertebrates, leading to the generation of various dihydroretinoid compounds, some of which could have signaling functions.
15621150	An exploratory study on pharmacogenetics of inosine-monophosphate dehydrogenase II in peripheral mononuclear cells from liver-transplant recipients.	Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is an immunosuppressant used for the prophylaxis of rejection in renal, pancreas, and liver transplantation. It inhibits the inducible isoform of the enzyme inosine-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH II) via its active metabolite mycophenolic acid (MPA). IMPDH II is necessary for de novo purine synthesis in activated lymphocytes. The aims of the present study were to evaluate the feasibility of a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) quantitative assessment of IMPDH II gene expression in liver transplant recipients as well as to provide a preliminary evaluation of possible correlations with drug tolerability. RNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of liver recipients after at least 6 months of MMF administration. IMPDH II gene expression was assessed using quantitative, real-time PCR and normalized using glyceraldheyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Finally, adverse events associated with MMF administration were recorded. Real-time PCR quantitation of IMPDH II gene expression was reliable, sensitive, and specific. The intrapatient variability for both IMPDH II and GAPDH assays was lower than 0.6% in all patients. The results demonstrated a wide interpatient variability, with the mean value +/- standard deviation of 0.949 +/- 0.525 (95% confidence interval, 0.669-1.229) and a median value of 0.797. Patients with treatment-related toxicities displayed a trend to a higher level of IMPDH II expression than those without toxicity (mean, 1.126 vs 0.771). In conclusion, pharmacogenetic analysis of IMPDH II may represent a novel approach to MMF therapeutic monitoring.
11018726	The active-site residue tyr-175 in human glyoxalase II contributes to binding of glutathione derivatives.	Tyrosine-175 located in the active site of human glyoxalase II was replaced by phenylalanine in order to study the contribution of this residue to catalysis. The mutation had a marginal effect on the k(cat) value determined using S-D-lactoylglutathione as substrate. However, the Y175F mutant had an 8-fold higher K(m) value than the wild-type enzyme. The competitive inhibitor S-(N-hydroxy-N-bromophenylcarbamoyl)glutathione had a 30-fold higher K(i) value towards the mutant, than that of the wild-type. Pre-equilibrium fluorescence studies with the inhibitor showed that this was due to a significantly increased off-rate for the mutant enzyme. The phenolic hydroxyl group of tyrosine-175 is within hydrogen bonding distance of the amide nitrogen of the glycine in the glutathione moiety and the present study shows that this interaction makes a significant contribution to the binding of the active-site ligand.
23588252	Changes in mRNA and protein expression in the renal cortex of male and female F344 rats treated with bromate.	Bromate (BrO3 (-)), a by-product of ozonation of drinking water, induces nephrotoxicity in male rats at much lower doses than in female rats. This difference appears to be related to the development of α-2u-globulin nephropathy in males. To determine sex-dependent changes in mRNA and protein expression in the renal cortex attributable to α-2u-globulin nephropathy, we performed microarray and immunohistochemical analyses in proximal renal tubules of male and female F344 rats treated with KBrO3 for 28 days. Particular attention was paid to molecular biomarkers of renal tubular injury. Microarray analysis of male and female rats treated with BrO3 (-) at low doses (125 mg/L KBrO3) displayed marked sex-dependent changes in renal gene expression. The greatest differences were seen in genes encoding for cellular differentiation, apoptosis, ion transport, and cell proliferation. Differences by sex were especially prominent for the cell cycle checkpoint gene p21, the renal injury protein Kim-1, and the kidney injury and cancer biomarker protein osteopontin. Dose-related nephrotoxicity, assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining, was greater in males compared to female rats, as was cellular proliferation, assessed by bromodeoxyuridine staining. The fraction of proximal renal cells with elevated 8-oxodeoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) was only increased at the high dose and did not differ by sex. Dose-dependent increases in the expression of osteopontin were detected immunohistochemically only in male rats and were localized in proximal tubule cells. Similarly, BrO3 (-) treatment increased clusterin and Kim-1 staining in the proximal tubules; however, staining for these proteins did not differ appreciably between males and females. These data demonstrate both qualitative and quantitative differences in the response of male versus female kidneys to BrO3 (-)-treatment. These sex-dependent effects likely contribute to renal carcinogenesis of BrO3 (-) in the male rat.
22469988	miR-143 regulates hexokinase 2 expression in cancer cells.	Tumor cells activate pathways that facilitate and stimulate glycolysis even in the presence of adequate levels of oxygen in order to satisfy their continuous need of molecules, such as nucleotides, ATP and fatty acids, necessary to support their rapid proliferation. Accordingly, a variety of human tumors are characterized by elevated expression levels of the hexokinase 2 isoform (HK2). Although different molecular mechanisms, including genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, have been suggested to account for the altered expression of HK2 in tumors, the potential role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the regulation of HK2 expression has not been evaluated. Here, we report that miR-143 inhibits HK2 expression via a conserved miR-143 recognition motif located in the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of HK2 mRNA. We demonstrate that miR143 inhibits HK2 expression both in primary keratinocytes and in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)-derived cell lines. Importantly, we found that miR-143 inversely correlates with HK2 expression in HNSCC-derived cell lines and in primary tumors. We also report that the miRNA-dependent regulation of hexokinase expression is not limited to HK2 as miR-138 targets HK1 via a specific recognition motif located in its 3'UTR. All these data unveil a new miRNA-dependent mechanism of regulation of hexokinase expression potentially important in the regulation of glucose metabolism of cancer cells.
23481595	Identification of mRNAs bound and regulated by human LIN28 proteins and molecular requirements for RNA recognition.	Human LIN28A and LIN28B are RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) conserved in animals with important roles during development and stem cell reprogramming. We used Photoactivatable-Ribonucleoside-Enhanced Crosslinking and Immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) in HEK293 cells and identified a largely overlapping set of ∼3000 mRNAs at ∼9500 sites located in the 3' UTR and CDS. In vitro and in vivo, LIN28 preferentially bound single-stranded RNA containing a uridine-rich element and one or more flanking guanosines and appeared to be able to disrupt base-pairing to access these elements when embedded in predicted secondary structure. In HEK293 cells, LIN28 protein binding mildly stabilized target mRNAs and increased protein abundance. The top targets were its own mRNAs and those of other RBPs and cell cycle regulators. Alteration of LIN28 protein levels also negatively regulated the abundance of some but not all let-7 miRNA family members, indicating sequence-specific binding of let-7 precursors to LIN28 proteins and competition with cytoplasmic miRNA biogenesis factors.
1362160	Suppression by cetirizine of pleurisy triggered by antigen in actively sensitized rats.	The efficacy of cetirizine in comparison with meclizine, another piperazine H1 receptor antagonist, in rat pleurisy caused by allergen or autacoid was investigated. Sensitization was achieved by subcutaneous injection of a mixture of ovalbumin and aluminium hydroxide. Fourteen days later, the animals were challenged with an intrathoracic injection of ovalbumin (12 micrograms/cavity), which caused drastic mast cell degranulation, followed by pleural oedema and leucocyte influx. Cetirizine and meclizine (2.5-30 mg/kg i.p.), 1 h before challenge, inhibited the exudatory response evoked by antigen, under conditions where neutrophil and eosinophil accumulation was affected only by the former. When administered intrathoracically 22 h after allergen, i.e. using a curative approach, cetirizine (15 micrograms/cavity) drastically reduced the pleural eosinophilia noted 24 h post-challenge, indicating that this drug can reverse an already established eosinophilia. Cetirizine (15 mg/kg i.p.) also restored, to about 39% (P < 0.001), the number of uninjured mast cells recovered from the pleural cavity following allergen stimulation. In normal rats, cetirizine (5-15 micrograms/cavity) completely inhibited the pleural exudation elicited by histamine and only partially the exudation caused by 5-hydroxytryptamine or bradykinin, but was quite inactive against platelet-activating factor. We conclude that the pleural exudation triggered by allergen, vasoactive amines or bradykinin is clearly sensitive to cetirizine. In addition, the ability of the drug to interfere with pleural neutrophil or eosinophil mobilization and mast cell degranulation seems not to be associated with its ability to block the histamine H1 receptor.
23395652	Structural analogs of huperzine A improve survival in guinea pigs exposed to soman.	Chemical warfare nerve agents such as soman exert their toxic effects through an irreversible inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and subsequently glutamatergic function, leading to uncontrolled seizures. The natural alkaloid (-)-huperzine A is a potent inhibitor of AChE and has been demonstrated to exert neuroprotection at an appropriate dose. It is hypothesized that analogs of both (+)- and (-)-huperzine A with an improved ability to interact with NMDA receptors together with reduced AChE inhibition will exhibit more effective neuroprotection against nerve agents. In this manuscript, the tested huperzine A analogs 2 and 3 were demonstrated to improve survival of guinea pigs exposed to soman at either 1.2 or 2×LD(50).
23262390	Manganese exposure induces α-synuclein aggregation in the frontal cortex of non-human primates.	Aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn) in the brain is a defining pathological feature of neurodegenerative disorders classified as synucleinopathies. They include Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple system atrophy (MSA). Occupational and environmental exposure to manganese (Mn) is associated with a neurological syndrome consisting of psychiatric symptoms, cognitive impairment and parkinsonism. In this study, we examined α-syn immunoreactivity in the frontal cortex of Cynomolgus macaques as part of a multidisciplinary assessment of the neurological effects produced by exposure to moderate levels of Mn. We found increased α-syn-positive cells in the gray matter of Mn-exposed animals, typically observed in pyramidal and medium-sized neurons in deep cortical layers. Some of these neurons displayed loss of Nissl staining with α-syn-positive spherical aggregates. In the white matter we also observed α-syn-positive glial cells and in some cases α-syn-positive neurites. These findings suggest that Mn exposure promotes α-syn aggregation in neuronal and glial cells that may ultimately lead to degeneration in the frontal cortex gray and white matter. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Mn-induced neuronal and glial cell α-syn accumulation and aggregation in the frontal cortex of non-human primates.
16597615	Physiological oxygenation status is required for fully differentiated phenotype in kidney cortex proximal tubules.	Hypoxia has been suspected to trigger transdifferentiation of renal tubular cells into myofibroblasts in an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. To determine the functional networks potentially altered by hypoxia, rat renal tubule suspensions were incubated under three conditions of oxygenation ranging from normoxia (lactate uptake) to severe hypoxia (lactate production). Transcriptome changes after 4 h were analyzed on a high scale by restriction fragment differential display. Among 1,533 transcripts found, 42% were maximally expressed under severe hypoxia and 8% under mild hypoxia (Po(2) = 48 mmHg), suggesting two different levels of oxygen sensing. Normoxia was required for full expression of the proximal tubule-specific transcripts 25-hydroxyvitamin D 1-hydroxylase (Cyp27b1) and l-pyruvate kinase (Pklr), transcripts involved in tissue cohesion such as fibronectin (Fn1) and N-cadherin (Cdh2), and non-muscle-type myosin transcripts. Mild hypoxia increased myogenin transcript level. Conversely, severe hypoxia increased transcripts involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, those of muscle-type myosins, and others involved in creatine phosphate synthesis and lactate transport (Slc16a7). Accordingly, microscopy showed loss of tubule aggregation under hypoxia, without tubular disruption. Hypoxia also increased the levels of kidney-specific transcripts normally restricted to the less oxygenated medullary zone and others specific for the distal part of the nephron. We conclude that extensive oxygen supply to the kidney tubule favors expression of its differentiated functions specifically in the proximal tubule, whose embryonic origin is mesenchymal. The phenotype changes could potentially permit transient adaptation to hypoxia but also favor pathological processes such as tissue invasion.
16534527	Antiobesity action of peripheral exenatide (exendin-4) in rodents: effects on food intake, body weight, metabolic status and side-effect measures.	BACKGROUND: Exenatide (exendin-4) is an incretin mimetic currently marketed as an antidiabetic agent for patients with type 2 diabetes. In preclinical models, a reduction in body weight has also been shown in low-fat-fed, leptin receptor-deficient rodents. OBJECTIVE: To more closely model the polygenic and environmental state of human obesity, we characterized the effect of exenatide on food intake and body weight in high-fat-fed, normal (those with an intact leptin signaling system) rodents. As glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonism has been found to elicit behaviors associated with visceral illness in rodents, we also examined the effect of peripheral exenatide on kaolin consumption and locomotor activity. METHODS AND RESULTS: High-fat-fed C57BL/6 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with exenatide (3, 10 and 30 microg/kg/day) for 4 weeks via subcutaneously implanted osmotic pumps. Food intake and body weight were assessed weekly. At 4 weeks, body composition and plasma metabolic profiles were measured. Kaolin consumption and locomotor activity were measured in fasted Sprague-Dawley rats following a single intraperitoneal injection of exenatide (0.1-10 microg/kg). Exenatide treatment in mice and rats dose-dependently decreased food intake and body weight; significant reductions in body weight gain were observed throughout treatment at 10 and 30 microg/kg/day (P<0.05). Decreased body weight gain was associated with a significant decrease in fat mass (P<0.05) with sparing of lean tissue. Plasma cholesterol, triglycerides and insulin were also significantly reduced (P<0.05). Exenatide at 10 microg/kg significantly reduced food intake (P<0.05) but failed to induce kaolin intake. In general, locomotor activity was reduced at doses of exenatide that decreased food intake, although a slightly higher dose was required to produce significant changes in activity. CONCLUSION: Systemic exenatide reduces body weight gain in normal, high-fat-fed rodents, a model that parallels human genetic variation and food consumption patterns, and may play a role in metabolic pathways mediating food intake.
23570561	Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Urea Derivatives as Highly Potent and Selective Rho Kinase Inhibitors.	RhoA and its downstream effector ROCK mediate stress fiber formation and cell contraction through their effects on the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC). Inhibition of the RhoA/ROCK pathway has proven to be a promising strategy for several indications such as cardiovascular disease, glaucoma, and inflammatory disease. In 2010, our group reported urea-based ROCK inhibitors as potential antiglaucoma agents. These compounds showed potent IC50 values in enzymatic and cell-based assays and significant intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering effects in rats (∼7 mmHg). (22) To develop more advanced ROCK inhibitors targeting various potential applications (such as myocardial infarction, erectile dysfunction, multiple sclerosis, etc.) in addition to glaucoma, a thorough SAR for this urea-based scaffold was studied. The detailed optimization process, counter-screening, and in vitro and in vivo DMPK studies are discussed. Potent and selective ROCK inhibitors with various in vivo pharmacokinetic properties were discovered.
10587286	Preferential cerebrospinal fluid acetylcholinesterase inhibition by rivastigmine in humans.	This study sought to examine the feasibility of prolonged assessment of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of volunteers and to test the hypothesis that rivastigmine (ENA-713; Exelon, Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland) selectively inhibits AChE in CSF in humans at a dose producing minimal inhibition of the peripheral enzyme. Lumbar CSF samples were collected continuously (0.1 mL x min(-1)) for 49 hours from eight healthy volunteers who took either placebo or a single oral dose of rivastigmine (3 mg). CSF specimens and samples of blood cells and blood plasma were analyzed at intervals for rivastigmine and its metabolite NAP 226-90 ([-] [3-([1-dimethylaminolethyl)-phenol]), erythrocyte AChE activity, CSF AChE activity, and plasma and CSF butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) activity. Safety evaluations were performed 23 hours after drug dosing and at the end of the study. Evaluable data were obtained from six subjects. The mean time to maximal rivastigmine plasma concentration (tmax) was 0.83 +/- 0.26 hours, the mean maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) was 4.88 +/- 3.82 ng x mL(-1), the mean plasma area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC0-infinity) was 7.43 +/- 4.74 ng x hr x mL(-1), and the mean plasma t1/2 was 0.85 +/- 0.115 hours. The concentration of rivastigmine in CSF was lower than the quantification limit for assay (0.65 ng x mL(-1)), but NAP 226-90 reached a mean Cmax of 3.14 +/- 0.57 ng x mL(-1). Only minimal inhibition of erythrocyte AChE activity (approximately 3%) was observed. Inhibition of AChE in the CSF after rivastigmine administration was significantly greater than after placebo for up to 8.4 hours after the dose and was maximal (40%) at 2.4 hours. Plasma BuChE activity was significantly lower after rivastigmine than after placebo, but this was not clinically relevant. BuChE activity in CSF was significantly lower after rivastigmine than after placebo for up to 3.6 hours after dosing, but this difference was not sustained. This study confirms the feasibility of using continuous measurement of AChE activity in CSF over prolonged periods, that rivastigmine markedly inhibits CSF AChE after a single oral dose of 3 mg, and that the inhibition of central AChE is substantially greater than that of peripheral AChE or BuChE.
23243659	Sponge-like Ni(OH)2-NiF2 composite film with excellent electrochemical performance.	Sponge-like porous Ni(OH)(2)-NiF(2) composite (PNC) film was successfully synthesized by the anodization of nickel in a NH(4)F and H(3)PO(4) containing electrolyte. Thanks to the good conductivity and the highly porous architecture, PNC exhibited not only a high specific capacitance, but also a superior rate capability and a good cyclability (2090 F g(-1) at 10 mV s(-1), capacitance >1200 F g(-1) at 100 A g(-1) after 2000 cycles). Anodization of nickel is proven to be fast and facile and can be easily scaled up. The method described here is promising for the fabrication of supercapacitor electrodes with excellent performance.
23388705	Transport of A1 adenosine receptor agonist tecadenoson by human and mouse nucleoside transporters: evidence for blood-brain barrier transport by murine equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 mENT1.	The high density of A1 adenosine receptors in the brain results in significant potential for central nervous system (CNS)-related adverse effects with A1 agonists. Tecadenoson is a selective A1 adenosine receptor agonist with close similarity to adenosine. We studied the binding and transmembrane transport of tecadenoson by recombinant human equilibrative nucleoside transporters (hENTs) hENT1 and hENT2, and human concentrative nucleoside transporters (hCNTs) hCNT1, hCNT2, and hCNT3 in vitro and by mouse mENT1 in vivo. Binding affinities of the five recombinant human nucleoside transporters for tecadenoson differed (hENT1 > hCNT1 > hCNT3 > hENT2 > hCNT2), and tecadenoson was transported largely by hENT1. Pretreatment of mice with a phosphorylated prodrug of nitrobenzylmercaptopurine riboside, an inhibitor of mENT1, significantly decreased brain exposure to tecadenoson compared with that of the untreated (control) group, suggesting involvement of mENT1 in transport of tecadenoson across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In summary, ENT1 was shown to mediate the transport of tecadenoson in vitro with recombinant and native human protein and in vivo with mice. The micromolar apparent Km value of tecadenoson for transport by native hENT1 in cultured cells suggests that hENT1 will not be saturated at clinically relevant (i.e., nanomolar) concentrations of tecadenoson, and that hENT1-mediated passage across the BBB may contribute to the adverse CNS effects observed in clinical trials. In contrast, in cases in which a CNS effect is desired, the present results illustrate that synthetic A1 agonists that are transported by hENT1 could be used to target CNS disorders because of enhanced delivery to the brain.
11799102	Angiotensin II suppression in humans by the orally active renin inhibitor Aliskiren (SPP100): comparison with enalapril.	Renin is the main determinant of angiotensin (Ang) II levels. It, therefore, always appeared desirable to reduce Ang II levels by direct inhibition of renin. So far, specific renin inhibitors lacked potency and/or oral availability. We tested the new orally active nonpeptidic renin inhibitor SPP100 (Aliskiren, an octanamide with a 50% inhibitory concentration [IC50] in the low nanomolar range) in 18 healthy volunteers on a constant 100 mmol/d sodium diet using a double-blind, 3-way crossover protocol. In 3 periods of 8 days, separated by wash-outs of 6 days, each volunteer received 2 dosage levels of Aliskiren (low before high; 40 and 80 or 160 and 640 mg/d) and randomized placebo or 20 mg enalapril. Aliskiren was well tolerated. Not surprisingly, blood pressure and heart rate remained unchanged in these normotensive subjects. There was a dose-dependent decrease in plasma renin activity, Ang I, and Ang II following single doses of Aliskiren starting with 40 mg. Inhibition was still marked and significant after repeated dosing with maximal decreases in Ang II levels by 89% and 75% on Days 1 and 8, respectively, when the highest dose of Aliskiren was compared with placebo. At the same time, mean plasma active renin was increased 16- and 34-fold at the highest dose of Aliskiren. Plasma drug levels of Aliskiren were dose-dependent with maximal concentrations reached between 3 to 6 hours after administration; steady state was reached between 5 and 8 days after multiple dosing. Less than 1% of dose was excreted in the urine. Plasma and urinary aldosterone levels were decreased after doses of Aliskiren > or =80 mg and after enalapril. Aliskiren at 160 and 640 mg enhanced natriuresis on Day 1 by +45% and +62%, respectively, compared with placebo (100%, ie, 87+/-11 mmol/24h) and enalapril (+54%); kaliuresis remained unchanged. In conclusion, the renin inhibitor Aliskiren dose-dependently decreases Ang II levels in humans following oral administration. The effect is long-lasting and, at a dose of 160 mg, is equivalent to that of 20 mg enalapril. Aliskiren has the potential to become the first orally active renin inhibitor that provides a true alternative to ACE-inhibitors and Ang II receptor antagonists in therapy for hypertension and other cardiovascular and renal diseases.
23554574	Neuronal expression of glucosylceramide synthase in central nervous system regulates body weight and energy homeostasis.	Hypothalamic neurons are main regulators of energy homeostasis. Neuronal function essentially depends on plasma membrane-located gangliosides. The present work demonstrates that hypothalamic integration of metabolic signals requires neuronal expression of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS; UDP-glucose:ceramide glucosyltransferase). As a major mechanism of central nervous system (CNS) metabolic control, we demonstrate that GCS-derived gangliosides interacting with leptin receptors (ObR) in the neuronal membrane modulate leptin-stimulated formation of signaling metabolites in hypothalamic neurons. Furthermore, ganglioside-depleted hypothalamic neurons fail to adapt their activity (c-Fos) in response to alterations in peripheral energy signals. Consequently, mice with inducible forebrain neuron-specific deletion of the UDP-glucose:ceramide glucosyltransferase gene (Ugcg) display obesity, hypothermia, and lower sympathetic activity. Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-mediated Ugcg delivery to the arcuate nucleus (Arc) significantly ameliorated obesity, specifying gangliosides as seminal components for hypothalamic regulation of body energy homeostasis.
20602248	Molecular aspects of cyclophilins mediating therapeutic actions of their ligands.	Cyclosporine A (CsA) is an immunosuppressive cyclic peptide that binds with a high affinity to 18 kDa human cyclophilin-A (hCyPA). CsA and its several natural derivatives have some pharmacological potential in treatment of diverse immune disorders. More than 20 paralogues of CyPA are expressed in the human body while expression levels and functions of numerous ORFs encoding cyclophilin-like sequences remain unknown. Certain derivatives of CsA devoid of immunosuppressive activity may have some potential in treatments of Alzheimer diseases, Hepatitis C and HIV infections, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, congenital muscular dystrophy, asthma and various parasitic infections. Here, we discuss structural and functional aspects of the human cyclophilins and their interaction with various intra-cellular targets that can be under the control of CsA or its complexes with diverse cyclophilins that are selectively expressed in different cellular compartments. Some molecular aspects of the cyclophilins expressed in parasites invading humans and causing diseases were also analyzed.
14678021	The endocrine pancreas in non-diabetic rats after short-term and long-term treatment with the long-acting GLP-1 derivative NN2211.	Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and GLP-1 receptor agonists increase the beta-cell mass in rodent models of type 2 diabetes and enhance the proliferation rate of beta cells in vitro, while the long-term effect in vivo in non-diabetic animals is unknown. We studied the endocrine pancreas in non-diabetic Sprague-Dawley rats after short- and long-term treatment with NN2211, an acetylated long-acting derivative of GLP-1. Four groups of rats (n=6 for each group) received two daily injections with either NN2211 or vehicle for 1 or 6 weeks. NN2211-treated rats displayed a 10% lower body weight after both 1 week (p<0.001) and 6 weeks (p<0.005) of treatment. The mean beta-cell mass in NN2211-treated rats was increased by 19% after 1 week of treatment (p<0.05), but normalized after 6 weeks of treatment. No difference in alpha-cell mass, volume-weighted mean islet volume, or pancreas mass was found after 1 or 6 weeks of treatment. We conclude that NN2211 treatment of non-diabetic rats induces a sustained lower body weight, and an only temporary increase in the beta-cell mass, while the alpha-cell mass and the volume-weighted mean islet volume are unaffected by the treatment.
23547652	3-Hydroxypyridin-2-thione as Novel Zinc Binding Group for Selective Histone Deacetylase Inhibition.	Small molecules bearing hydroxamic acid as the zinc binding group (ZBG) have been the most effective histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) to date. However, concerns about the pharmacokinetic liabilities of the hydroxamic acid moiety have stimulated research efforts aimed at finding alternative nonhydroxamate ZBGs. We have identified 3-hydroxypyridin-2-thione (3-HPT) as a novel ZBG that is compatible with HDAC inhibition. 3-HPT inhibits HDAC 6 and HDAC 8 with an IC50 of 681 and 3675 nM, respectively. Remarkably, 3-HPT gives no inhibition of HDAC 1. Subsequent optimization led to several novel 3HPT-based HDACi that are selective for HDAC 6 and HDAC 8. Furthermore, a subset of these inhibitors induces apoptosis in various cancer cell lines.
2262902	Central adenosinergic system involvement in ethanol-induced motor incoordination in mice.	To clarify if the behavioral interaction between ethanol and adenosine reported previously occur centrally or due to a peripheral hemodynamic change, the effect of i.c.v. adenosine agonists, N6-(R-phenylisopropyl)adenosine (R-PIA), N6-(S-phenylisopropyl)adenosine, 5'-(N-cyclopropyl)-carboxamidoadenosine, antagonists, theophylline and 8-p-(sulfophenyl)theophylline as well as enprofylline on ethanol-(i.p.)-induced motor incoordination was evaluated by rotorod. Adenosine agonists and antagonists dose dependently accentuated and attenuated, respectively, ethanol-induced motor incoordination, thereby suggesting a central mechanism of adenosine modulation of this effect of ethanol and confirmed our previous reports in which adenosine agonists and antagonists were given i.p. Enprofylline, a weak adenosine antagonist but potent inhibitor of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase, did not alter ethanol's motor incoordination, further supporting involvement of brain adenosine receptor mechanism(s) in ethanol-adenosine interactions. Results from R-PIA and N6-(S-phenylisopropyl)adenosine experiments showed nearly a 40-fold greater potency of R-vs. S-diastereoisomer, suggesting predominance of adenosine A1 subtype. However, 5'-(N-cyclopropyl)-carboxamidoadenosine data indicate complexity of the mechanism(s) and point toward an additional involvement of a yet unknown subtype of adenosine A2. No effect of ethanol on blood or brain levels of [3H]R-PIA was noted and sufficient amount of the latter entered the brain to suggest adenosine receptor activation adequate to produce behavioral interaction with ethanol. There was no escape of i.c.v.-administered [3H]R-PIA from brain to the peripheral circulation ruling out a peripheral and supporting a central mechanism of ethanol-adenosine interaction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
23291264	Urinary chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (monocyte chemotactic protein-1) as a tubular injury marker for early detection of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity.	Because of the difficulty in detecting segment-specific response in the kidney, we investigated the molecular events underlying acute kidney injury in the proximal tubules of rats with cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum II)-induced nephrotoxicity. Microarray analysis revealed that mRNA levels of several cytokines and chemokines, such as interleukin-1beta, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL) 2, CCL20, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand (CXCL) 1, and CXCL10 were significantly increased after cisplatin treatment in both isolated proximal tubules and whole kidney. Interestingly, tubular CCL2 mRNA levels increased soon after cisplatin administration, whereas CCL2 mRNA levels in whole kidney first decreased and then increased. Levels of both CCL2 and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) in the whole kidney increased after cisplatin administration. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed CCL2 changes in the proximal tubular cells initially and then in the medullary interstitium. Urinary CCL2 excretion significantly increased approximately 3-fold compared with controls the day after cisplatin administration (5mg/kg), when no changes were observed plasma creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels. Urinary levels of KIM-1 also increased 3-fold after cisplatin administration. In addition, urinary CCL2 rather than KIM-1 increased in chronic renal failure rats after administration of low-dose cisplatin (2mg/kg), suggesting that urinary CCL2 was selective for cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in renal impairment. These results indicated that the increase in cytokine and chemokine expression in renal epithelial cells might be responsible for kidney deterioration in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, and that urinary CCL2 is associated with tubular injury and serves as a sensitive and noninvasive marker for the early detection of cisplatin-induced tubular injury.
7948825	Sucralfate: the Bangkok review.	Sucralfate is a site-protective ulcer healing drug with a remarkable range of mechanisms of action. Recent studies highlight the capacity of sucralfate to bind basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and deliver it in high concentration to the ulcer. Basic fibroblast growth factor stimulates the production of granulation tissue, angiogenesis and re-epithelization, thus improving the quality of ulcer healing. The effect of sucralfate in reducing parietal cell sensitivity may be another factor important in the lower relapse rate demonstrated after duodenal ulcer healing. Sucralfate has been demonstrated to be efficacious in healing both duodenal and gastric ulcers together with mild oesophagitis, and it is safe for both short-term use and maintenance. In stress ulcer prophylaxis it is as effective as acid suppression or neutralization and has the advantage of lesser rates of nosocomial pneumonia than are demonstrated with antacids or H2 antagonists. The potential advantages of sucralfate lie in the better quality of ulcer healing associated with longer duration of remission.
7742303	Minor groove recognition of the critical acceptor helix base pair by an appended module of a class II tRNA synthetase.	"The class-defining active site domain of the 10 class II tRNA synthetases is well conserved and, based on the crystal structure of aspartyl-tRNA synthetase, approaches the end of the tRNA acceptor stem from the major groove side of the helix. Paradoxically, for the class II alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS), aminoacylation is dependent on minor groove recognition of an acceptor helix G3.U70 base pair. Additional contributions to aminoacylation efficiency are made by the A73 ""discriminator"" base and G2.C71 base pair located at the end of the acceptor stem. Using microhelix substrates containing only the first four base pairs of the alanine tRNA acceptor helix, we demonstrated that the catalytic center of AlaRS with the three class-defining sequence motifs contains determinants for recognition of A73 and G2.C71. However, this structural unit does not discriminate between different base pairs at the critical 3.70 position. Discrimination at G3.U70 was mapped to a 76 amino acid polypeptide outside the catalytic center. We propose that the G3.U70 recognition motif is a structural appendage that folds back to the catalytic center to make contact with the bound acceptor stem. A ""fold-back"" appendage provides a specific mechanism for minor groove recognition of the acceptor helix by a class II tRNA synthetase."
23374865	Synthesis and micellar mimic properties of bile acid trimers.	Two fan-shaped bile acid trimers have been synthesized via Cu(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) 'click chemistry', and their extraction experiments of cresol red sodium (CR) and pyrene were investigated in the polar and non-polar solvents, respectively. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results showed that the homogenous hollow capsules formed with the diameter size range of 40-70 nm in a solution of water and acetone. Thus the amphiphilicity of fan-shaped bile acid trimers might be used as the promising candidate in biological and drug delivery applications.
16532916	Intrauterine pressure, ischemia markers, and experienced pain during administration of a vasopressin V1a receptor antagonist in spontaneous and vasopressin-induced dysmenorrhea.	BACKGROUND: A model to study the effect of vasopressin V1a antagonist in dysmenorrhea. METHODS: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial was performed. Eight patients with primary dysmenorrhea and eight tuballigated, healthy subjects participated on days 1-2 of two consecutive menstruations. At each menstruation a bolus injection of 10 pmol/kg of vasopressin was administered before and during infusion of either 300 microg/min of atosiban or placebo. Intrauterine pressure was measured as area under the curve throughout the experiments. Ischemia markers in plasma and pain recorded by a visual analog scale were measured before and after each vasopressin injection as well as before and after the start of either atosiban or placebo infusion. RESULTS: Vasopressin injections elevated area under the curve in both healthy volunteers and dysmenorrhea subjects. The vasopressin-induced rise in area under the curve was lower during atosiban administration than during infusion of placebo in both groups. None of the ischemia markers differed between or within groups at vasopressin injections or atosiban/placebo infusions. In subjects with dysmenorrhea the increase in pain following the administration of vasopressin was significantly lower during atosiban than during placebo infusion. Healthy volunteers experienced only slight discomfort after the vasopressin injections. CONCLUSIONS: Atosiban reduces vasopressin-induced intrauterine pressure in both healthy volunteers and dysmenorrheics, and reported pain in subjects with dysmenorrhea. The ischemia markers are not a useful biomarker index in women with dysmenorrhea. The dysmenorrhea pain evoked by vasopressin correlated poorly with area under the curve, which may suggest that the effect is mediated by more than one V1a-like receptor. We conclude that this model with recordings in healthy women is useful in the evaluation of drug candidates for primary dysmenorrhea.
16973761	Conserved amino acid residues that are important for ligand binding in the type I gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor are required for high potency of GnRH II at the type II GnRH receptor.	GnRH I regulates reproduction. A second form, designated GnRH II, selectively binds type II GnRH receptors. Amino acids of the type I GnRH receptor required for binding of GnRH I (Asp2.61(98), Asn2.65(102), and Lys3.32(121)) are conserved in the type II GnRH receptor, but their roles in receptor function are unknown. We have delineated their functions using mutagenesis, signaling and binding assays, immunoblotting, and computational modeling. Mutating Asp2.61(97) to Glu or Ala, Asn2.65(101) to Ala, or Lys3.32(120) to Gln decreased potency of GnRH II-stimulated inositol phosphate production. Consistent with proposed roles in ligand recognition, mutations eliminated measurable binding of GnRH II, whereas expression of mutant receptors was not decreased. In detailed analysis of how these residues affect ligand-dependent signaling, [Trp2]-GnRH I showed lesser decreases in potency than GnRH I at the Asp2.61(97)Glu mutant. In contrast, [Trp2]-GnRH II showed the same loss of potency as GnRH II at this mutant. This suggests that Asp2.61(97) contributes to recognition of His2 of GnRH I, but not of GnRH II. GnRH II showed a large decrease in potency at the Asn2.65(101)Ala mutant compared with analogs lacking the CO group of Gly10NH2. This suggests that Asn2.65(101) recognizes Gly10NH2 of GnRH II. GnRH agonists showed large decreases in potency at the Lys3.32(120)Gln mutant, but antagonist activity was unaffected. This suggests that Lys3.32(120) recognizes agonists, but not antagonists, as in the type I receptor. These data indicate that roles of conserved residues are similar, but not identical, in the type I and II GnRH receptors.
16740637	Compensatory responses to pyruvate carboxylase suppression in islet beta-cells. Preservation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.	We have previously reported that glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) is tightly correlated with pyruvate carboxylase (PC)-catalyzed anaplerotic flux into the tricarboxylic acid cycle and stimulation of pyruvate cycling activity. To further evaluate the role of PC in beta-cell function, we constructed a recombinant adenovirus containing a small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific to PC (Ad-siPC). Ad-siPC reduced PC mRNA levels by 83 and 64% and PC protein by 56 and 35% in INS-1-derived 832/13 cells and primary rat islets, respectively. Surprisingly, this manipulation did not impair GSIS in rat islets. In Ad-siPC-treated 832/13 cells, GSIS was slightly increased, whereas glycolytic rate and glucose oxidation were unaffected. Flux through PC at high glucose was decreased by only 20%, suggesting an increase in PC-specific activity. Acetyl carnitine, a surrogate for acetyl-CoA, an allosteric activator of PC, was increased by 36% in Ad-siPC-treated cells, suggesting a mechanism by which PC enzymatic activity is maintained with suppressed PC protein levels. In addition, the NADPH:NADP ratio, a proposed coupling factor for GSIS, was unaffected in Ad-siPC-treated cells. We conclude that beta-cells activate compensatory mechanisms in response to suppression of PC expression that prevent impairment of anaplerosis, pyruvate cycling, NAPDH production, and GSIS.
23576175	Attenuation of Gouty Arthritis by Emodinol in Monosodium Urate Crystal-Treated Mice.	A series of studies have recently demonstrated that the release of interleukin 1β induced by monosodium urate crystals is central to the experimental gouty arthritis. Elaeagnus pungens has been traditionally used for the treatment of gouty arthritis in China for more than thousands years. However, there is still little known about the active ingredients and mechanisms of E. pungens against gouty arthritis. Emodinol, as a major triterpene compound in E. pungens, has been seldom reported to have an effect on gouty arthritis. Therefore, the potential beneficial effects and mechanisms of emodinol on gouty arthritis were investigated in this study. Results showed that it significantly ameliorated the hyperalgesia, inflammation, and levels of multiple proinflammatory cytokines in monosodium urate crystals-treated mice. These findings elucidate that emodinol exhibits a prominent effect on improving symptoms of acute gouty arthritis induced by monosodium urate crystals through inhibiting the generation of proinflammatory cytokines.
17053736	[Efalizumab].	Efalizumab (Raptiva, Serono) is a humanised monoclonal antibody (IgG1) produced by biotechnology. This antibody has a novel place among biotherapies for psoriasis. It is bound to the CD11a subunit of a surface molecule of the T lymphocyte LFA-1 (Leucocyte Function-associated Antigen-1). This molecule is essential for binding of T lymphocytes to the ICAM-1 molecule (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1) found on antigen-presenting cells, endothelial cells and keratinocytes. Binding of efalizumab to CD11a prevents binding of LFA-1 to ICAM-1, thus inhibiting several steps in the immunological process responsible for formation of psoriatic plaque (activation of naive T lymphocytes to memory T lymphocytes, lymphocyte migration and reactivation of T lymphocytes in skin). Efalizumab was approved in the United States by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) in 2003 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis requiring systemic therapy. It may be used as first-line therapy in the United States in this indication. In France, marketing authorisation (MA) was granted more recently in September 2005. The indications are moderate-to-severe cutaneous plaque psoriasis in adults in cases of failure, intolerance or contraindication of at least two systemic treatments including phototherapy, methotrexate and cyclosporine. Current clinical trial data is available for 3500 patients with plaque psoriasis. A 75% improvement in PASI score was seen in between 22 and 39% of patients treated with efalizumab (vs. 2 to 5% for patients on placebo) in a single weekly subcutaneous injection (1 mg/kg). A study in good responders confirms the continuing long-term efficacy of prescription of the drug up to 36 months (with at least a 75% improvement in PASI score in 53% of patients). However, it is not effective against joint involvement in psoriasis. The most common side-effects (incidence >1/100) are influenza-like syndrome, risk of outbreak of cutaneous psoriasis during or after discontinuation of treatment, worsening of arthralgia, minor hypersensitivity reactions, reversible changes in laboratory values (hyperlymphocytosis, elevated alkaline phosphatases and transaminases). Because of rare cases of thrombocytopenia (incidence<1/100), reversible on discontinuation of treatment, monthly monitoring of platelet counts is required over the first 3 months of therapy. There are currently no randomised studies comparing the various systemic treatments (standard therapy and biotherapy) for psoriasis. However, on extrapolation of the available results concerning efficacy (PASI-75 after 12 weeks of treatment), efalizumab appears to be less efficacious than anti-TNF alpha agents. This drug constitutes an additional treatment option and its position in the therapeutic arsenal will depend upon its long-term benefit/risk ratio in relation to other biotherapies.
23432586	Immunophilins are Involved in the Altered Platelet Aggregation Observed in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.	Platelet hyperaggregability might contribute to vascular complications associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2).Experimental evidence supports a direct link between altered Ca2+ entry and hyperaggregability in DM2 patients. Objectives: We aimed to investigate whether altered immunophilin expression and function are involved in the abnormal Ca2+ entry observed in platelets from DM2 patients. Results: Inhibition of immunophilins by tacrolimus (FK506) and sirolimus (rapamycin) reduced Ca2+ entry in platelets from healthy donors and DM2 patients. Similarly, immunophilin inhibitors reduced platelet degranulation in both healthy and DM2 subjects. Nevertheless, α-granule secretion reduction was greater than that observed for dense granules in platelets from DM2 patients. However, no difference was observed in the inhibition of secretion in platelets from healthy subjects. Additionally, altered expression of FK506 binding protein-52 (FKBP52) and coupling to Ca(2+) channels were found in platelets from DM2 patients compared to healthy subjects. Finally, reduction in platelet function from healthy subjects and DM2 patients in the presence of immunophilin antagonists was observed, being this dysfunction more evident in platelets from DM2 patients. Conclusions: We suggest that, among others, FKBP52 expression and function are altered in platelets from DM2 patients, contributing to the altered Ca(2+) entry and hyperaggregability in these cells.
6362415	Indirect immunofluorescence studies on the steroid-producing activity of hamster ova.	Steroidogenesis in the unfertilized hamster ova was investigated by indirect immunofluorescence study. delta 5-3 beta-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (delta 5-3 beta-HSD) activity was found in hamster follicular and ovulatory ova with pregnenolone used as the substrate. A significant quantity of 17 beta-estradiol was detected in the ooplasm of follicular and ovulatory ova. No progesterone was found. The activity of delta 5-3 beta-HSD in follicular and ovulatory ova was inhibited by preincubation with 10 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in 1 ml of phosphate buffer solution. Trilostane, a potent new inhibitor of the delta 5-3 beta-HSD system, was found to inhibit the activity of delta 5-3 beta-HSD in ovulatory ova in 1 ml of phosphate buffer solution at a concentration of 10(-7)M. After these results were obtained, steroidogenesis of hamster ova was suggested in an indirect immunofluorescence study, and the implications of steroidogenesis for oocyte maturation and subsequent fertilization are discussed.
15169637	Acetazolamide inhibits aquaporin-1 protein expression and angiogenesis.	AIM: To study effects of acetazolamide on aquaporin-1 (AQP(1)) protein expression and angiogenesis. METHODS: Establishing Lewis-lung-carcinoma model, the localization of AQP(1) in tumor tissues was investigated by immunohistochemical methods; The biological activity of acetazolamide was detected by endothelial cells proliferation test (MTT) assay and chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) vascular inhibition test. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical localization of AQP(1) in mice tumor was labeled in capillaries, post capillary venules endothelial cells. After being treated with acetazolamide, the number of capillaries and post capillary venules was significantly decreased in tumor tissue. Acetazolamide showed significant inhibitory effect on angiogenesis in CAM and endothelial cell proliferation. CONCLUSION: Acetazolamide might be identified and developed as one of potential lead compounds for a new therapeutic intervention in inhibiting cancer angiogenesis.
17664022	Pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms in the clonidine- and oxymetazoline-induced inhibition of gastric motility in the rat.	The inhibitory effect of clonidine (non-selective alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist) and oxymetazoline (alpha2A-adrenoceptor selective agonist) was compared on basal and stimulated gastric motor activity (gastric tone and contractions) using the balloon method in the rat. It was shown that oxymetazoline (0.2-1.7 micromol/kg, i.v.) decreased the basal motility, while clonidine (1.9-3.8 micromol/kg, i.v.) failed to affect it. When motility was stimulated centrally by insulin (5 IU/rat, i.v.), both clonidine (1.9-3.8 micromol/kg, i.v.) and oxymetazoline (0.1-3.4 micromol/kg, i.v.) inhibited the gastric motor activity. However, while the effect of clonidine was antagonized by the non-selective alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine (5 micromol/kg, i.v.) and the alpha2A-adrenoceptor selective antagonist BRL 44408 (3 micromol/kg, i.v.), the effect of oxymetazoline was only partially affected. Prazosin (alpha1- and alpha2B-adrenoceptor antagonist, 0.07-0.28 micromol/kg, i.v.) also failed to reverse the effect of oxymetazoline. Furthermore, when gastric motility was stimulated peripherally by activation of postsynaptic cholinergic muscarinic receptors by the combination of carbachol (0.14 micromol/kg, i.v.) and hexamethonium (37 micromol/kg, i.v.), clonidine (3.8 micromol/kg, i.v.) failed to affect the increased motor activity, however, oxymetazoline (0.8-3.4 micromol/kg, i.v.) exerted a pronounced inhibition. These results suggest that different mechanisms may be involved in the inhibitory effect of clonidine and oxymetazoline; while clonidine reduces the gastric motility by activation of presynaptic alpha2-adrenoceptors, postsynaptic component in the effect of oxymetazoline has also been raised.
12871155	Recent developments in the synthesis of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.	The acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibitory activities of a series of pyrano[2,3-b]quinolines (2, 3), [1,8]naphthyridines (5, 6), 4-amino-2,3-diaryl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofuro[2,3-b]quinolines (11-13)/ 4-amino-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-2,3-diphenyl-5H-cyclohepta[e]furo[2,3-b]pyridine (14), 4-amino-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2,3-diphenylthieno[2,3-b]quinoline (15)/ 4-amino-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-2,3-diphenyl-5H-cyclohepta[e]thieno[2,3-b]pyridine (16) are described. These compounds are tacrine analogues that have been prepared from readily available polyfunctionalized ethyl [6-amino-5-cyano-4H-pyran]-3-carboxylates (9, 10), ethyl [6-amino-5-cyanopyridine]-3-carboxylates (7, 8), 2-amino-3-cyano-4,5-diarylfurans (17-19) and 2-amino-3-cyano-4,5-diphenylthiophene (20) via Friedlander condensation with selected ketones. These compounds are competitive and, in a few cases, non-competitive inhibitors for AChE, the most potent being compound (14), though three-fold less active than tacrine. The BuChE inhibitory activity is only significant in compounds 11 and 14, ten-fold less active than tacrine. Furthermore, the products 12 and 13 are selective and moderate AChE inhibitors.
23169610	The role of cytochrome P450-dependent metabolism in the regulation of mouse hepatic growth hormone signaling components and target genes by 3-methylcholanthrene.	3-Methylcholanthrene (MC) is a readily metabolized aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) agonist. MC disrupts expression of mouse hepatic growth hormone (GH) signaling components and suppresses cytochrome P450 2D9 (Cyp2d9), a male-specific gene controlled by pulsatile GH via signal transducer and activator of transcription 5b (STAT5b). To determine if these effects of MC depend on hepatic microsomal P450-mediated activity, we examined biologic responses to MC treatment in liver Cpr-null (LCN) mice with hepatocyte-specific conditional deletion of NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR). MC caused mild induction of Por and a hepatic inflammatory marker in wild-type mice, whereas MC caused strong induction of AHR target genes, Cyp1a1, Cyp1a2, and Cyp1b1 in wild-type and LCN mice. Two mouse hepatic STAT5b target genes, Cyp2d9 and major urinary protein 2 (Mup2), were suppressed by MC in wild-type mice, and the CYP2D9 mRNA response was maintained in LCN mice. In wild-type mice only, MC decreased hepatic GH receptor (GHR) mRNA but increased GHR protein levels. There was an apparent impairment of STAT5 phosphorylation by MC in wild-type and LCN mice, but large interanimal variation prevented achievement of statistical significance. In vehicle-treated mice, basal levels of MUP2 mRNA, GHR mRNA, GHR protein, and the activation status of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 and Akt were influenced by hepatic Por genetic status. These results indicate that the effects of MC on hepatic GH signaling components and target genes are complex, involving aspects that are both dependent and independent of hepatic microsomal P450-mediated activity.
8425287	Response of nonreentrant catecholamine-mediated ventricular tachycardia to endogenous adenosine and acetylcholine. Evidence for myocardial receptor-mediated effects.	BACKGROUND: Reentrant ventricular tachycardia (VT) is known to be insensitive to the nucleoside adenosine. However, we have previously identified a form of nonreentrant, catecholamine-mediated VT that can be initiated with rapid pacing, demonstrates cycle length dependence, and is sensitive to exogenous adenosine as well as to the Valsalva maneuver. The mechanism of this tachycardia is thought to be due to a catecholamine-induced, cAMP-mediated increase in intracellular calcium, resulting in delayed afterdepolarizations and triggered activity. The antiarrhythmic effects of exogenous adenosine and Valsalva on this form of VT may be due to receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase or to noncardiac receptor-mediated effects, i.e., exogenous adenosine may modulate VT through alterations in autonomic tone by activation of arterial chemoreceptors, and Valsalva has been shown to decrease venous return, resulting in a reduction in cardiac dimensions and myocardial stretch. To clarify this issue and circumvent both autonomic and noncardiac receptor effects, the response of nonreentrant catecholamine-mediated VT to endogenous adenosine and acetylcholine was evaluated. METHODS AND RESULTS: Group 1 (n = 8): Dipyridamole (0.56 mg/kg i.v.), a nucleoside transport blocker that potentiates the effects of endogenous adenosine, reproducibly abolished sustained nonreentrant, nonautomatic, catecholamine-mediated VT in the five patients in whom it was evaluated. VT recurred with the addition of aminophylline, a competitive adenosine A1-receptor antagonist. Edrophonium (10 mg i.v.), a cholinesterase inhibitor that potentiates the effects of acetylcholine at the muscarinic cholinergic receptor, terminated VT in four of four patients, an effect that was reversed by atropine. Group 2 (n = 6): In patients with reentrant VT, dipyridamole and edrophonium had no effect on VT cycle length or duration. Group 3 (n = 4): Adenosine and vagal maneuvers had no effect on catecholamine-mediated VT caused by automaticity in three of four patients tested. In one patient, adenosine transiently suppressed VT (< 5 seconds), after which it spontaneously resumed. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study further delineate the mechanism of a newly recognized form of clinical VT. It can be identified by termination of the tachycardia in response to activation of the adenosine A1 or muscarinic cholinergic receptor, which results in inhibition of adenylate cyclase. These receptor-mediated effects appear to be specific for identifying nonreentrant, nonautomatic, catecholamine-mediated VT.
16291873	Drug binding interactions in the inner cavity of HERG channels: molecular insights from structure-activity relationships of clofilium and ibutilide analogs.	Block of human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) K(+) channels by otherwise useful drugs is the most common cause of long QT syndrome, a disorder of cardiac repolarization that predisposes patients to potentially fatal arrhythmias. This undesirable long QT side effect has been a major reason for the withdrawal of medications from the pharmaceutical market. Understanding the molecular basis of hERG block is therefore essential to facilitate the design of safe drugs. Binding sites for hERG blockers have been mapped within the inner cavity of the channel and include aromatic residues in the S6 helix (Tyr-652, Phe-656) and residues in the pore helix (Thr-623, Ser-624, Val-625). We used mutagenesis of these residues, combined with an investigation of hERG block by close analogs of clofilium and ibutilide, to assess how specific alterations in drug structure affected potency and binding interactions. Although changing the basic nitrogen from quaternary to tertiary accelerated the onset of block, the IC(50) and kinetics for recovery from block were similar. In contrast, analogs with different para-substituents on the phenyl ring had significantly different potencies for wild-type hERG block. The highest potency was achieved with polar or electronegative para-substituents, whereas neutral para-substituents had potencies more than 100-fold lower. Results from mutagenesis and molecular modeling studies suggest that phenyl ring para-substituents influence drug interactions with Thr-623, Ser-624, and Tyr-652 and strongly affect binding affinity. Together, these findings suggest that modifying the para-substituent could be a useful strategy for reducing hERG potency and increasing the safety margin of compounds in development.
23354070	Evidence for a new binding mode to GSK-3: allosteric regulation by the marine compound palinurin.	Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) is widely recognised as a relevant player in the pathogenesis of several highly prevalent disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, mood disorders, diabetes and cancer. Therefore, this enzyme constitutes a highly attractive therapeutic target for the development of selective inhibitors as new promising drugs for the treatment of these pathologies. We describe here the isolation and biochemical characterization of the marine natural sesquiterpene palinurin as a GSK-3β inhibitor. Experimental studies performed for characterizing the inhibitory mechanism indicate that GSK-3β inhibition by palinurin cannot be competed out by ATP nor peptide substrate. Molecular modelling techniques have enabled us to propose an unconventional binding mode to GSK-3β. Moreover, molecular dynamics simulations have identified an allosteric mechanism by which binding of palinurin leads to GSK-3β inhibition. The inhibitory activities determined for a series of structurally related analogues support the proposed binding mode of palinurin, which is the first compound described to target this allosteric site. The results offer new opportunities for designing and developing selective inhibitors with novel mechanisms of action.
22796428	A selective dopamine reuptake inhibitor improves prefrontal cortex-dependent cognitive function: potential relevance to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.	Drugs used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) improve prefrontal cortex (PFC)-dependent cognitive function. The majority of ADHD-related treatments act either as dual norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) reuptake inhibitors (psychostimulants) or selective NE reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Certain benztropine analogs act as highly selective DA reuptake inhibitors while lacking the reinforcing actions, and thus abuse potential, of psychostimulants. To assess the potential use of these compounds in the treatment of ADHD, we examined the effects of a well-characterized benztropine analog, AHN 2-005, on performance of rats in a PFC-dependent delayed-alternation task of spatial working memory. Similar to that seen with all drugs currently approved for ADHD, AHN 2-005 dose-dependently improved performance in this task. Clinically-relevant doses of psychostimulants and SNRIs elevate NE and DA preferentially in the PFC. Despite the selectivity of this compound for the DA transporter, additional microdialysis studies demonstrated that a cognition-enhancing dose of AHN 2-005 that lacked locomotor activating effects increased extracellular levels of both DA and NE in the PFC. AHN 2-005 produced a larger increase in extracellular DA in the nucleus accumbens, although the magnitude of this was well below that seen with motor activating doses of psychostimulants. Collectively, these observations suggest that benztropine analogs may be efficacious in the treatment of ADHD or other disorders associated with PFC dysfunction. These studies provide a strong rationale for future research focused on the neural mechanisms contributing to the cognition-enhancing actions and the potential clinical utility of AHN 2-005 and related compounds. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Cognitive Enhancers'.
23178182	UCCB01-125, a dimeric inhibitor of PSD-95, reduces inflammatory pain without disrupting cognitive or motor performance: comparison with the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801.	Excessive N-Methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent production of nitric oxide (NO) is involved in the development and maintenance of chronic pain states, and is mediated by postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95). By binding to both the NMDAR and neuronal NO synthase (nNOS), PSD-95 mediates a specific coupling between NMDAR activation and NO production. NMDAR antagonism shows anti-nociceptive action in humans and animal models of chronic pain but is associated with severe disturbances of cognitive and motor functions. An alternative approach to modulate the NMDAR-related activity is to perturb the NMDAR/PSD-95/nNOS complex by targeting PSD-95, thereby decreasing NO production without interfering with the NMDAR ion channel function. Here, we compared the effects of a dimeric PSD-95 inhibitor, UCCB01-125, and the NMDAR antagonist, MK-801, on mechanical hypersensitivity in the complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) model of inflammatory pain. To examine side-effect profiles we also compared the effects of UCCB01-125 and MK-801 in tests of attention, long-term memory, and motor performance. When administered concurrently with CFA, both MK-801 and UCCB01-125 prevented the development of CFA-induced mechanical hypersensitivity 1 and 24 h after treatment. Moreover, UCCB01-125 was found to reverse CFA-induced hypersensitivity when administered 24 h after CFA treatment, an effect lasting for at least 3 days. At the dose reducing hypersensitivity, MK-801 disrupted attention, long-term memory, and motor performance. By contrast, even high doses of UCCB01-125 were devoid of side-effects in these tests. The data suggest that PSD-95 inhibition is a feasible strategy to prevent both development and maintenance of chronic inflammatory pain, while avoiding NMDAR antagonism-related side-effects.
20151846	Fulvestrant: a unique antiendocrine agent for estrogen-sensitive breast cancer.	IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: The role of estrogen deprivation for the treatment of breast cancer has been understood since the 1800s. Pharmacologic advances in the field in the past decades, including tamoxifen and the aromatase inhibitors, have contributed significantly to the reduced mortality of estrogen-sensitive breast cancer. However, this subtype of breast cancer still presents with relapses and, once metastatic, progression to hormone-refractory state and loss of disease control remain an expected disease course. Fulvestrant, a pure estrogen receptor downregulator, is a new addition to the antiestrogen therapeutic armamentarium since its FDA approval in 2002. Its unique mechanism of action offers potential advantages over other estrogen targeted therapies. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: Published scientific literature, including presented abstracts, on fulvestrant from 1985 to the present were reviewed with selected publications included. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: This review addresses current issues and therapies for estrogen-sensitive breast cancer, highlights the role of fulvestrant in current treatment guidelines and outlines some of the ongoing investigations of this compound. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Fulvestrant is an effective and well-tolerated drug for treatment of metastatic estrogen-sensitive breast cancer. Work is underway to enhance its clinical benefit to patients as a single agent and in combination with other therapies.
9387868	Serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine transporter mRNAs: heterogeneity of distribution and response to 'binge' cocaine administration.	Quantitative in situ hybridization was utilized to map the distribution and abundance of the serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine transporter (SERT, DAT and NET, respectively) mRNAs. SERT mRNA was quantified within the dorsal raphe (DR) and the median raphe (MR), DAT mRNA within the ventral tegmental area -substantia nigra (VTA-SN) region and NET mRNA within the locus coeruleus (LC). SERT mRNA expression within the raphe complex was organized into distinct subregional domains with the rank order of mRNA abundance: ventromedial (vm) DR > dorsomedial (dm) DR > MR > dorsolateral (dl) DR. The relative abundance of DAT mRNA also varied across subregions: SN pars compacta > the parabrachial pigmentosis (PBP) > the intrafascicular (IF). The effects of a 'binge' paradigm of cocaine administration on SERT, DAT and NET mRNA abundance were compared in the brains of behaviorally sensitized rats. Cocaine significantly decreased the abundance of the SERT mRNA within the dlDR and DAT mRNA abundance within the SNc and the PBP, and increased the abundance of the NET mRNA within the LC. Finally, correlational analysis indicated that post-cocaine levels of DAT, SERT and NET mRNAs were not associated with cocaine-induced sensitization.
22541068	Classification of inhibitors of hepatic organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs): influence of protein expression on drug-drug interactions.	The hepatic organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) influence the pharmacokinetics of several drug classes and are involved in many clinical drug-drug interactions. Predicting potential interactions with OATPs is, therefore, of value. Here, we developed in vitro and in silico models for identification and prediction of specific and general inhibitors of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OATP2B1. The maximal transport activity (MTA) of each OATP in human liver was predicted from transport kinetics and protein quantification. We then used MTA to predict the effects of a subset of inhibitors on atorvastatin uptake in vivo. Using a data set of 225 drug-like compounds, 91 OATP inhibitors were identified. In silico models indicated that lipophilicity and polar surface area are key molecular features of OATP inhibition. MTA predictions identified OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 as major determinants of atorvastatin uptake in vivo. The relative contributions to overall hepatic uptake varied with isoform specificities of the inhibitors.
23537942	Anticancer activity of novel hybrid molecules containing 5-benzylidene thiazolidine-2,4-dione.	Hybridization of two different bioactive molecules with different mechanism of action is one of the methods that are being adopted to treat cancer. Molecules bearing a thiazolidine-2,4-dione scaffold have been recognized as antineoplastic agents with a broad spectrum of activity against many cancer cell lines. In this manuscript we have described the synthesis and biological evaluation of two series of N-3-substituted-5-arylidene thiazolidine-2,4-diones, bearing the α-bromoacryloylamido moiety at the para- or meta-position on the phenyl of the arylidene portion. We have observed that selected compounds 5a, 5c and 5g suppress proliferation of human myeloid leukaemia HL-60 and U937 cells by triggering morphological changes and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, which are well-known features of apoptosis. Finally, our results indicated that the investigated compounds induced apoptotic cell death through a mechanism that involved activation of multiple caspases and was also associated with the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria.
23439383	Long-term potentiation: Peeling the onion.	Since the discovery of long-term potentiation (LTP), thousands of papers have been published on this phenomenon. With this massive amount of information, it is often difficult, especially for someone not directly involved in the field, not to be overwhelmed. The goal of this review is to peel away as many layers as possible, and probe the core properties of LTP. We would argue that the many dozens of proteins that have been implicated in the phenomenon are not essential, but rather modulate, often in indirect ways, the threshold and/or magnitude of LTP. What is required is NMDA receptor activation followed by CaMKII activation. The consequence of CaMKII activation is the rapid recruitment of AMPA receptors to the synapse. This recruitment is independent of AMPA receptor subunit type, but absolutely requires an adequate pool of surface receptors. An important unresolved issue is how exactly CaMKII activation leads to modifications in the PSD to allow rapid enrichment. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'GluR-dep synaptic plasticity'.
10418858	Insulin resistance and thrombosis: a cardiologist's view.	Atherogenesis in the vasculature is accelerated by changes in the dynamic equilibrium between endogenous tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). Increased expression of PAI-1, decreased expression of tissue plasminogen activator, or both can lead to decreased fibrinolytic activity and predispose to thrombosis. Increased concentrations of insulin (and proinsulin) in the plasma increase plasma PAI-1, although the mechanisms of this effect are not known. In addition, it has been observed that basal fibrinolytic activity is decreased in patients with type 2 diabetes; this may accelerate atherosclerosis by exposing vascular luminal wall surfaces to persistent and recurrent thrombi. Abnormalities in the vessel wall appear to contribute to the increased risk. There is also evidence that PAI-1 content is increased in atherosclerotic lesions of patients with type 2 diabetes, suggesting that interventions to reduce insulin resistance and improve glycemic control may improve the fibrinolytic response. Clinical studies in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (characterized by insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, ovarian androgen overproduction, and impaired fibrinolytic capacity) demonstrated that treatment with troglitazone, an insulin-sensitizing agent, can markedly reduce blood levels of PAI-1. There is also clinical evidence that these agents may contribute to regression of intimal medial thickness in patients with type 2 diabetes, providing further indication that antidiabetic interventions may help inhibit the progression of early atherosclerotic lesions.
23591111	A cyclodextrin-capped histone deacetylase inhibitor.	"We have synthesized a β-cyclodextrin (βCD)-capped histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor 3 containing an alkyl linker and a zinc-binding hydroxamic acid motif. Biological evaluation (HDAC inhibition studies) of 3 enabled us to establish the effect of replacing an aryl cap (in SAHA (vorinostat,)) 1 by a large saccharidic scaffold ""cap"". HDAC inhibition was observed for 3, to a lesser extent than SAHA, and rationalized by molecular docking into the active site of HDAC8. However, compound 3 displayed no cellular activity."
23557687	Global gene expression analysis reveals pathway differences between teratogenic and non-teratogenic exposure concentrations of bisphenol A and 17β-estradiol in embryonic zebrafish.	Transient developmental exposure to 0.1μM bisphenol A (BPA) results in larval zebrafish hyperactivity and learning impairments in the adult, while exposure to 80μM BPA results in teratogenic responses, including craniofacial abnormalities and edema. The mode of action underlying these effects is unclear. We used global gene expression analysis to identify candidate genes and signaling pathways that mediate BPA's developmental toxicity in zebrafish. Exposure concentrations were selected and anchored to the positive control, 17β-estradiol (E2), based on previously determined behavioral or teratogenic phenotypes. Functional analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed distinct expression profiles at 24h post fertilization for 0.1μM versus 80μM BPA and 0.1μM versus 15μM E2 exposure, identification of prothrombin activation as a top canonical pathway impacted by both 0.1μM BPA and 0.1μM E2 exposure, and suppressed expression of several genes involved in nervous system development and function following 0.1μM BPA exposure.
23624352	Pullulan-based nanoparticles as carriers for transmucosal protein delivery.	Polymeric nanoparticles have revealed very effective in transmucosal delivery of proteins. Polysaccharides are among the most used materials for the production of these carriers, owing to their structural flexibility and propensity to evidence biocompatibility and biodegradability. In parallel, there is a preference for the use of mild methods for their production, in order to prevent protein degradation, ensure lower costs and easier procedures that enable scaling up. In this work we propose the production of pullulan-based nanoparticles by a mild method of polyelectrolyte complexation. As pullulan is a neutral polysaccharide, sulfated and aminated derivatives of the polymer were synthesized to provide pullulan with a charge. These derivatives were then complexed with chitosan and carrageenan, respectively, to produce the nanocarriers. Positively charged nanoparticles of 180-270nm were obtained, evidencing ability to associate bovine serum albumin, which was selected as model protein. In PBS pH 7.4, pullulan-based nanoparticles were found to have a burst release of 30% of the protein, which maintained up to 24h. Nanoparticle size and zeta potential were preserved upon freeze-drying in the presence of appropriate cryoprotectants. A factorial design was approached to assess the cytotoxicity of raw materials and nanoparticles by the metabolic test MTT. Nanoparticles demonstrated to not cause overt toxicity in a respiratory cell model (Calu-3). Pullulan has, thus, demonstrated to hold potential for the production of nanoparticles with an application in protein delivery.
16860312	Suppression of ischemia/reperfusion liver injury by histamine H4 receptor stimulation in rats.	Inflammatory reactions play an important role in ischemia/reperfusion injury in various organs. Since histamine is closely related to inflammatory reactions and immune responses, effects of postischemic administration of histaminergic ligands on ischemia-induced liver injury were examined in rats. Animals were subjected to warm ischemia for 30 min by occlusion of the left portal vein and hepatic artery under halothane anesthesia, and liver damage was evaluated by assessing plasma concentrations of transaminases after 24 h. Warm ischemia for 30 min provoked severe liver damage after 24 h, and the plasma concentrations of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) were 8600 I.U./l and 13100 I.U./l, respectively. Subcutaneous injections of histamine twice, immediately and 6 h after reperfusion (20 mg/kg, each), alleviated liver damage. The plasma concentrations of ALT and AST in the histamine group were 35% and 24% of those in the control group, respectively. Neither mepyramine (3 mg/kg x 2), an H1 antagonist, nor cimetidine (15 mg/kg x 2), an H2 antagonist, affected the outcome in histamine-treated rats. However, thioperamide (5 mg/kg x 2), an H3/H4 antagonist, completely abolished the alleviation caused by histamine. Administration of dimaprit (1-10 mg/kg x 2), an H2/H4 agonist, mimicked the protective effect of histamine, and the effect of dimaprit is reversed by thioperamide, whereas neither H1 nor H2 antagonists altered the outcome caused by dimaprit. Clozapine (15 mg/kg x 2), an H4 agonist, also mimicked the protective effect of histamine. These findings indicate that stimulation of histamine H4 receptors after ischemic events prevents development of reperfusion injury in the liver.
14976318	Niemann-Pick C1 Like 1 protein is critical for intestinal cholesterol absorption.	Dietary cholesterol consumption and intestinal cholesterol absorption contribute to plasma cholesterol levels, a risk factor for coronary heart disease. The molecular mechanism of sterol uptake from the lumen of the small intestine is poorly defined. We show that Niemann-Pick C1 Like 1(NPC1L1) protein plays a critical role in the absorption of intestinal cholesterol. NPC1L1 expression is enriched in the small intestine and is in the brush border membrane of enterocytes. Although otherwise phenotypically normal, NPC1L1-deficient mice exhibit a substantial reduction in absorbed cholesterol, which is unaffected by dietary supplementation of bile acids. Ezetimibe, a drug that inhibits cholesterol absorption, had no effect in NPC1L1 knockout mice, suggesting that NPC1L1 resides in an ezetimibe-sensitive pathway responsible for intestinal cholesterol absorption.
2882965	Inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism in human neutrophils by sulfasalazine and 5-aminosalicylic acid.	The possible effect of sulfasalazine, 5-aminosalicylic acid, and acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid on endogenous arachidonic acid release and metabolism was studied in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). A new in vitro assay was used by which [1-14C]arachidonic acid is incorporated by purified peripheral PMNs until steady state was obtained (5 hr). After preincubation with the test drugs prior to activation with calcium ionophore A23187, the released eicosanoids were isolated by extraction and thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and quantitated by autoradiography and laser densitometry. Median drug concentrations needed for 50% inhibition of leukotriene B4 and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) release was 4-5 mM (range 1-9 mM) for both sulfasalazine and 5-aminosalicylic acid. The acetylated derivative of 5-aminosalicylic acid was ineffective. The present data suggest that inhibition of arachidonic acid lipoxygenation may be an essential action of sulfasalazine and its active metabolite, 5-aminosalicylic acid. Interference with lipoxygenase enzymes, rather than a steroid-like inhibition of arachidonic acid release from intracellular phospholipids, seems to be the mode of action.
23466232	A new series of N2-substituted-5-(p-toluenesulfonylamino)phthalimide analogues as α-glucosidase inhibitors.	Several members of a new family of non-sugar-type α-glycosidase inhibitors, bearing a 5-(p-toluenesulfonylamino)phthalimide moiety and various substituent at the N2 position, were synthesized and their activities were investigated. The newly synthesized compounds displayed different inhibition profile towards yeast α-glycosidase and rat intestinal α-glycosidase. Almost all the compounds had strong inhibitory activities against yeast α-glycosidase. Regarding rat intestinal α-glycosidase, only analogs with N2-aromatic substituents displayed varying degrees of inhibitory activities on rat intestinal maltase and lactase and nearly all compounds showed no inhibition against rat intestinal α-amylase. Structure-activity relationship studies indicated that 5-(p-toluenesulfonylamino)phthalimide moiety is a favorable scaffold to exert the α-glucosidase inhibitory activity and substituents at the N2 position have considerable influence on the efficacy of the inhibition activities.
23319591	Methylation of histone H3 on lysine 4 by the lysine methyltransferase SET1 protein is needed for normal clock gene expression.	The circadian oscillator controls time-of-day gene expression by a network of interconnected feedback loops and is reset by light. The requisite for chromatin regulation in eukaryotic transcription necessitates temporal regulation of histone-modifying and chromatin-remodeling enzymes for proper clock function. CHD1 is known to bind H3K4me3 in mammalian cells, and Neurospora CHD1 is required for proper regulation of the frequency (frq) gene. Based on this, we examined a strain lacking SET1 to determine the role of H3K4 methylation in clock- and light-mediated frq regulation. Expression of frq was altered in strains lacking set1 under both circadian- and light-regulated gene expression. There is a delay in the phasing of H3K4me3 relative to the peak in frq expression. White Collar 2 (WC-2) association with the frq promoter persists longer in Δset1, suggesting a more permissible chromatin state. Surprisingly, SET1 is required for DNA methylation in the frq promoter, indicating a dependence on H3K4me for DNA methylation. The data support a model where SET1 is needed for proper regulation by modulating chromatin at frq.
7567987	Aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase, a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme, is a beta-cell autoantigen.	Different autoantigens are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and they may account for the variation in the clinical presentation of the disease. Sera from patients with autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type I contain autoantibodies against the beta-cell proteins glutamate decarboxylase and an unrelated 51-kDa antigen. By screening of an expression library derived from rat insulinoma cells, we have identified the 51-kDa protein as aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.28). In addition to the previously published full-length cDNA, forms coding for a truncated and an alternatively spliced version were identified. Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase catalyzes the decarboxylation of L-5-hydroxytryptophan to serotonin and that of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine to dopamine. Interestingly, pyridoxal phosphate is the cofactor of both aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase and glutamate decarboxylase. The biological significance of the neurotransmitters produced by the two enzymes in the beta cells remains largely unknown.
23273895	Nanodomain coupling at an excitatory cortical synapse.	The coupling distance between presynaptic Ca(2+) influx and the sensor for vesicular transmitter release determines speed and reliability of synaptic transmission. Nanodomain coupling (<100 nm) favors fidelity and is employed by synapses specialized for escape reflexes and by inhibitory synapses involved in synchronizing fast network oscillations. Cortical glutamatergic synapses seem to forgo the benefits of tight coupling, yet quantitative detail is lacking. The reduced transmission fidelity of loose coupling, however, raises the question whether it is indeed a general characteristic of cortical synapses. Here we analyzed excitatory parallel fiber to Purkinje cell synapses, major processing sites for sensory information and well suited for analysis because they typically harbor only a single active zone. We quantified the coupling distance by combining multiprobability fluctuation analyses, presynaptic Ca(2+) imaging, and reaction-diffusion simulations in wild-type and calretinin-deficient mice. We found a coupling distance of <30 nm at these synapses, much shorter than at any other glutamatergic cortical synapse investigated to date. Our results suggest that nanodomain coupling is a general characteristic of conventional cortical synapses involved in high-frequency transmission, allowing for dense gray matter packing and cost-effective neurotransmission.
17632548	Crystal structure of a human membrane protein involved in cysteinyl leukotriene biosynthesis.	The cysteinyl leukotrienes, namely leukotriene (LT)C4 and its metabolites LTD4 and LTE4, the components of slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis, are lipid mediators of smooth muscle constriction and inflammation, particularly implicated in bronchial asthma. LTC4 synthase (LTC4S), the pivotal enzyme for the biosynthesis of LTC4 (ref. 10), is an 18-kDa integral nuclear membrane protein that belongs to a superfamily of membrane-associated proteins in eicosanoid and glutathione metabolism that includes 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein, microsomal glutathione S-transferases (MGSTs), and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase 1 (ref. 13). LTC4S conjugates glutathione to LTA4, the endogenous substrate derived from arachidonic acid through the 5-lipoxygenase pathway. In contrast with MGST2 and MGST3 (refs 15, 16), LTC4S does not conjugate glutathione to xenobiotics. Here we show the atomic structure of human LTC4S in a complex with glutathione at 3.3 A resolution by X-ray crystallography and provide insights into the high substrate specificity for glutathione and LTA4 that distinguishes LTC4S from other MGSTs. The LTC4S monomer has four transmembrane alpha-helices and forms a threefold symmetric trimer as a unit with functional domains across each interface. Glutathione resides in a U-shaped conformation within an interface between adjacent monomers, and this binding is stabilized by a loop structure at the top of the interface. LTA4 would fit into the interface so that Arg 104 of one monomer activates glutathione to provide the thiolate anion that attacks C6 of LTA4 to form a thioether bond, and Arg 31 in the neighbouring monomer donates a proton to form a hydroxyl group at C5, resulting in 5(S)-hydroxy-6(R)-S-glutathionyl-7,9-trans-11,14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid (LTC4). These findings provide a structural basis for the development of LTC4S inhibitors for a proinflammatory pathway mediated by three cysteinyl leukotriene ligands whose stability and potency are different and by multiple cysteinyl leukotriene receptors whose functions may be non-redundant.
23558747	Impaired in vivo binding of MeCP2 to chromatin in the absence of its DNA methyl-binding domain.	MeCP2 is a methyl-CpG-binding protein that is a main component of brain chromatin in vertebrates. In vitro studies have determined that in addition to its specific methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) MeCP2 also has several chromatin association domains. However, the specific interactions of MeCP2 with methylated or non-methylated chromatin regions and the structural characteristics of the resulting DNA associations in vivo remain poorly understood. We analysed the role of the MBD in MeCP2-chromatin associations in vivo using an MeCP2 mutant Rett syndrome mouse model (Mecp2(tm)(1)(.)(1)(Jae)) in which exon 3 deletion results in an N-terminal truncation of the protein, including most of the MBD. Our results show that in mutant mice, the truncated form of MeCP2 (ΔMeCP2) is expressed in different regions of the brain and liver, albeit at 50% of its wild-type (wt) counterpart. In contrast to the punctate nuclear distribution characteristic of wt MeCP2, ΔMeCP2 exhibits both diffuse nuclear localization and a substantial retention in the cytoplasm, suggesting a dysfunction of nuclear transport. In mutant brain tissue, neuronal nuclei are smaller, and ΔMeCP2 chromatin is digested faster by nucleases, producing a characteristic nuclease-resistant dinucleosome. Although a fraction of ΔMeCP2 is found associated with nucleosomes, its interaction with chromatin is transient and weak. Thus, our results unequivocally demonstrate that in vivo the MBD of MeCP2 together with its adjacent region in the N-terminal domain are critical for the proper interaction of the protein with chromatin, which cannot be replaced by any other of its protein domains.
11513839	Serotonergic effects and extracellular brain levels of eletriptan, zolmitriptan and sumatriptan in rat brain.	In vivo microdialysis was used to assess the central serotonergic effects and extracellular brain levels of the 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonists eletriptan, zolmitriptan and sumatriptan in rats after intravenous and intracerebral administration, while their binding affinities and functional potencies were determined at 5-HT(1B), 5-HT(1D) and 5-HT(1A) receptors. In vitro studies showed that all three triptans are high affinity, full agonists at 5-HT(1B/1D) receptors, but that sumatriptan is functionally less potent as a 5-HT(1B/1D) agonist than zolmitriptan and eletriptan. Local intracortical perfusion with the compounds via the dialysis probe decreased cortical 5-HT (5-hydroxytryptamine, serotonin) release with ED(50) values of approximately 0.1 microM for eletriptan and zolmitriptan and 0.5 microM for sumatriptan. At 3.2 mg/kg i.v., both eletriptan and zolmitriptan decreased 5-HT levels by about 35%, while sumatriptan had no effect, despite the fact that maximal sumatriptan concentrations in cortical dialysates were higher (8.8 nM at 20 min) than those of zolmitriptan (5.9 nM at 20 min) and eletriptan (2.6 nM at 40 min). The observation that eletriptan and zolmitriptan produce almost identical central serotonergic effects, after intracerebral as well as after systemic administration, is in agreement with their comparable functional 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonist potencies and their free levels in cortical dialysates after 3.2 mg/kg i.v. On the other hand, the lack of central serotonergic effects of 3.2 mg/kg i.v. sumatriptan is likely due to its weaker functional 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonist potency than eletriptan and zolmitriptan, rather than lower brain levels, consistent with sumatriptan's fivefold lower potency after intracerebral administration.
23319419	ICA-105574 interacts with a common binding site to elicit opposite effects on inactivation gating of EAG and ERG potassium channels.	Rapid and voltage-dependent inactivation greatly attenuates outward currents in ether-a-go-go-related gene (ERG) K(+) channels. In contrast, inactivation of related ether-a-go-go (EAG) K(+) channels is very slow and minimally reduces outward currents. ICA-105574 (ICA, or 3-nitro-N-[4-phenoxyphenyl]-benzamide) has opposite effects on inactivation of these two channel types. Although ICA greatly attenuates ERG inactivation by shifting its voltage dependence to more positive potentials, it enhances the rate and extent of EAG inactivation without altering its voltage dependence. Here, we investigate whether the inverse functional response to ICA in EAG and ERG channels is related to differences in ICA binding site or to intrinsic mechanisms of inactivation. Molecular modeling coupled with site-directed mutagenesis suggests that ICA binds in a channel-specific orientation to a hydrophobic pocket bounded by the S5/pore helix/S6 of one subunit and S6 of an adjacent subunit. ICA is a mixed agonist of mutant EAG and EAG/ERG chimera channels that inactivate by a combination of slow and fast mechanisms. With the exception of three residues, the specific amino acids that form the putative binding pocket for ICA in ERG are conserved in EAG. Mutations introduced into EAG to replicate the ICA binding site in ERG did not alter the functional response to ICA. Together these findings suggest that ICA binds to the same site in EAG and ERG channels to elicit opposite functional effects. The resultant agonist or antagonist activity is determined solely by channel-specific differences in the mechanisms of inactivation gating.
7769797	Responses to an orally active renin inhibitor, remikiren (Ro 42-5892), after controlled salt depletion in humans.	The biological effects of dose-dependent inhibition of renin have rarely been extensively studied after oral (p.o.) dosing in humans. We studied remikiren (Ro42-4892), a selective renin inhibitor, in normal volunteers after activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) based on salt depletion. Twelve normal men (28 +/- 9 years, 77 +/- 10 kg), comprising three consecutive dose panels of 4 subjects, received four treatments, double-blind and randomised 2 weeks apart: panel I, placebo (P), or 30, 100, and 300 mg, remikiren; panel II, placebo or 300, 600 mg, 1,000; panel III, placebo or 30, 600, and 1,000 mg. The RAS was activated by 40 mmol/day sodium diet plus frusemide (40 mg BDS), for 3 days before each study day. Data (mean +/- SD) were examined by repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). RAS activation was confirmed by 24-h urinary sodium excretion (screen, 142 +/- 74 mmol/24 h; prestudy, 66 +/- 33, 59 +/- 41, 78 +/- 4, 73 +/- 30 mmol/24 h) and increase in plasma renin activity (PRA) (screen, 0.8 +/- 0.3 ng AI/ml/h; before dosing, P, 6.5 +/- 3.1; 30 mg, 8.2 +/- 3; 100 mg, 9.4 +/- 5.7; 300 mg, 6.5 +/- 2.4; 600 mg, 5.2 +/- 2; 1,000 mg, 6.2 +/- 4.4 ng AI/ml/h).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
8344937	Epithelial glycoprotein-330 mediates endocytosis of plasminogen activator-plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 complexes.	Epithelial glycoprotein 330 (gp330) is structurally similar to the multifunctional alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (alpha 2MR/LRP), gp330 and alpha 2MR/LRP bind Ca2+ with high affinity, and both receptors bind and mediate endocytosis of alpha 2MR-associated protein (RAP). In the present report, we describe that affinity-purified gp330 from rabbit renal cortex binds plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) complexed with urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). alpha 2M-methylamine, which binds with high affinity to alpha 2MR/LRP, did not bind to gp330. The apparent Kd for binding of uPA.PAI-1 complexes was about 0.8 nM at 4 degrees C. The binding was calcium-dependent and inhibited by recombinant RAP (rRAP) and tissue type plasminogen activator-PAI-1 complexes. Thin sections of rabbit renal proximal tubules bound 125I-labeled uPA.PAI-1 and rRAP in the apical part of proximal tubules corresponding to the localization of gp330. The binding of 125I-uPA.PAI-1 complexes in tubules was abolished by excess unlabeled rRAP, and a rRAP-inhibitable endocytosis and degradation of labeled uPA.PAI-1 complexes was demonstrated by perfusion of isolated rabbit proximal tubules. The results establish an endocytotic function of gp330 and suggest that gp330 is an important component of the fibrinolytic system in gp330-containing epithelial as found in, for example, kidney and lung.
10917903	Addition of eicosapentaenoic acid to gamma-linolenic acid-supplemented diets prevents serum arachidonic acid accumulation in humans.	Previous studies reveal that supplementation of human diets with gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) reduces the generation of lipid mediators of inflammation and attenuates clinical symptoms of chronic inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. However, we have shown that supplementation with this same fatty acid also causes a marked increase in serum arachidonate (AA) levels, a potentially harmful side effect. The objective of this study was to design a supplementation strategy that maintained the capacity of GLA to reduce lipid mediators without causing elevations in serum AA levels. Initial in vitro studies utilizing HEP-G2 liver cells revealed that addition of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) blocked Delta-5-desaturase activity, the terminal enzymatic step in AA synthesis. To test the in vivo effects of a GLA and EPA combination in humans, adult volunteers consuming controlled diets supplemented these diets with 3.0 g/d of GLA and EPA. This supplementation strategy significantly increased serum levels of EPA, but did not increase AA levels. EPA and the elongation product of GLA, dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) levels in neutrophil glycerolipids increased significantly during the 3-wk supplementation period. Neutrophils isolated from volunteers fed diets supplemented with GLA and EPA released similar quantities of AA, but synthesized significantly lower quantities of leukotrienes compared with their neutrophils before supplementation. This study revealed that a GLA and EPA supplement combination may be utilized to reduce the synthesis of proinflammatory AA metabolites, and importantly, not induce potentially harmful increases in serum AA levels.
12358053	The effects of cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors on bile-injured and normal equine colon.	A potential adverse effect of cyclo-oxygenase (COX) inhibitors (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) in horses is colitis. In addition, we have previously shown an important role for COX-produced prostanoids in recovery of ischaemic-injured equine jejunum. It was hypothesised that the nonselective COX inhibitor flunixin would retard repair of bile-injured colon by preventing production of reparative prostaglandins, whereas the selective COX-2 inhibitor, etodolac would not inhibit repair as a result of continued COX-1 activity. Segments of the pelvic flexure were exposed to 1.5 mmol/l deoxycholate for 30 min, after which they were recovered for 4 h in Ussing chambers. Contrary to the proposed hypothesis, recovery of bile-injured colonic mucosa was not affected by flunixin or etodolac, despite significantly depressed prostanoid production. However, treatment of control tissue with flunixin led to increases in mucosal permeability, whereas treatment with etodolac had no significant effect. Therefore, although recovery from bile-induced colonic injury maybe independent of COX-elaborated prostanoids, treatment of control tissues with nonselective COX inhibitors may lead to marked increases in permeability. Alternatively, selective inhibition of COX-2 may reduce the incidence of adverse effects in horses requiring NSAID therapy.
23523781	Pharmacokinetic, neurochemical, stereological and neuropathological studies on the potential effects of paraquat in the substantia nigra pars compacta and striatum of male C57BL/6J mice.	The pharmacokinetics and neurotoxicity of paraquat dichloride (PQ) were assessed following once weekly administration to C57BL/6J male mice by intraperitoneal injection for 1, 2 or 3 weeks at doses of 10, 15 or 25mg/kg/week. Approximately 0.3% of the administered dose was taken up by the brain and was slowly eliminated, with a half-life of approximately 3 weeks. PQ did not alter the concentration of dopamine (DA), homovanillic acid (HVA) or 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), or increase dopamine turnover in the striatum. There was inconsistent stereological evidence of a loss of DA neurons, as identified by chromogenic or fluorescent-tagged antibodies to tyrosine hydroxylase in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). There was no evidence that PQ induced neuronal degeneration in the SNpc or degenerating neuronal processes in the striatum, as indicated by the absence of uptake of silver stain or reduced immunolabeling of tyrosine-hydroxylase-positive (TH(+)) neurons. There was no evidence of apoptotic cell death, which was evaluated using TUNEL or caspase 3 assays. Microglia (IBA-1 immunoreactivity) and astrocytes (GFAP immunoreactivity) were not activated in PQ-treated mice 4, 8, 16, 24, 48, 96 or 168h after 1, 2 or 3 doses of PQ. In contrast, mice dosed with the positive control substance, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP; 10mg/kg/dose×4 doses, 2h apart), displayed significantly reduced DA and DOPAC concentrations and increased DA turnover in the striatum 7 days after dosing. The number of TH(+) neurons in the SNpc was reduced, and there were increased numbers of degenerating neurons and neuronal processes in the SNpc and striatum. MPTP-mediated cell death was not attributed to apoptosis. MPTP activated microglia and astrocytes within 4h of the last dose, reaching a peak within 48h. The microglial response ended by 96h in the SNpc, but the astrocytic response continued through 168h in the striatum. These results bring into question previous published stereological studies that report loss of TH(+) neurons in the SNpc of PQ-treated mice. This study also suggests that even if the reduction in TH(+) neurons reported by others occurs in PQ-treated mice, this apparent phenotypic change is unaccompanied by neuronal cell death or by modification of dopamine levels in the striatum.
23289710	Mammalian Trit1 is a tRNA([Ser]Sec)-isopentenyl transferase required for full selenoprotein expression.	Selenoproteins are proteins carrying the rare amino acid Sec (selenocysteine). Full expression of selenoproteins requires modification of tRNA([Ser]Sec), including N(6)-isopentenylation of base A(37). We show that Trit1 is a dimethylallyl:tRNA([Ser]Sec) transferase. Knockdown of Trit1 reduces expression of selenoproteins. Incubation of in vitro transcribed tRNA[Ser]Sec with recombinant Trit1 transfers [(14)C]dimethylallyl pyrophosphate to tRNA([Ser]Sec). 37A>G tRNA([Ser]Sec) is resistant to isopentenylation by Trit1.
12668769	Investigating the regulation of one-carbon metabolism in Arabidopsis thaliana.	Serine (Ser) biosynthesis in C(3) plants can occur via several pathways. One major route involves the tetrahydrofolate (THF)-dependent activities of the glycine decarboxylase complex (GDC, EC 2.1.1.10) and serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT, EC 2.1.2.1) with glycine (Gly) as one-carbon (1-C) source. An alternative THF-dependent pathway involves the C1-THF synthase/SHMT activities with formate as 1-C source. Here, we have investigated aspects of the regulation of these two folate-mediated pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. Columbia using two approaches. Firstly, transgenic plants overexpressing formate dehydrogenase (FDH, EC 1.2.1.2) were used to continue our previous studies on the function of FDH in formate metabolism. The formate pool size was approximately 73 nmol (g FW)(-1) in wild type (WT) Arabidopsis plants; three independent transgenic lines had similar-sized pools of formate. Transgenic plants produced more (13)CO(2) from supplied [(13)C]formate than did WT plants but were not significantly different from WT plants in their synthesis of Ser. We concluded that FDH has no direct role in the regulation of the above two pathways of Ser synthesis; the breakdown of formate to CO(2) by the FDH reaction is the primary and preferred fate of the organic acid in Arabidopsis. The ratio between the GDC/SHMT and C1-THF synthase/SHMT pathways of Ser synthesis from [alpha-(13)C]Gly and [(13)C]formate, respectively, in Arabidopsis shoots was 21 : 1; in roots, 9 : 1. In shoots, therefore, the pathway from formate plays only a small role in Ser synthesis; in the case of roots, results indicated that the 9 : 1 ratio was as a result of greater fluxes of (13)C through both pathways together with a relatively higher contribution from the C1-THF synthase/SHMT route than in shoots. We also examined the synthesis of Ser in a GDC-deficient mutant of Arabidopsis (glyD) where the GDC/SHMT pathway was impaired. Compared with WT, glyD plants accumulated 5-fold more Gly than WT after supplying [alpha-(13)C]Gly for 24 h; the accumulation of Ser from [alpha-(13)C]Gly was reduced by 25% in the same time period. On the other hand, the accumulation of Ser through the C1-THF synthase/SHMT pathway in glyD plants was 2.5-fold greater than that in WT plants. Our experiments confirmed that the GDC/SHMT and C1-THF synthase/SHMT pathways normally operate independently in Arabidopsis plants but that when the primary GDC/SHMT pathway is impaired the alternative C1-THF synthase/SHMT pathway can partially compensate for deficiencies in the synthesis of Ser.
18162179	Covalent modification of stathmin by CCNU determined by FTMS analysis of modified proteins and tryptic peptides.	Chemical modification of proteins is often carried out to generate protein-small molecule conjugates for various applications. The high resolution and mass accuracy of a Fourier transform mass spectrometer is particularly useful for assessing the extent or sites of covalent modifications. As protein-small molecule reactions often produce products with variable numbers of the compound incorporated at different sites, a direct mass analysis of the reaction products at times yields mass spectra hard to interpret. Chromatographic separation at protein level could reduce the complexity of a sample, thus allowing more accurate mass spectrometric analysis. In this report, we demonstrate the utility of reversed-phase protein chromatography and FT-ICR mass spectrometry in analyzing CCNU (lomustine, 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitroso-urea, MW: 233.7Da) modification of stathmin. With this combined approach, we determined the stoichiometry as well as sites of CCNU incorporation into the protein, demonstrating differential reactivity of several lysyl residues to CCNU alkylation.
23480174	MD simulations of the formation of stable clusters in mixtures of alkaline salts and imidazolium-based ionic liquids.	Structural and dynamical properties of room-temperature ionic liquids containing the cation 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium ([BMIM](+)) and three different anions (hexafluorophosphate, [PF6](-), tetrafluoroborate, [BF4](-), and bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, [NTf2](-)) doped with several molar fractions of lithium salts with a common anion at 298.15 K and 1 atm were investigated by means of molecular dynamics simulations. The effect of the size of the salt cation was also analyzed by comparing these results with those for mixtures of [BMIM][PF6] with NaPF6. Lithium/sodium solvation and ionic mobilities were analyzed via the study of radial distribution functions, coordination numbers, cage autocorrelation functions, mean-square displacements (including the analysis of both ballistic and diffusive regimes), self-diffusion coefficients of all the ionic species, velocity and current autocorrelation functions, and ionic conductivity in all the ionic liquid/salt systems. We found that lithium and sodium cations are strongly coordinated in two different positions with the anion present in the mixture. Moreover, [Li](+) and [Na](+) cations were found to form bonded-like, long-lived aggregates with the anions in their first solvation shell, which act as very stable kinetic entities within which a marked rattling motion of salt ions takes place. With very long MD simulation runs, this phenomenon is proved to be on the basis of the decrease of self-diffusion coefficients and ionic conductivities previously reported in experimental and computational results.
16478774	Infusion of ACTH stimulates expression of adrenal ACTH receptor and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein mRNA in fetal sheep.	The late-gestation plasma cortisol surge in the sheep fetus is critical for stimulating organ development and parturition. Increased adrenal responsiveness is one of the key reasons for the surge; however, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Our recent studies suggest that ACTH-mediated increased expression of ACTH receptor (ACTH-R) and steroid acute regulatory protein (StAR) may play a role in enhancing responsiveness. Hence, we examined effects of ACTH infusion in fetal sheep on mRNA expression of these two mediators of adrenal responsiveness and assessed the functional consequences of this treatment in vitro. Fetuses of approximately 118 and 138 days of gestational age (dGA) were infused with ACTH-(1-24) for 24 h. Controls received saline infusion. Arterial blood was sampled throughout the infusion. Adrenals were isolated and analyzed for ACTH-R and StAR mRNA, or cells were cultured for 48 h. Cells were stimulated with ACTH, and medium was collected for cortisol measurement. Fetal plasma ACTH and cortisol concentrations increased over the infusion period in both groups. ACTH-R mRNA levels were significantly higher in ACTH-infused fetuses in both the 118 and 138 dGA groups. StAR mRNA increased significantly in both the 118 and 138 dGA groups. Adrenal cells from ACTH-infused fetuses were significantly more responsive to ACTH stimulation in terms of cortisol secretion than those from saline-infused controls. These findings demonstrate that increases in circulating ACTH levels promote increased expression of ACTH-R and StAR mRNA and are coupled to heightened adrenal responsiveness.
17341305	Association of estrogen receptor-alpha and progesterone receptor A expression with hormonal mammary carcinogenesis: role of the host microenvironment.	INTRODUCTION: Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) induces estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and progesterone receptor (PR)-positive ductal invasive mammary carcinomas in BALB/c mice. We sought to reproduce this MPA cancer model in C57BL/6 mice because of their widespread use in genetic engineering. Within this experimental setting, we studied the carcinogenic effects of MPA, the morphologic changes in mammary glands that are induced by MPA and progesterone, and the levels of ER and PR expression in MPA-treated and progesterone-treated mammary glands. Finally, we evaluated whether the differences found between BALB/c and C57BL/6 mouse strains were due to intrinsic differences in epithelial cells. METHODS: The carcinogenic effect of MPA was evaluated in C57BL/6 mice using protocols proven to be carcinogenic in BALB/c mice. In addition, BALB/c and C57BL/6 females were treated with progesterone or MPA for 1 or 2 months, and mammary glands were excised for histologic studies and for immunohistochemical and Western blot evaluation of ER and PR. Hormone levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. Isolated mammary epithelial cells were transplanted into cleared fat pads of 21-day-old female Swiss nu/nu mice or control congenic animals. RESULTS: MPA failed to induce mammary carcinomas or significant morphologic changes in the mammary glands of C57BL/6 mice. The expression of ER-alpha and PR isoform A in virgin mice was surprisingly much higher in BALB/c than in C57BL/6 mammary glands, and both receptors were downregulated in progestin-treated BALB/c mice (P < 0.05). PR isoform B levels were low in virgin control mice and increased after progestin treatment in both strains. ER-beta expression followed a similar trend. No differences in hormone levels were found between strains. Surprisingly, the transplantation of the epithelial mammary gland cells of both strains into the cleared fat pads of Swiss (nu/nu) mice abolished the mammary gland morphologic differences and the ER and PR differences between strains. CONCLUSION: C57BL/6 mammary glands are resistant to MPA-induced carcinogenesis and to hormone action. MPA and progesterone have different effects on mammary glands. Low ER-alpha and PR-A levels in untreated mammary glands may be associated with a low-risk breast cancer profile. Although we cannot at this time rule out the participation of other, untested factors, our findings implicate the stroma as playing a crucial role in the strain-specific differential hormone receptor expression and hormone responsiveness.
23524160	Synthesis and biological evaluation of novel pyrrolidine-2,5-dione derivatives as potential antidepressant agents. Part 1.	A series of 3-(1H-indol-3-yl)pyrrolidine-2,5-dione derivatives was synthesized and their biological activity was evaluated. The chemical structures of the newly prepared compounds were confirmed by (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and ESI-HRMS spectra data. All tested compounds proved to be potent 5-HT1A receptor and serotonin transporter protein (SERT) ligands. Among them, compounds 15, 18, 19 and 30 showed significant affinity for 5-HT1A and SERT. Computer docking simulations carried out for compounds 15, 31 and 32 to models of 5-HT1A receptor and SERT confirm the results of biological tests. Due to high affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor and moderate affinity for SERT, compounds 31, 32, 35, and 37 were evaluated for their affinity for D2L, 5-HT6, 5-HT7 and 5-HT2A receptors. In vivo tests, in turn, resulted in determining the functional activity of compounds 15, 18, 19 and 30 to the 5-HT1A receptor. The results of these tests indicate that all of the ligands possess properties characteristic of 5-HT1A receptor agonists.
20496522	Alpha-2B adrenergic receptor mediated hemodynamic profile of etomidate.	Etomidate has been used since 1972 as an inductor and in maintaining anesthesia. There are multiple mechanisms that account for the biologic effects of etomidate. One of the most prominent features of this drug is that it provides anesthesia without gross changes in hemodynamic parameters. This feature allows using etomidate in patients with considerable cardiopulmonary compromise avoiding the characteristic hypotension produced by other anesthetics. The mechanism that provides the basis for its cardiovascular stability is the capacity to bind and stimulate peripheral alpha-2B adrenergic receptors with a subsequent vasoconstriction. Alterations in the function or number of these receptors may account for abnormal responses during etomidate induction.
23418859	Salidroside attenuates myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury via PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.	To investigate the cardioprotective effects of salidroside on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in rabbits and the underlying action mechanisms in PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, a rabbit ischemia/reperfusion model was created by ligating the left anterior descending coronary arterial branch for 30 min and by releasing the ligature to allow reperfusion for 120 min. Salidroside or salidroside+PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) was administered via intracoronary injections at the onset of reperfusion. Apoptosis of cardiomyocytes was assessed by terminal dUTP nick-end labeling assay, and the expression of apoptosis-related proteins was observed by immunohistochemistry. The expressions of total Akt and phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) were detected by western blot analysis. The results showed that intracoronary injection of salidroside at the onset of reperfusion markedly reduced the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes, significantly increasing Bcl-2 and p-Akt proteins expressions and decreasing Bax and caspase-3 expressions in the hearts subjected to ischemia followed by 120-min reperfusion. However, the anti-apoptotic effect induced by salidroside was inhibited by LY294002, which blocked the activation of Akt. These results suggested that intracoronary administration of salidroside at the onset of reperfusion could significantly reduce the IRI-induced apoptosis of cardiomyocytes, and this protective mechanism seemed to be mediated by the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.
22981459	Human plasma-derived BuChE as a stoichiometric bioscavenger for treatment of nerve agent poisoning.	Potent organophosphorous (OP) agents, such as VX, are hazardous by absorption through the skin and are resistant to conventional pharmacological antidotal treatments. The residence time of a stoichiometric bioscavenger, human butyrylcholinesterase (huBuChE), in the plasma more closely matches that of VX than do the residence times of conventional therapy drugs (oxime, anti-muscarinic, anticonvulsant). Intramuscular (i.m.) huBuChE afforded almost complete protection when administered prior to the onset of observable cholinergic signs of VX poisoning, but once signs of poisoning became evident the efficacy of i.m. huBuChE decreased. A combination of nerve agent therapy drugs (oxime, anti-muscarinic, anticonvulsant) with huBuChE (i.m.) protected 100% (8/8) of guinea-pigs from a lethal dose of VX (0.74mg/kg) to 48h, even when administered on signs of poisoning. Survival was presumed to be due to immediate alleviation of the cholinergic crisis by the conventional pharmacological treatment drugs, in conjunction with bioscavenger that prevented further absorbed agent reaching the AChE targets. Evidence to support this proposed mechanism of action was obtained from PKPD experiments in which multiple blood samples and microdialysate samples were collected from individual conscious ambulatory animals. Plasma concentrations of intramuscularly-administered atropine, diazepam and HI-6 reached a peak within 15min and were eliminated rapidly within 4h. Plasma concentrations of huBuChE administered by the i.m. route took approximately 24h to reach a peak, but were well-maintained over the subsequent 7days. Thus, the pharmacological therapy rapidly treated the initial signs of poisoning, whilst the bioscavenger provided prolonged protection by neutralising further nerve agent entering the bloodstream and preventing it from reaching the target organs.
10905636	Identification of mu-class glutathione transferases M2-2 and M3-3 as cytosolic prostaglandin E synthases in the human brain.	Cytosolic prostaglandin (PG) E synthase was purified from human brain cortex. The N-terminal amino acid sequence, PMTLGYXNIRGL, was identical to that of the human mu-class glutathione transferase (GST) M2 subunit. Complementary DNAs for human GSTM2, GSTM3, and GSTM4 subunits were cloned, and recombinant proteins were expressed as homodimers in Escherichia coli. The recombinant GSTM2-2 and 3-3 catalyzed the conversion of PGH2 to PGE2 at the rates of 282 and 923 nmol/min/mg of protein, respectively, at the optimal pH of 8, whereas GSTM4-4 was inactive; although all three enzymes showed GST activity. The PGE synthase activity depended on thiols, such as glutathione, dithiothreitol, 2-mercaptoethanol, or L-cysteine. Michaelis-Menten constants and turnover numbers for PGH2 were 141 microM and 10.8 min(-1) for GSTM2-2 and 1.5 mM and 130 min(-1) for GSTM3-3, respectively. GSTM2-2 and 3-3 may play crucial roles in temperature regulation, nociception, and sleep-wake regulation by producing PGE2 in the brain.
23147415	Mice heterozygous for AChE are more sensitive to AChE inhibitors but do not respond to BuChE inhibition.	An impaired central cholinergic system is at least partly involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, with cholinergic markers such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and protein levels decreasing as cognitive decline progresses. AD patients receive AChE inhibitor drugs to enhance cholinergic responses in the brain. The present study characterises the cholinergic system of mice heterozygous for AChE (HZ) as a suitable in vivo model for permanently reduced AChE activity. In comparison to homozygous, wild type (WT) mice, HZ mice show a 40% reduction of AChE activity in the brain, while their hippocampal ACh levels are increased by 56% as measured by microdialysis; choline acetyltransferase levels remain unaltered, and choline uptake increases 2-fold. We demonstrate that HZ mice are significantly more sensitive to local AChE inhibition (BW284c51), but remain insensitive to butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibition (bambuterol). HZ mice are also more sensitive to the peripheral application of the selective AChE inhibitor donepezil or the mixed inhibitor physostigmine; extracellular ACh levels rise significantly after administration of both drugs; also glucose levels are moderately increased indicating potentially non-cholinergic effects of donepezil. Behavioural tests show comparable cognitive function in both mouse strains. Our results are discussed in relation to the use of AChE/BuChE inhibitors in AD patients.
23295740	Tamoxifen represses miR-200 microRNAs and promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by up-regulating c-Myc in endometrial carcinoma cell lines.	Although tamoxifen (TAM), a selective estrogen receptor modulator, has been widely used in the treatment of hormone-responsive breast cancer, its estrogen-like effect increases the risk of endometrial cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms of TAM-induced endometrial carcinoma still remain unclear. In this report, we explored the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in TAM-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in ECC-1 and Ishikawa endometrial cancer cell lines and found miR-200 is involved in this process via the regulation of c-Myc. When treated with TAM, ECC-1 and Ishikawa cells were characterized by higher invasiveness and motility and underwent EMT. miR-200, a miRNA family with tumor suppressive functions in a wide range of cancers, was found reduced in response to TAM treatment. Consistent with zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2, which was confirmed as a direct target of miR-200b in endometrial cancer cell lines, some other key factors of EMT such as Snail and N-cadherin increased, whereas E-cadherin decreased in the TAM-treated cells, contributing to TAM-induced EMT in these endometrial cancer cells. In addition, we showed that c-Myc directly binds to and represses the promoter of miR-200 miRNAs, and its up-regulation in TAM-treated endometrial cancer cells leads to the down-regulation of miR-200 and eventually to EMT. Collectively, our data suggest that TAM can repress the miR-200 family and induce EMT via the up-regulation of c-Myc in endometrial cancer cells. These findings describe a possible mechanism of TAM-induced EMT in endometrial cancer and provide a potential new therapeutic strategy for it.
23287700	Cannabinoid discrimination and antagonism by CB(1) neutral and inverse agonist antagonists.	Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB(1)) inverse agonists (e.g., rimonabant) have been reported to produce adverse effects including nausea, emesis, and anhedonia that limit their clinical applications. Recent laboratory studies suggest that the effects of CB(1) neutral antagonists differ from those of such inverse agonists, raising the possibility of improved clinical utility. However, little is known regarding the antagonist properties of neutral antagonists. In the present studies, the CB(1) inverse agonist SR141716A (rimonabant) and the CB(1) neutral antagonist AM4113 were compared for their ability to modify CB(1) receptor-mediated discriminative stimulus effects in nonhuman primates trained to discriminate the novel CB(1) full agonist AM4054. Results indicate that AM4054 serves as an effective CB(1) discriminative stimulus, with an onset and time course of action comparable with that of the CB(1) agonist Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol, and that the inverse agonist rimonabant and the neutral antagonist AM4113 produce dose-related rightward shifts in the AM4054 dose-effect curve, indicating that both drugs surmountably antagonize the discriminative stimulus effects of AM4054. Schild analyses further show that rimonabant and AM4113 produce highly similar antagonist effects, as evident in comparable pA(2) values (6.9). Taken together with previous studies, the present data suggest that the improved safety profile suggested for CB(1) neutral antagonists over inverse agonists is not accompanied by a loss of antagonist action at CB(1) receptors.
7678677	Alprenolol and bromoacetylalprenololmenthane are competitive slowly reversible antagonists at the beta 1-adrenoceptors of rat left atria.	We studied the effects of alprenolol and bromoacetylalprenololmenthane (BAAM) on rat left atria. Alprenolol and BAAM at 10(-7), 3 x 10(-7), and 10(-6) M inhibited the cardiac stimulation response slightly, which is indicative of membrane-stabilizing activity independent of beta-adrenoceptor blockade. This membrane-stabilizing activity was readily reversible. Alprenolol and BAAM also caused surmountable antagonism of isoprenaline responses, and this beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonism was slowly reversible. Inhibition of the isoprenaline responses with alprenolol and BAAM at 10(-6) M was at equilibrium after 60 min, which is indicative of reversible antagonism. We conclude that alprenolol and BAAM are competitive slowly reversible beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonists on rat left atria.
12907443	Effects of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine on fetal hemoglobin levels, red cell adhesion, and hematopoietic differentiation in patients with sickle cell disease.	Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) decreases polymerization of sickle hemoglobin (HbS) and improves outcomes in sickle cell disease (SSD). Therefore, a therapeutic goal in SSD is pharmacologic reactivation of HbF. Silencing of the gamma-globin (HbF) gene is associated with DNA methylation. The cytosine analog 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. We examined if subcutaneous decitabine could increase HbF levels and improve SSD pathophysiology without cytotoxicity. Eight symptomatic SSD patients resistant or intolerant of standard treatment with hydroxyurea received decitabine 0.2 mg/kg subcutaneously 1 to 3 times per week in 2 cycles of 6-week duration. Treatment decreased neutrophils and increased mean HbF (6.5% to 20.4%, P <.0001) and mean total hemoglobin (76 to 96 g/L [7.6 to 9.6 g/dL], P <.001). Features of vaso-occlusive crisis pathophysiology such as red cell adhesion, endothelial damage, and coagulation pathway activity significantly improved. gamma-Globin gene promoter methylation decreased, and platelets and the proportion of megakaryocytes and erythroid cells in the marrow increased without a decrease in marrow cellularity, consistent with a DNA hypomethylating, noncytotoxic mechanism of action. Weekly subcutaneous decitabine produces cumulative increases in HbF and total hemoglobin through a noncytotoxic mechanism of action. Chronic dosing and sustained increases in hemoglobin F and total hemoglobin levels may be possible. Further studies in SSD and thalassemia are indicated.
23296100	Manganese-induced oxidative DNA damage in neuronal SH-SY5Y cells: attenuation of thymine base lesions by glutathione and N-acetylcysteine.	Manganese (Mn) is an essential trace element required for normal function and development. However, exposure to this metal at elevated levels may cause manganism, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with neurological symptoms similar to idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). Elevated body burdens of Mn from exposure to parental nutrition, vapors in mines and smelters and welding fumes have been associated with neurological health concerns. The underlying mechanism of Mn neurotoxicity remains unclear. Accordingly, the present study was designed to investigate the toxic effects of Mn(2+) in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Mn(2+) caused a concentration dependent decrease in SH-SY5Y cellular viability compared to controls. The LD50 value was 12.98 μM Mn(2+) (p<0.001 for control vs. 24h Mn treatment). Both TUNEL and annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) apoptosis assays confirmed the induction of apoptosis in the cells following exposure to Mn(2+) (2 μM, 62 μM or 125 μM). In addition, Mn(2+) induced both the formation and accumulation of DNA single strand breaks (via alkaline comet assay analysis) and oxidatively modified thymine bases (via gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis). Pre-incubation of the cells with characteristic antioxidants, either 1mM N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or 1mM glutathione (GSH) reduced the level of DNA strand breaks and the formation of thymine base lesions, suggesting protection against oxidative cellular damage. Our findings indicate that (1) exposure of SH-SY5Y cells to Mn promotes both the formation and accumulation of oxidative DNA damage, (2) SH-SY5Y cells with accumulated DNA damage are more likely to die via an apoptotic pathway and (3) the accumulated levels of DNA damage can be abrogated by the addition of exogenous chemical antioxidants. This is the first known report of Mn(2+)-induction and antioxidant protection of thymine lesions in this SH-SY5Y cell line and contributes new information to the potential use of antioxidants as a therapeutic strategy for protection against Mn(2+)-induced oxidative DNA damage.
15854045	Regulation of the expression of peptidylarginine deiminase type II gene (PADI2) in human keratinocytes involves Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors.	Peptidylarginine deiminases (PAD) convert protein-bound arginine residues into citrulline residues in a Ca(2+) ion-dependent manner. Among the five isoforms (PAD1, 2, 3, 4, and 6) existing in rodents and humans, PAD2 is the most widely expressed in both species, tissues, and organs. In order to study the mechanisms regulating the expression of the human PAD2 gene, PADI2, we characterized its promoter region using transfected human keratinocytes. A series of reporter gene constructions derived from the 2 kb region upstream of the transcription initiation site defined a minimal promoter sequence from nucleotides -132 to -41. This PADI2 region is GC-rich and lacks canonical TATA and CAAT boxes. Investigation of cis-acting elements in the region, further deletion analyses and electrophoretic mobility shift assays using specific antibodies revealed four Sp1-binding sites and identified Sp1 and Sp3 as binding factors important for the promoter activity. These results suggest that Sp1/Sp3 cooperation may provide a mechanism to control the transcription of PADI2.
23299191	Effects of asymmetric dimethylarginine on inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10) in rats.	This study is intended to examine the effects of administration of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) on the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-10. A total of 30 Wistar adult albino rats were used. Group I was administrated (n = 10) with 1 mg/kg/day of ADMA, group II (n = 10) was administrated with 2 mg/kg/day of ADMA and the control group was administrated (n = 10) with 0.9% sodium chloride. ADMA was intraperitoneally administrated for 7 days. The serum levels of IL-6, TNF-α and IL-10 were measured. There was a significant decrease in the levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10 in group I compared with that of the control group (p < 0.001). There was also a significant decrease in the levels of IL-10 in group II compared with that of the control group (p < 0.05) but the increase was much more distinct in the levels of IL-6 and TNF-α (p < 0.001). When comparing the groups by the doses given, no difference between the levels of IL-6 and IL-10 in groups I and II (p > 0.05) was observed; the levels of TNF-α in group II were significantly lower than those of group I (p < 0.05). A significant decrease in the serum levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-α and IL-10, after administration of 1 mg/kg/day and 2 mg/kg/day of ADMA, indicates that ADMA has an effect on inflammation. Increase in ADMA levels in the rats shows that the effects of inflammatory cytokines were suppressed.

23579182	Clinical and Subclinical Macrovascular Disease as Predictors of Cognitive Decline in Older Patients With Type 2 Diabetes: The Edinburgh Type 2 Diabetes Study.	OBJECTIVEMacrovascular disease may contribute to increased risk of accelerated cognitive decline in patients with type 2 diabetes. We aimed to determine associations of measures of macrovascular disease with cognitive change in a cognitively healthy older population with type 2 diabetes.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSEight-hundred thirty-one men and women (aged 60-75 years) attended two waves of the prospective Edinburgh Type 2 Diabetes Study (ET2DS). At baseline, clinical and subclinical macrovascular disease was measured, including cardiovascular event history, carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), ankle brachial index (ABI), and serum N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Seven neuropsychological tests were administered at baseline and after 4 years; scores were combined to a standardized general ability factor (g). Adjustment of follow-up g for baseline g assessed 4-year cognitive change. Adjustment for vocabulary (estimated premorbid ability) was used to estimate lifetime cognitive change.RESULTSMeasures of cognitive decline were significantly associated with stroke, NT-proBNP, ABI, and cIMT, but not with nonstroke vascular events. The association of stroke with increased estimated lifetime cognitive decline (standardized β, -0.12) and of subclinical markers with actual 4-year decline (standardized β, -0.12, 0.12, and -0.15 for NT-proBNP, ABI, and cIMT, respectively) reached the Bonferroni-adjusted level of statistical significance (P < 0.006). Results altered only slightly on adjustment for vascular risk factors.CONCLUSIONSStroke and subclinical markers of cardiac stress and generalized atherosclerosis are associated with cognitive decline in older patients with type 2 diabetes. Further investigation into the potential use of subclinical vascular disease markers in predicting cognitive decline is warranted.
23007559	Developmental immunotoxicity of ethanol in an extended one-generation reproductive toxicity study.	The susceptibility of developing immune system to chemical disruption warrants the assessment of immune parameters in reproductive and developmental testing protocols. In this study, a wide range of immune endpoints was included in an extended one-generation reproduction toxicity study (EOGRTS) design to determine the relative sensitivity of immune and developmental parameters to ethanol (EtOH), a well-known developmental toxicant with immunomodulatory properties. Adult Wistar rats were exposed to EtOH via drinking water (0, 1.5, 4, 6.5, 9, 11.5 and 14 % (w/v EtOH)) during premating, mating, gestation and lactation and continuation of exposure of the F(1) from weaning until killed. Immune assessments were performed at postnatal days (PNDs) 21, 42 and 70. Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH)-specific immune responses were evaluated following subcutaneous immunizations on PNDs 21 and 35. EtOH exposure affected innate as well as adaptive immune responses. The most sensitive immune parameters included white blood cell subpopulations, ConA-stimulated splenocyte proliferation, LPS-induced NO and TNF-α production by adherent splenocytes and KLH-specific immune responses. Most parameters showed recovery after cessation of EtOH exposure after weaning in the 14 % exposure group. However, effects on LPS-induced NO and TNF-α production by adherent splenocytes and KLH-specific parameters persisted until PND 70. The results demonstrate the relative sensitivity to EtOH of especially functional immune parameters and confirm the added value of immune parameters in the EOGRTS. Furthermore, this study identified an expanded KLH-specific parameter set and LPS-induced NO and TNF-α production by adherent splenocytes as valuable parameters that can provide additional information on functional immune effects.
8200980	Two subsets of HLA-DQA1 alleles mark phenotypic variation in levels of insulin autoantibodies in first degree relatives at risk for insulin-dependent diabetes.	Levels of insulin autoantibodies (IAA) vary among different first degree relatives of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients, suggesting genetic regulation. We previously reported elevated IAA among DR4-positive at risk relatives. In this study, 72/82 at risk relatives were IAA positive, of whom 75% (54/72) carried DR4 versus 20% (2/10) of IAA-negative relatives (P = 0.0004). However, 69% (18/26) of DR4-negative relatives were IAA positive. Since DR4 did not account for all IAA positivity, we analyzed DQA1 and DQB1 alleles. Homozygosity for DQA1 alleles deriving from the evolutionary lineage 4 (*0401, *0501, *0601) was associated with low IAA levels, while lineage 1-3 alleles (*0101, *0102, *0103, *0201, *0301) correlated with higher levels. Most (93%, 65/70) relatives with lineage 1-3 alleles were IAA positive (mean = 360 +/- 63 SEM nU/ml). Only 7/12 relatives homozygous for lineage 4 alleles were IAA-positive, with lower levels than relatives with lineage 1-3 alleles (mean = 55 +/- 15 SEM nU/ml, P < 0.0001; 7/12 vs 65/70, P = 0.004). The amino acid sequences of lineage 1-3 alleles uniquely share glutamic acid (E) and phenylalanine (F) at positions 40 and 51 (EF alleles). Lineage 4 alleles have glycine (G) and leucine (L) at those positions (GL alleles). 90% (65/72) of IAA-positive relatives had an EF allele, while only 75% (54/72) had DR4 (P = 0.01). Homozygosity for GL alleles (often DQA1 *0501 on DR3 haplotypes) correlated with little or no humoral response to insulin. Thus, HLA-DQB1 GL alleles, or other genes on haplotypes (e.g., DR3) that carry these DQA1 alleles, may confer recessive low responsiveness to insulin.
23208787	From in situ to in vivo: an in situ click-chemistry-derived carbonic anhydrase II imaging agent for positron emission tomography.	CA II makes a good PET: Discovering positron emission tomography (PET) probes with high target affinities is challenging. PET probe discovery using in situ click chemistry uses (19) F-bearing fragments as (18) F surrogates. This ensures that the lead hits and PET probes have equivalent chemical or biological characteristics, making PET probe discovery predictable and reliable.
10421446	Role of edrophonium in prevention of the re-inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by phosphorylated oxime.	We examined the role of edrophonium in the acceleration phenomenon using mouse wild-type and mutant D74N AChE inhibited with 7-(O,O-diethyl-phosphinyloxy)-1-methylquinolinium methylsulfate (DEPQ). With DEPQ-inhibited wild-type mouse acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the reactivation kinetic profile demonstrated one-phase exponential association only when 2-[hydroxyimino methyl]-1-methylpyridinium chloride (2-PAM) and 1-(2-hydroxy-iminomethyl-1-pyridinium)-1-(4-carboxy-aminopyridi nium)-dimethyl ether hydrochloride (HI-6) were used as reactivators. When 1,1[oxybis-methylene)bis[4-(hydroxyimino)methyl] pyridinium dichloride (LuH6) and 1,1-trimethylene bis(4-hydroxyimino methyl) pyridinium dichloride (TMB4) were used, the reactivation kinetic profile was biphasic in nature. Edrophonium had no effect on reactivation by 2-PAM and HI-6, but significantly accelerated LuH6- and TMB4-induced reactivation of DEPQ-inhibited wild-type mouse AChE. Comparison of the initial and overall reactivation rate constants with five oximes indicated that acceleration by edrophonium may be due to the prevention of re-inhibition of the reactivated enzyme by the phosphorylated oxime (POX) produced during the reactivation. With LuH6 and TMB4, about 2.5-fold increase in the reactivation rate constants was observed in the presence of edrophonium, but little or no effect was observed with the other three oximes. The initial reactivation rate constants were 5.4- and 4.2-fold of the overall rate constants with LuH6 and TMB4 as reactivators respectively, however, very little change was found between the initial and overall rate constants with the other three oximes. In experiments with D74N AChE, for which the inhibition potency of charged organophosphate (OP) was two to three orders less than wild-type enzyme, edrophonium had no effect on the reactivation by LuH6 and TMB4 and the time courses of reactivation were monophasic. The data from mutant enzyme substantiate the involvement of edrophonium in protecting POX re-inhibition of reactivated enzyme formed during the reactivation of OP-inhibited AChE.
23631499	Possible Therapeutic Uses of Salvia triloba and Piper nigrum in Alzheimer's Disease-Induced Rats.	Abstract This study aimed to investigate the role of Salvia triloba L. and Piper nigrum extracts in ameliorating neuroinflammatory insults characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in an experimentally induced rat model. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were classified into Group 1 (n=10): normal healthy animals serving as the negative control group; Group 2 (n=60): the AD-induced group. After AD induction, animals in the AD-induced group were divided randomly and equally into 6 subgroups. The first subgroup served as AD control; the second one, which served as positive control, was treated orally with the conventional therapy for AD (rivastigmine) at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg body weight (b.w.) daily for 3 months. The third and fourth subgroups were, respectively, treated orally with the S. triloba extract at a dose of 750 and 375 mg/kg b.w. daily for 3 months. The fifth and sixth subgroups were, respectively, treated orally with the P. nigrum extract at a dose of 187.5 and 93.75 mg/kg b.w. daily for 3 months. Levels of brain acetylcholine (Ach), serum and brain acetylcholinesterase (AchE) activity, C-reactive protein (CRP), total nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) were estimated. The results showed that administration of AlCl3 resulted in a significant elevation in the levels of AchE activity, CRP, NF-κB, and MCP-1 accompanied with a significant depletion in the Ach level. Treatment of AD rats with each of the selected medicinal plant extracts caused marked improvement in the measured biochemical parameters. In conclusion, S. triloba and P. nigrum methanolic extracts have potent anti-inflammatory effects against neuroinflammation characterizing AD.
12563315	PUMA-G and HM74 are receptors for nicotinic acid and mediate its anti-lipolytic effect.	Nicotinic acid (niacin), a vitamin of the B complex, has been used for almost 50 years as a lipid-lowering drug. The pharmacological effect of nicotinic acid requires doses that are much higher than those provided by a normal diet. Its primary action is to decrease lipolysis in adipose tissue by inhibiting hormone-sensitive triglyceride lipase. This anti-lipolytic effect of nicotinic acid involves the inhibition of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation in adipose tissue through a G(i)-protein-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. A G-protein-coupled receptor for nicotinic acid has been proposed in adipocytes. Here, we show that the orphan G-protein-coupled receptor, 'protein upregulated in macrophages by interferon-gamma' (mouse PUMA-G, human HM74), is highly expressed in adipose tissue and is a nicotinic acid receptor. Binding of nicotinic acid to PUMA-G or HM74 results in a G(i)-mediated decrease in cAMP levels. In mice lacking PUMA-G, the nicotinic acid-induced decrease in free fatty acid (FFA) and triglyceride plasma levels was abrogated, indicating that PUMA-G mediates the anti-lipolytic and lipid-lowering effects of nicotinic acid in vivo. The identification of the nicotinic acid receptor may be useful in the development of new drugs to treat dyslipidemia.
23261591	Central nervous system damage due to acute paraquat poisoning: an experimental study with rat model.	Paraquat (PQ) is a common herbicide and PQ poisoning is a major medical problem in Asia. However, few studies have focused on the acute neurotoxic changes caused by PQ. Here we report the acute neurotoxicological findings of rats treated with lethal dose of PQ. In substantia nigra (SN) and striatum we found obvious microglia (labeled by Iba-1) activation within one week. In SN and hippocampus, we detected increased oxidative stress in the neurons based on NeuN/8-OHdG immunofluorescence double labeling and laser cofocal microscopy. Moreover, we provided ultrastructural evidences of astrocyte edema and neurons apoptosis in rat brain by electron microscopy. Further studies will be needed with non-lethal dose of PQ to confirm these results and demonstrate the direct CNS toxicity of PQ.
8600944	Glucocorticosteroids affect functions of airway- and blood-derived human T-cell clones, favoring the Th1 profile through two mechanisms.	Glucocorticosteroids (GCS) are beneficial in allergic asthma. GCS therapy results in reduced mRNA expression of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-5 in cells from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) but not of IFN-gamma. In vitro studies with blood-derived T cells, however, show inhibition of all three cytokines by GCS. We studied the effects of GCS on T cells from BAL in vitro, namely Th0-, Th1, and Th2-like clones; and we compared BAL- with blood-derived clones. Dexamethasone (DEX) inhibited the anti-CD3-induced production of IL-4, IL-5 and IFN-gamma in all 20 clones tested. IFN-gamma production was inhibited significantly less than IL-4 and IL-5. DEX enhanced the ratio IFN-gamma/IL-4 (mean +/- SEM: control, 28.7 +/- 17.6; with 10-7 M DEX, 55.0 +/- 27.5, P<0.005). Interestingly, two categories of clones were distinguished based on the effects of GCS on IL-2 production and IL-2R alpha expression and proliferation; 1) In low IL-2 producers DEX blocked IL-2 production and decreased IL-2R alpha expression and proliferation; 2) In high IL-2 producers DEX inhibited IL-2 production partially and enhanced IL-2R alpha expression and proliferation. Anti-IL-2 and anti-IL2R alpha blocked the DEX-induced increase in proliferation. High levels of added IL-2 induced the second type of response. In conclusion, the production of IL-4 and IL-5 by T-cell clones (derived either from BAL or blood) was more sensitive to inhibition by DEX than that of IFN-gamma, which may account for the therapeutic effects of glucocorticosteroids in patients with asthma. The differential effects of DEX on the proliferation of high and low IL-2 producers in vitro may implicate a selective outgrowth of Th1-like T cells in vivo in patients treated with steroids.
23410587	Benchmark dose for estimation of cadmium reference level for osteoporosis in a Chinese female population.	In this study, the reference level of cadmium in urine and blood related with bone damage was assessed using benchmark dose in a Chinese female population. Total of 338 women was recruited, and urine and blood samples were collected from each individual for determination of cadmium in urine (UCd) and blood (BCd). Bone mineral density was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. BMD and BMDL were calculated corresponding to additional risk of 5% and 10%. With benchmark response (BMR) of 5%/10%, the BMD of BCd, UCd related with osteoporosis was 1.88μg/L/3.23μg/L and 5.30μg/g crea/9.06μg/g crea, and the BMDL-05 was 1.39μg/L/2.38μg/L and 3.78μg/g crea/6.36μg/g crea; the BMD of BCd, UCd related with low bone mass was 0.95μg/L/3.12μg/L and 3.12μg/g crea/5.87μg/g crea, and the BMDL-05 was 0.72μg/L/1.35μg/L and 2.14μg/g crea/3.99μg/g crea. The BMD of UCd in people over 60years old was much lower than that of people less than 60years old. BMD value was related with ages and effects biomarkers. Our data showed that BMD of UCd associated with osteoporosis was lower than that previously estimated.
8667211	Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs activate carbonic anhydrase by a direct mechanism of action.	"Previous studies by this research team proved that vasodilating prostaglandins (PGs) E1, E2 and I2 inhibit carbonic anhydrase (CA) in vitro and in vivo, which suggested involvement of CA in gastric acid secretion inhibition and the increase of gastric mucosa blood flow produced by this group of PGs. Relying on these findings, as well as on our clinical observations, we studied in vitro and in vivo the effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on CA I and CA II. We also followed in vitro the effects on these isozymes of NSAIDs associated to histamine, Ca, PGE2 and acetazolamide. The results show that the NSAIDs used here, which reduce the activity of cyclooxygenase and PG production, activated CA I and CA II in a dose-dependent manner by a mechanism of the noncompetitive type. Histamine and Ca added to NSAIDs amplified the activating effect of the latter on CA II. Association of PGE2 or acetazolamide to NSAIDs reduced NSAID-induced activation of CA I and CA II. Indomethacin abolished the inhibitory effect of acetazolamide on CA I and CA II. Our data imply that between CA and cyclooxygenase there is an inverse relationship, CA activation being accompanied by reduction of cyclooxygenase activity, a reduction achieved by the pH modifications induced by CA activation. In this way, cyclooxygenase, inhibition occurs ""via CA,"" with the pH variations it brings about."
23542147	Ethanol extract of Adiantum capillus-veneris L. suppresses the production of inflammatory mediators by inhibiting NF-κB activation.	ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Adiantum capillus-veneris L. is a wildly distributed plant species and has been extensively used in south of China as traditional folk medicine for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of ethanolic extracts of Adiantum capillus-veneris L. and the involvement of NF-κB signaling in the regulation of inflammation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The plant ethanolic extracts were initially tested against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in RAW264.7 mouse macrophages, and interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production in human U937 monocytes. The effect of the plant extracts on the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway was evaluated in TNF-α stimulated HepG2 cells by luciferase gene reporter assay and Western blotting at the transcriptional and translational levels. Subsequently, the inhibition of NF-κB downstream gene expression (IL-8 and ICAM-1) by the plant extracts was assessed via quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Lastly, the anti-inflammatory activities of the plant extracts in vivo were evaluated by testing spleen index and NF-κB related protein expression in LPS-stimulated CD1 mice. RESULTS: The plant ethanolic extracts effectively suppressed PGE2, IL-6 and TNF release with an IC50 less than 50μg/ml. Moreover, luciferase expression could be specifically blocked in HepG2 cells, not in HEK293 cells, showing that the plant extracts displayed a cell-specific pattern on NF-κB gene transcription. The assayed biological activity also depended on the order of adding TNF-α and the plant extracts because the plant extracts could only block the NF-κB activation if added earlier but were unable to stop the signal when added after TNF-α. However, the plant extracts did not exert any effect on ubiquitination which regulates several steps in the NF-κB pathway. Additionally, the plant extracts down-regulated phosphorylation of IKKα/β at S176/180, p38 at T180/Y182 and p65 at S536, but not p65 at S276. This was confirmed by their ability to selectively abrogate the induction of IL-8 transcription, whereas the ICAM-1 gene, which is not transcribed selectively by an NF-κB complex containing a form of p65 phosphorylated on Ser536, did not change. Finally, the plant extracts at 200μg/mg could normalize the LPS-induced elevation of spleen index as well as NF-κB and p38 activations in CD1 mice. CONCLUSION: The present studies presents the potential utilization of this plant extracts, as a natural resources for the development of an anti-inflammatory medicine.
17521299	Cyclooxygenase inhibition attenuates 3-nitropropionic acid-induced neurotoxicity in rats: possible antioxidant mechanisms.	Systemic administration of 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP), a complex II inhibitor of the electron transport chain, causes motor and cognitive deficits that are associated with excitotoxicity and excessive free radical generation. Recently, cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors have been implicated as a neuroprotectant in the treatment of various neurological disorders. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of COX inhibitors in 3-NP-induced cognitive impairment and oxidative stress in rats. Intraperitoneal administration of 3-NP (20 mg/kg for 4 days) showed motor abnormalities and cognitive impairment in rats. Chronic treatment with naproxen (10 and 20 mg/kg) and valdecoxib (5 and 10 mg/kg) once daily for a period of 8 days beginning 4 days prior to 3-NP administration significantly improved 3-NP-induced motor and cognitive impairment in rats. Biochemical analysis revealed that systemic 3-NP administration significantly increased lipid peroxidation and nitrite levels, depleted reduced glutathione levels and reduced succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity in the brains of rats, whereas administration of naproxen, a nonselective COX inhibitor (10 and 20 mg/kg p.o.) and valdecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor (5 and 10 mg/kg p.o.) significantly attenuated 3-NP-induced oxidative stress. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors also significantly restored the decreased SDH activity. The results of the present study clearly indicate that naproxen and valdecoxib showed protection against 3-NP-induced motor and cognitive impairment by decreasing oxidative stress.
15574747	Acid-induced pain and its modulation in humans.	Despite the discovery of ion channels that are activated by protons, we still know relatively little about the signaling of acid pain. We used a novel technique, iontophoresis of protons, to investigate acid-induced pain in human volunteers. We found that transdermal iontophoresis of protons consistently caused moderate pain that was dose-dependent. A marked desensitization occurred with persistent stimulation, with a time constant of approximately 3 min. Recovery from desensitization occurred slowly, over many hours. Acid-induced pain was significantly augmented in skin sensitized by acute topical application of capsaicin. However, skin desensitized by repeated capsaicin application showed no significant reduction in acid-induced pain, suggesting that both capsaicin-sensitive and insensitive sensory neurons contribute to acid pain. Furthermore, topical application of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) significantly attenuated acid-evoked pain but did not affect the heat pain threshold, suggesting a specific interaction between NSAIDs and peripheral acid sensors. Subcutaneous injection of amiloride (1 mm) also significantly inhibited the pain induced by iontophoresis of acid, suggesting an involvement of acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC) receptors. Conversely, iontophoresis of acid over a wide range of skin temperatures from 4 to 40 degrees C produced only minor changes in the induced pain. Together these data suggest a prominent role for ASIC channels and only a minor role for transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor-1 as mediators of cutaneous acid-induced pain.
8647296	Molecular cloning of a levocabastine-sensitive neurotensin binding site.	A search for sequences homologous to the neurotensin receptor cDNA in a rat hypothalamic library has identified a novel neurotensin receptor (NTR-2). The 1539 bp cDNA encodes a 416 amino acid protein and shows highest homology to the previously cloned neurotensin receptor (NTR-1) (64% homology and 43% identity). Binding and pharmacological studies demonstrate that NTR-2 expressed in COS cells recognizes neurotensin (NT) with high affinity as well as several other agonists and antagonists. However, a fundamental difference was found; unlike NTR-1, NTR-2 recognizes, with high affinity, levocabastine, a histamine H1 receptor antagonist previously shown to compete with NT for low-affinity binding sites in brain.
23129806	Fat body dSir2 regulates muscle mitochondrial physiology and energy homeostasis nonautonomously and mimics the autonomous functions of dSir2 in muscles.	Sir2 is an evolutionarily conserved NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase which has been shown to play a critical role in glucose and fat metabolism. In this study, we have perturbed Drosophila Sir2 (dSir2) expression, bidirectionally, in muscles and the fat body. We report that dSir2 plays a critical role in insulin signaling, glucose homeostasis, and mitochondrial functions. Importantly, we establish the nonautonomous functions of fat body dSir2 in regulating mitochondrial physiology and insulin signaling in muscles. We have identified a novel interplay between dSir2 and dFOXO at an organismal level, which involves Drosophila insulin-like peptide (dILP)-dependent insulin signaling. By genetic perturbations and metabolic rescue, we provide evidence to illustrate that fat body dSir2 mediates its effects on the muscles via free fatty acids (FFA) and dILPs (from the insulin-producing cells [IPCs]). In summary, we show that fat body dSir2 is a master regulator of organismal energy homeostasis and is required for maintaining the metabolic regulatory network across tissues.
17462829	Sex differences in ACTH pulsatility following metyrapone blockade in patients with major depression.	Numerous studies suggest that increased central drive to the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis occurs in patients with major depression. To determine if increased central drive occurs throughout the 24 h, we evaluated ACTH secretion under metyrapone blockade of cortisol production. We collected blood every 10 min for measurement of ACTH and data were analyzed for ACTH pulsatility using the pulse detection algorithm deconvolution. We studied 28 patients with major depression and 28 age and sex-matched control subjects, of which 9 pairs were men and 19 pairs were women. We found a significant group x sex interaction with number of ACTH pulses (p=0.04); depressed men showed more ACTH pulses over 24h than matched control men (p=0.02). There was also a significant sex difference in AUC pulses with men showing a smaller AUC ACTH than women. Previous analyses of these data with RM-ANOVA showed a smaller ACTH response in depressed men compared to control men. These data suggest that pulsatility and mean ACTH levels are examining different aspects of HPA axis function, and that the types of HPA axis dysregulation in depression may differ between men and women.
20566645	Predicting cardiomyopathic phenotypes by altering Ca2+ affinity of cardiac troponin C.	Cardiac diseases associated with mutations in troponin subunits include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM). Altered calcium handling in these diseases is evidenced by changes in the Ca(2+) sensitivity of contraction. Mutations in the Ca(2+) sensor, troponin C (TnC), were generated to increase/decrease the Ca(2+) sensitivity of cardiac skinned fibers to create the characteristic effects of DCM, HCM, and RCM. We also used a reconstituted assay to determine the mutation effects on ATPase activation and inhibition. One mutant (A23Q) was found with HCM-like properties (increased Ca(2+) sensitivity of force and normal levels of ATPase inhibition). Three mutants (S37G, V44Q, and L48Q) were identified with RCM-like properties (a large increase in Ca(2+) sensitivity, partial loss of ATPase inhibition, and increased basal force). Two mutations were identified (E40A and I61Q) with DCM properties (decreased Ca(2+) sensitivity, maximal force recovery, and activation of the ATPase at high [Ca(2+)]). Steady-state fluorescence was utilized to assess Ca(2+) affinity in isolated cardiac (c)TnCs containing F27W and did not necessarily mirror the fiber Ca(2+) sensitivity. Circular dichroism of mutant cTnCs revealed a trend where increased alpha-helical content correlated with increased Ca(2+) sensitivity in skinned fibers and vice versa. The main findings from this study were as follows: 1) cTnC mutants demonstrated distinct functional phenotypes reminiscent of bona fide HCM, RCM, and DCM mutations; 2) a region in cTnC associated with increased Ca(2+) sensitivity in skinned fibers was identified; and 3) the F27W reporter mutation affected Ca(2+) sensitivity, maximal force, and ATPase activation of some mutants.
8302852	A cocaine-sensitive Drosophila serotonin transporter: cloning, expression, and electrophysiological characterization.	A cocaine-sensitive, high-affinity Drosophila serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5HT) transporter cDNA, denoted dSERT1, was isolated and characterized in oocytes. dSERT1 shows little transport of other monoamines and is Na+ and Cl- dependent. Sequence analysis indicates 12 putative transmembrane domains and strong homologies (approximately 50%) among dSERT1 and mammalian 5HT, norepinephrine, and dopamine transporters. Interestingly, the pharmacological properties of dSERT1, including sensitivity to antidepressants, are more similar to those of mammalian catecholamine transporters than to mammalian 5HT transporters. Two-electrode voltage-clamp analysis demonstrated 5HT-induced, voltage-dependent currents. Cloning and characterization of dSERT1 adds significantly to our knowledge of the diversity of 5HT transporters with regard to primary sequence, pharmacological profile, and permeation properties.
23347089	The influence of endocrine disruptors in a selected population of infertile women.	Abstract Several studies report that endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC) able to interfere with endocrine homeostasis may affect women's reproductive health. We analyzed EDC serum levels and nuclear receptors (NRs) expression in order to have an indication of the internal dose of biologically active compounds and a measurement of indicators of their effects, as a result of the repeated uptake from environmental source. The percentage of patients with detectable bisphenol A (BPA) concentrations was significantly higher in the infertile patients compared with fertile subjects. No significant difference was found between the groups with regard to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), mono-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP) and di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) concentrations. Among infertile women, the mean expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and beta (Erβ), androgen receptor (AR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) was significantly higher than fertile patients. The mean expression of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) did not show significant differences between two groups. Patients with endometriosis had higher levels of PPARγ than all women with other causes of infertility. This study led further support to EDC exposure as a risk factor for women's fertility.
23388095	Prolyl-hydroxylase inhibition preserves endothelial cell function in a rat model of vascular ischemia reperfusion injury.	Storage protocols of vascular grafts need further improvement against ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. Hypoxia elicits a variety of complex cellular responses by altering the activity of many signaling pathways, such as the oxygen-dependent prolyl-hyroxylase domain-containing enzyme (PHD). Reduction of PHD activity during hypoxia leads to stabilization and accumulation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) 1α. We examined the effects of PHD inhibiton by dimethyloxalylglycine on the vasomotor responses of isolated rat aorta and aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in a model of cold ischemia/warm reperfusion. Aortic segments underwent 24 hours of cold ischemic preservation in saline or DMOG (dimethyloxalylglycine)-supplemented saline solution. We investigated endothelium-dependent and -independent vasorelaxations. To simulate IR injury, hypochlorite (NaOCl) was added during warm reperfusion. VSMCs were incubated in NaCl or DMOG solution at 4°C for 24 hours after the medium was changed for a supplied standard medium at 37°C for 6 hours. Apoptosis was assessed using the TUNEL method. Gene expression analysis was performed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Cold ischemic preservation and NaOCl induced severe endothelial dysfunction, which was significantly improved by DMOG supplementation (maximal relaxation of aortic segments to acetylcholine: control 95% ± 1% versus NaOCl 44% ± 4% versus DMOG 68% ± 5%). Number of TUNEL-positive cell nuclei was significantly higher in the NaOCl group, and DMOG treatment significantly decreased apoptosis. Inducible heme-oxygenase 1 mRNA expressions were significantly higher in the DMOG group. Pharmacological modulation of oxygen sensing system by DMOG in an in vitro model of vascular IR effectively preserved endothelial function. Inhibition of PHDs could therefore be a new therapeutic avenue for protecting endothelium and vascular muscle cells against IR injury.
10898598	Phosphoacetylcholinesterase: toxicity of phosphorus oxychloride to mammals and insects that can be attributed to selective phosphorylation of acetylcholinesterase by phosphorodichloridic acid.	Phosphorus oxychloride (POCl(3)) is an intermediate in the synthesis of many organophosphorus insecticides and chemical warfare nerve gases that are toxic to insects and mammals by inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. It was therefore surprising to observe that POCl(3), which is hydrolytically unstable, also itself gives poisoning signs in ip-treated mice and fumigant-exposed houseflies similar to those produced by the organophosphorus ester insecticides and chemical warfare agents. In mice, POCl(3) inhibits serum butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) at a sublethal dose and muscle but not brain AChE at a lethal dose. In houseflies, POCl(3)-induced brain AChE inhibition is correlated with poisoning and the probable cause thereof. POCl(3) in vitro is selective for AChE (IC(50) = 12-36 microM) compared with several other serine hydrolases (BuChE, carboxylesterase, elastase, alpha-chymotrypsin, and thrombin) (IC(50) = 88-2000 microM). With electric eel AChE, methylcarbamoylation of the active site with eserine reversibly protects against subsequent irreversible inhibition by POCl(3). Most importantly, POCl(3)-induced electric eel AChE inhibition prevents postlabeling with [(3)H]diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate; i.e., both compounds phosphorylate at Ser-200 in the catalytic triad. Pyridine-2-aldoxime methiodide does not reactivate POCl(3)-inhibited AChE, consistent with an anionic phosphoserine residue at the esteratic site. The actual phosphorylating agent is formed within seconds from POCl(3) in water, has a half-life of approximately 2 min, and is identified as phosphorodichloridic acid [HOP(O)Cl(2)] by (31)P NMR and derivatization with dimethylamine to HOP(O)(NMe(2))(2). POCl(3) on reaction with water and HOP(O)Cl(2) have the same potency for inhibition of AChE from either electric eel or housefly head as well as the same toxicity for mice. In summary, the acute toxicity of POCl(3) is attributable to hydrolytic activation to HOP(O)Cl(2) that phosphorylates AChE at the active site to form enzymatically inactive [O-phosphoserine]AChE.
23587021	The tail wagging the dog - regulation of lipid metabolism by protein kinase C.	Upon their discovery almost 40 years ago, isoforms of the lipid-activated protein kinase C (PKC) family were initially regarded only as downstream effectors of the second messengers calcium and diacylglycerol, undergoing activation upon phospholipid hydrolysis in response to acute stimuli. Subsequently, several isoforms were found to be associated with the inhibitory effects of lipid over-supply on glucose homeostasis, especially the negative cross-talk with insulin signal transduction, observed upon accumulation of diacylglycerol in insulin target tissues. The PKC family has therefore attracted much attention in diabetes and obesity research, because intracellular lipid accumulation is strongly correlated with defective insulin action and the development of type 2 diabetes. Causal roles for various isoforms in the generation of insulin resistance have more recently been confirmed using PKC-deficient mice. However, during characterization of these animals, it became increasingly evident that the enzymes play key roles in the modulation of lipid metabolism itself, and may control the supply of lipids between tissues such as adipose and liver. Molecular studies have also demonstrated roles for PKC isoforms in several aspects of lipid metabolism, such as adipocyte differentiation and hepatic lipogenesis. While the precise mechanisms involved, especially the identities of protein substrates, are still unclear, the emerging picture suggests that the currently held view of the contribution of PKC isoforms to metabolism is an over-simplification. Although PKCs may inhibit insulin signal transduction, these enzymes are not merely downstream effectors of lipid accumulation, but in fact control the fate of fatty acids, thus the tail wags the dog.
17012403	Calcium entry mediated by GLR3.3, an Arabidopsis glutamate receptor with a broad agonist profile.	The amino acids glutamate (Glu) and glycine (Gly) trigger large, rapid rises in cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration and a concomitant rise in membrane potential (depolarization) in plants. The possibility that plant homologs of neuronal ionotropic glutamate receptors mediate these neuron-like ionic responses was tested in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seedlings using a combination of Ca(2+) measurements, electrophysiology, and reverse genetics. The membrane depolarization triggered by Glu was greatly reduced or completely blocked in some conditions by mutations in GLR3.3, one of the 20 GLR genes in Arabidopsis. The same mutations completely blocked the associated rise in cytosolic Ca(2+). These results genetically demonstrate the participation of a glutamate receptor in the rapid ionic responses to an amino acid. The GLR3.3-independent component of the depolarization required Glu concentrations above 25 mum, did not display desensitization, and was strongly suppressed by increasing extracellular pH. It is suggested to result from H(+)-amino acid symport. Six amino acids commonly present in soils (Glu, Gly, alanine, serine, asparagine, and cysteine) as well as the tripeptide glutathione (gamma-glutamyl-cysteinyl-Gly) were found to be strong agonists of the GLR3.3-mediated responses. All other amino acids induced a small depolarization similar to the non-GLR, putative symporter component and in most cases evoked little or no Ca(2+) rise. From these results it may be concluded that sensing of six amino acids in the rhizosphere and perhaps extracellular peptides is coupled to Ca(2+) signaling through a GLR-dependent mechanism homologous to a fundamental component of neuronal signaling.
23473037	Identification of a SIRT1 mutation in a family with type 1 diabetes.	Type 1 diabetes is caused by autoimmune-mediated β cell destruction leading to insulin deficiency. The histone deacetylase SIRT1 plays an essential role in modulating several age-related diseases. Here we describe a family carrying a mutation in the SIRT1 gene, in which all five affected members developed an autoimmune disorder: four developed type 1 diabetes, and one developed ulcerative colitis. Initially, a 26-year-old man was diagnosed with the typical features of type 1 diabetes, including lean body mass, autoantibodies, T cell reactivity to β cell antigens, and a rapid dependence on insulin. Direct and exome sequencing identified the presence of a T-to-C exchange in exon 1 of SIRT1, corresponding to a leucine-to-proline mutation at residue 107. Expression of SIRT1-L107P in insulin-producing cells resulted in overproduction of nitric oxide, cytokines, and chemokines. These observations identify a role for SIRT1 in human autoimmunity and unveil a monogenic form of type 1 diabetes.
23478800	Cucurbitacin I inhibits rac1 activation in breast cancer cells by a reactive oxygen species-mediated mechanism and independently of janus tyrosine kinase 2 and p-rex1.	The small GTPase Rac1 has been widely implicated in mammary tumorigenesis and metastasis. Previous studies established that stimulation of ErbB receptors in breast cancer cells activates Rac1 and enhances motility via the Rac-guanine nucleotide exchange factor P-Rex1. As the Janus tyrosine kinase 2 (Jak2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) pathway has been shown to be functionally associated with ErbB receptors, we asked if this pathway could mediate P-Rex1/Rac1 activation in response to ErbB ligands. Here we found that the anticancer agent cucurbitacin I, a Jak2 inhibitor, reduced the activation of Rac1 and motility in response to the ErbB3 ligand heregulin in breast cancer cells. However, Rac1 activation was not affected by Jak2 or Stat3 RNA interference, suggesting that the effect of cucurbitacin I occurs through a Jak2-independent mechanism. Cucurbitacin I also failed to affect the activation of P-Rex1 by heregulin. Subsequent analysis revealed that cucurbitacin I strongly activates RhoA and the Rho effector Rho kinase (ROCK) in breast cancer cells and induces the formation of stress fibers. Interestingly, disruption of the RhoA-ROCK pathway prevented the inhibitory effect of cucurbitacin I on Rac1 activation by heregulin. Lastly, we found that RhoA activation by cucurbitacin I is mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ROS scavenger N-acetyl l-cysteine and the mitochondrial antioxidant Mito-TEMPO rescued the inhibitory effect of cucurbitacin I on Rac1 activation. In conclusion, these results indicate that ErbB-driven Rac1 activation in breast cancer cells proceeds independently of the Jak2 pathway. Moreover, they established that the inhibitory effect of cucurbitacin I on Rac1 activity involves the alteration of the balance between Rho and Rac.
23403203	Antofine-induced connexin43 gap junction disassembly in rat astrocytes involves protein kinase Cβ.	Antofine, a phenanthroindolizidine alkaloid derived from Cryptocaryachinensis and Ficusseptica in the Asclepiadaceae milkweed family, is cytotoxic for various cancer cell lines. In this study, we demonstrated that treatment of rat primary astrocytes with antofine induced dose-dependent inhibition of gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC), as assessed by scrape-loading 6-carboxyfluorescein dye transfer. Levels of Cx43 protein were also decreased in a dose- and time-dependent manner following antofine treatment. Double-labeling immunofluorescence microscopy showed that antofine (10ng/ml) induced endocytosis of surface gap junctions into the cytoplasm, where Cx43 was co-localized with the early endosome marker EEA1. Inhibition of lysosomes or proteasomes by co-treatment with antofine and their respective specific inhibitors, NH4Cl or MG132, partially inhibited the antofine-induced decrease in Cx43 protein levels, but did not inhibit the antofine-induced inhibition of GJIC. After 30min of treatment, antofine induced a rapid increase in the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration and activation of protein kinase C (PKC)α/βII, which was maintained for at least 6h. Co-treatment of astrocytes with antofine and the intracellular Ca(2+) chelator BAPTA-AM prevented downregulation of Cx43 and inhibition of GJIC. Moreover, co-treatment with antofine and a specific PKCβ inhibitor prevented endocytosis of gap junctions, downregulation of Cx43, and inhibition of GJIC. Taken together, these findings indicate that antofine induces Cx43 gap junction disassembly by the PKCβ signaling pathway. Inhibition of GJIC by antofine may undermine the neuroprotective effect of astrocytes in CNS.
23500659	Role of the phytoestrogenic, pro-apoptotic and anti-oxidative properties of silymarin in inhibiting experimental benign prostatic hyperplasia in rats.	Androgen and estrogen play an important role in the pathogenesis of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Estrogen exerts its action through two distinct estrogen receptors (ERs) either ER-α or ER-β. The phytoestrogenic property of silymarin (SIL) has been previously characterized. Thus, this study examined the protective effect of SIL against testosterone-induced BPH in rats. In an initial dose-response study, SIL in a dose of 50mg/kg was the most effective in preventing the rise in prostate weight, prostate weight/body weight ratio and histopathologic changes induced by testosterone. Testosterone significantly decreased ER-β and increased ER-α and AR expressions as compared to the control group and these effects were significantly ameliorated by SIL. Furthermore, SIL significantly protected against testosterone-provoked decline in mRNA expression of P21(WAF1/Cip1) and Bax/Bcl-xl ratio as well as caspase-3 activity. SIL minimized the number of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) positive cells as compared to testosterone-treated group. Moreover, SIL significantly blunted the inducible NF-κB expression and restored the oxidative status to within normal values in the prostatic tissues. Collectively these findings elucidate the effectiveness of SIL in preventing testosterone-induced BPH in rats. This could be attributed, at least partly, to its phytoestrogenic, pro-apoptotic and anti-oxidative properties.
23639191	Involvement of p-CREB and phase II detoxifying enzyme system in neuroprotection mediated by the flavonoid calycopterin isolated from Dracocephalum kotschyi.	PURPOSE: There is an increasing amount of experimental evidence that oxidative stress has a central role in the neuropathology of neurodegenerative diseases. It has been suggested that the loss of cell function results from the increased oxidative damage to proteins and DNA. Herein, we investigated the effect of a natural neuroprotective flavonoid, calycopterin, on H2O2-induced disruption of phase II detoxifying enzyme system and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation. METHODS: PC12 cells were treated with 25, 50 and 100μM of calycopterin for 3h, followed by adding H2O2 (150μM) for 24h. The extent of apoptosis was assessed by comet assay. The level of phosphorylated CREB, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) were measured by western blot method. The concentration of glutathione (GSH) was determined in whole cell lysate using dithionitrobenzoic acid method. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was measured by colorimetric assay. RESULT: Morphological analysis of protection induced by calycopterin, determined by comet assay, showed that calycopterin reduced DNA in tail. We found that H2O2 decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), while, calycopterin prevented this decrease in MMP in presence of H2O2. In H2O2-treated cells, calycopterin also suppressed cytochrome C release to cytosol that is necessary for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis in survived cells. Moreover, calycopterin, in presence of H2O2 inhibited the decrease caused by oxidative stress in stress-sensing transcription factors, CREB and Nrf2, which play an important role in antioxidant capacity of the cell. There was also an increase in γ-GCS and HO-1 levels in calycopterin pretreated cells. In the presence of H2O2, calycopterin inhibited decrease in GSH level and SOD activity. CONCLUSION: We provided documentation of neuroprotective effect of a natural flavone, calycopterin, against H2O2-induced oxidative stress in differentiated PC12 cells by modulating the level of CREB phosphorylation and Nrf2 pathway.
12085361	Interactions of rifamycin SV and rifampicin with organic anion uptake systems of human liver.	The antibiotics rifamycin SV and rifampicin substantially reduce sulfobromophthalein (BSP) elimination in humans. In rats, rifamycin SV and rifampicin were shown to interfere with hepatic organic anion uptake by inhibition of the organic anion transporting polypeptides Oatp1 and Oatp2. Therefore, we investigated the effects of rifamycin SV and rifampicin on the OATPs of human liver and determined whether rifampicin is a substrate of 1 or several of these carriers. In complementary RNA (cRNA)-injected Xenopus laevis oocytes, rifamycin SV (10 micromol/L) cis-inhibited human organic anion transporting polypeptide C (SLC21A6) (OATP-C), human organic anion transporting polypeptide 8 (SLC21A8) (OATP8), human organic anion transporting polypeptide B (SLC21A9) (OATP-B), and human organic anion transporting polypeptide A (SLC21A3) (OATP-A) mediated BSP uptake by 69%, 79%, 89%, and 57%, respectively, as compared with uptake into control oocytes. In the presence of 100 micromol/L rifamycin SV, BSP uptake was almost completely abolished. Approximate K(i) values were 2 micromol/L for OATP-C, 3 micromol/L for OATP8, 3 micromol/L for OATP-B and 11 micromol/L for OATP-A. Rifampicin (10 micromol/L) inhibited OATP8-mediated BSP uptake by 50%, whereas inhibition of OATP-C-, OATP-B-, and OATP-A-mediated BSP transport was below 15%. 100 micromol/L rifampicin inhibited OATP-C- and OATP8-, OATP-B- and OATP-A-mediated BSP uptake by 66%, 96%, 25%, and 49%, respectively. The corresponding K(i) values were 17 micromol/L for OATP-C, 5 micromol/L for OATP8, and 51 micromol/L for OATP-A. Direct transport of rifampicin could be shown for OATP-C (apparent K(m) value 13 micromol/L) and OATP8 (2.3 micromol/L). In conclusion, these results show that rifamycin SV and rifampicin interact with OATP-mediated substrate transport to different extents. Inhibition of human liver OATPs can explain the previously observed effects of rifamycin SV and rifampicin on hepatic organic anion elimination.
23587649	Acute and chronic interference with BDNF/TrkB-signaling impair LTP selectively at mossy fiber synapses in the CA3 region of mouse hippocampus.	Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling via TrkB crucially regulates synaptic plasticity in the brain. Although BDNF is abundant at hippocampal mossy fiber (MF) synapses, which critically contribute to hippocampus dependent memory, its role in MF synaptic plasticity (long-term potentiation, LTP) remained largely unclear. Using field potential recordings in CA3 of adult heterozygous BDNF knockout (ko, BDNF+/-) mice we observed impaired (∼50%) NMDAR-independent MF-LTP. In contrast to MF synapses, LTP at neighboring associative/commissural (A/C) fiber synapses remained unaffected. To exclude that impaired MF-LTP in BDNF+/- mice was due to developmental changes in response to chronically reduced BDNF levels, and to prove the importance of acute availability of BDNF in MF-LTP, we also tested effects of acute interference with BDNF/TrkB signaling. Inhibition of TrkB tyrosine kinase signaling with k252a, or with the selective BDNF scavenger TrkB-Fc, both inhibited MF-LTP to the same extent as observed in BDNF+/- mice. Basal synaptic transmission, short-term plasticity, and synaptic fatigue during LTP induction were not significantly altered by treatment with k252a or TrkB-Fc, or by chronic BDNF reduction in BDNF+/- mice. Since the acute interference with BDNF-signaling did not completely block MF-LTP, our results provide evidence that an additional mechanism besides BDNF induced TrkB signaling contributes to this type of LTP. Our results prove for the first time a mechanistic action of acute BDNF/TrkB signaling in presynaptic expression of MF-LTP in adult hippocampus.
23117151	Androgen receptor CAG repeat length modifies the effect of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin on receptor activity in human prostate cells.	Increased incidence of prostate cancer has been reported in men exposed to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). TCDD acts through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which interacts with the androgen receptor (AR). The AR gene contains a polymorphic CAG repeat that influences its transcriptional activity. We investigated the influence of TCDD on prostate cancer cells (PC-3) and non-tumor prostate cells (PNT1A) on 5α-dihydrotestosterone-activated ARs containing CAG repeats within normal length range (16, 22, and 28). The AhR target gene CYP1A1 mRNA expression was induced by TCDD, but was not affected by the AR CAG length. TCDD had no effect on AR activity in PC-3 cells, whereas the shortest AR variant was induced by TCDD in PNT1A cells. In conclusion, the CAG length dependent effect of TCDD on AR activity in PNT1A, but not in PC-3 cells, indicates as a cell-specific effect of TCDD on AR activity.
9633680	Mechanism of action of dopaminergic agents in Parkinson's disease.	As the substantia nigra degenerates in Parkinson's disease (PD), the nigrostriatal pathway is disrupted, reducing striatal dopamine and producing PD symptoms. Although dopamine does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier, its precursor, levodopa, does. Levodopa is absorbed in the small bowel and is rapidly catabolized by aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase (AADC) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). Because gastric AADC and COMT degrade levodopa, the drug is given with inhibitors of AADC (carbidopa or benserazide), and inhibitors of COMT will also enter clinical use. Although the exact site of decarboxylation of exogenous levodopa to dopamine in the brain is unknown, most striatal AADC is located in nigrostriatal dopaminergic nerve terminals. Newly synthesized dopamine is stored in the terminals and then released, stimulating postsynaptic dopamine receptors and mediating the antiparkinsonian action of levodopa. Dopamine agonists act directly on postsynaptic dopamine receptors, thus obviating the need for metabolic conversion, storage, and release. How the actions of dopaminergic drugs produce side effects and how these side effects should be managed are discussed.
23598363	Rescue of platinum-damaged oocytes from programmed cell death through inactivation of the p53 family signaling network.	Non-proliferating oocytes within avascular regions of the ovary are exquisitely susceptible to chemotherapy. Early menopause and sterility are unintended consequences of chemotherapy, and efforts to understand the oocyte apoptotic pathway may provide new targets for mitigating this outcome. Recently, the c-Abl kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (imatinib) has become the focus of research as a fertoprotective drug against cisplatin. However, the mechanism by which imatinib protects oocytes is not fully understood, and reports of the drug's efficacy have been contradictory. Using in vitro culture and subrenal grafting of mouse ovaries, we demonstrated that imatinib inhibits the cisplatin-induced apoptosis of oocytes within primordial follicles. We found that, before apoptosis, cisplatin induces c-Abl and TAp73 expression in the oocyte. Oocytes undergoing apoptosis showed downregulation of TAp63 and upregulation of Bax. While imatinib was unable to block cisplatin-induced DNA damage and damage response, such as the upregulation of p53, imatinib inhibited the cisplatin-induced nuclear accumulation of c-Abl/TAp73 and the subsequent downregulation of TAp63 and upregulation of Bax, thereby abrogating oocyte cell death. Surprisingly, the conditional deletion of Trp63, but not ΔNp63, in oocytes inhibited apoptosis, as well as the accumulation of c-Abl and TAp73 caused by cisplatin. These data suggest that TAp63 is the master regulator of cisplatin-induced oocyte death. The expression kinetics of TAp63, c-Abl and TAp73 suggest that cisplatin activates TAp63-dependent expression of c-Abl and TAp73 and, in turn, the activation of TAp73 by c-Abl-induced BAX expression. Our findings indicate that imatinib protects oocytes from cisplatin-induced cell death by inhibiting c-Abl kinase, which would otherwise activate TAp73-BAX-mediated apoptosis. Thus, imatinib and other c-Abl kinase inhibitors provide an intriguing new way to halt cisplatin-induced oocyte death in early follicles and perhaps conserve the endocrine function of the ovary against chemotherapy.Cell Death and Differentiation advance online publication, 19 April 2013; doi:10.1038/cdd.2013.31.
23052191	Repeat oral dose toxicity studies of melamine in rats and monkeys.	Melamine is an important and widely used organic industrial chemical. Recently, clinical findings of renal failure and kidney stones in infants have been associated with ingestion of melamine-contaminated infant formula. To understand the toxicity and clinical outcome of melamine exposure, repeated oral dose studies in rats and monkeys were performed to characterize the subchronic toxicity of melamine. Assessment of toxicity was based on mortality, clinical signs, body weights, ophthalmic findings, clinical pathology, gross pathology, organ weights, and microscopic observations. The first rat study was intended to be a 14-day oral study followed by an 8-day recovery period. The dose levels were 140, 700, and 1,400 mg/kg/day (lowered to 1,000 mg/kg/day subsequently due to mortality). Oral administration of melamine at 700 mg/kg/day for 14 consecutive days in rats produced compound-related clinical signs (red urine), decreased body weights, and changes in clinical pathology (increased serum urea nitrogen and creatinine) and anatomical pathology (renal tubular cell debris, crystal deposition, and hyperactive regeneration of renal tubular epithelium). The kidney was identified as the target organ. Oral administration at 1,400 mg/kg/day (subsequently lowered to 1,000 mg/kg/day) resulted in animal death and moribundity. There were no treatment-related findings in the 140 mg/kg/day group. There were no compound-related findings in the high-dose recovery animals. The second rat study was a 5-day oral toxicity study with genomic biomarkers assayed in the kidney tissues. At the top dose of 1,050 mg/kg/day, similar clinical and anatomical pathology findings as described above were observed. The genes measured, Kim-1, Clu, Spp1, A2m, Lcn2, Tcfrsf12a, Gpnmb, and CD44, were significantly up-regulated (fivefold to 550-fold), while Tff3 was significantly down-regulated (fivefold). These results indicated that genomic markers could sensitively diagnose melamine-induced kidney injury. A 3-month oral study with 4-week recovery in monkeys was also conducted. In this monkey study, the animals were treated with melamine at doses of 60, 200, or 700 mg/kg/day. The administration of 700 mg/kg/day melamine by nasal-gastric gavage to monkeys resulted in test article-related clinical signs including turbid and whitish urine, urine crystals, red blood cell changes, increased serum alanine aminotransferase and kidney and/or liver weights, and microscopic findings including nephrotoxicity, pericarditis, and increased hematopoiesis. Nephrotoxicity was also noted at 200 mg/kg/day. It was concluded that the kidney is the primary target organ and the NOAEL was estimated to be 140 mg/kg/day in rats following a 14-day oral administration and 60 mg/kg/day in the monkey study.
23386702	Reversible inhibition of human carboxylesterases by acyl glucuronides.	Carboxylesterases hydrolyze esters, amides, and thioesters to produce carboxylic acids and resulting alcohols, amines, and thiols, respectively. Uridine 5'-diphosphate- glucuronosyltransferases are colocalized with carboxylesterases and have the potential to further metabolize carboxylic acids to acyl glucuronides, but it is currently unknown if acyl glucuronides, being esters, also interact with carboxylesterases. Objective: This study explores the ability of acyl glucuronides to act as substrates or inhibitors of human carboxylesterases 1 (hCES1) and 2 (hCES2). Methods: The stability of six acyl glucuronides in the presence of hCES1, hCES2, and buffer alone (100 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 37°C) were investigated. Reversible inhibition of 4-nitrophenyl acetate hydrolysis by the acyl glucuronides was also studied. Diclofenac-β-d-glucuronide was used to explore potential time-dependent inactivation. Results: The chemical stability half-life values for CGP 47292-β-d-glucuronide, diclofenac-β-d-glucuronide, (R)-naproxen-β-d-glucuronide, (S)-naproxen-β-d-glucuronide, ibuprofen-β-d-glucuronide (racemic), clopidogrel-β-d-glucuronide, and valproate-β-d-glucuronide were found to be 0.252, 0.537, 0.996, 1.77, 3.67, 5.02, and 15.2 hours, respectively. Diclofenac-β-d-glucuronide, clopidogrel-β-d-glucuronide, ibuprofen-β-d-glucuronide, (R)-naproxen-β-d-glucuronide, and (S)-naproxen-β-d-glucuronide selectively inhibited hCES1, with Ki values of 4.32 ± 0.47, 24.8 ± 4.2, 355 ± 38, 468 ± 21, 707 ± 64 µM, respectively, but did not significantly inhibit hCES2. Valproate-β-d-glucuronide and CGP 47292-β-d-glucuronide did not inhibit either hCES. Time-dependent inactivation of hCES1 by diclofenac-β-d-glucuronide was not observed. Lastly, both hCES1 and hCES2 were shown not to catalyze the hydrolysis of the acyl glucuronides studied. Conclusion: Drug-drug interaction studies may be warranted for drugs that metabolize to acyl glucuronides due to the potential inhibition of hCESs.
23409763	The therapeutic potential of allosteric ligands for free fatty acid sensitive GPCRs.	G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the most historically successful therapeutic targets. Despite this success there are many important aspects of GPCR pharmacology and function that have yet to be exploited to their full therapeutic potential. One in particular that has been gaining attention in recent times is that of GPCR ligands that bind to allosteric sites on the receptor distinct from the orthosteric site of the endogenous ligand. As therapeutics, allosteric ligands possess many theoretical advantages over their orthosteric counterparts, including more complex modes of action, improved safety, more physiologically appropriate responses, better target selectivity, and reduced likelihood of desensitisation and tachyphylaxis. Despite these advantages, the development of allosteric ligands is often difficult from a medicinal chemistry standpoint due to the more complex challenge of identifying allosteric leads and their often flat or confusing SAR. The present review will consider the advantages and challenges associated with allosteric GPCR ligands, and examine how the particular properties of these ligands may be exploited to uncover the therapeutic potential for free fatty acid sensitive GPCRs.
15736931	Mutation of arginine 228 to lysine enhances the glucosyltransferase activity of bovine beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase I.	Beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase I (beta4Gal-T1) normally transfers Gal from UDP-Gal to GlcNAc in the presence of Mn(2+) ion (Gal-T activity) and also transfers Glc from UDP-Glc to GlcNAc (Glc-T activity), albeit at only 0.3% efficiency. In addition, alpha-lactalbumin (LA) enhances this Glc-T activity more than 25 times. Comparison of the crystal structures of UDP-Gal- and UDP-Glc-bound beta4Gal-T1 reveals that the O4 hydroxyl group in both Gal and Glc moieties forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain carboxylate group of Glu317. The orientation of the O4 hydroxyl of glucose causes a steric hindrance to the side chain carboxylate group of Glu317, accounting for the enzyme's low Glc-T activity. In this study, we show that mutation of Arg228, a residue in the vicinity of Glu317, to lysine (R228K-Gal-T1) results in a 15-fold higher Glc-T activity, which is further enhanced by LA to nearly 25% of the Gal-T activity of the wild type. The kinetic parameters indicate that the main effect of the mutation of Arg228 to lysine is on the k(cat) of Glc-T, which increases 3-4-fold, both in the absence and in the presence of LA; simultaneously, the k(cat) for the Gal-T reaction is reduced 30-fold. The crystal structure of R228K-Gal-T1 complexed with LA, UDP-Gal, and Mn(2+) determined at 1.9 A resolution shows that the Asp318 side chain exhibits a minor alternate conformation, compared to that in the wild type. This alternate conformation now causes a steric hindrance to the O4 hydroxyl group of the Gal moiety of UDP-Gal, probably causing the dissociation of UDP-Gal and the reduced k(cat) of the Gal-T reaction.
23237450	Calcium-dependent ligand binding and G-protein signaling of family B GPCR parathyroid hormone 1 receptor purified in nanodiscs.	GPCRs mediate intracellular signaling upon external stimuli, making them ideal drug targets. However, little is known about their activation mechanisms due to the difficulty in purification. Here, we introduce a method to purify GPCRs in nanodiscs, which incorporates GPCRs into lipid bilayers immediately after membrane solubilization, followed by single-step purification. Using this approach, we purified a family B GPCR, parathyroid hormone 1 receptor (PTH1R), which regulates calcium and phosphate homeostasis and is a drug target for osteoporosis. We demonstrated that the purified PTH1R in nanodiscs can bind to PTH(1-34) and activate G protein. We also observed that Ca(2+) is a weak agonist of PTH1R, and Ca(2+) in millimolar concentration can switch PTH(1-34) from an inverse agonist to an agonist. Hence, our results show that nanodiscs are a viable vehicle for GPCR purification, enabling studies of GPCRs under precise experimental conditions without interference from other cellular or membrane components.
11246504	Cytochrome P450 4A, peroxisomal enzymes and nicotinamide cofactors in koala liver.	We have examined hepatic levels of microsomal lauric acid hydroxylase activity and cyanide-insensitive palmitoyl coenzyme A oxidative activity in koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) and tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii) and compared our results to those determined in rat. Microsomal lauric acid hydroxylation was significantly higher in koala than in tammar wallaby or rat. However, cyanide-insensitive palmitoyl-CoA oxidation was absent in the koala. We have also determined the hepatic nicotinamide cofactors in these species. Hepatic nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and the ratio of NAD/nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) were higher in koala than in tammar wallaby and rat liver. Reverse transcription of koala liver mRNA, followed by polymerase chain reaction using primers based on highly conserved areas in the CYP4A family led to the cloning of a partial, near full length, cDNA clone with approximately 70% nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence identity to human CYP4A11. The CYP has been named CYP4A15.
23165754	EphB4 enhances the process of endochondral ossification and inhibits remodeling during bone fracture repair.	Previous reports have identified a role for the tyrosine kinase receptor EphB4 and its ligand, ephrinB2, as potential mediators of both bone formation by osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts. In the present study, we examined the role of EphB4 during bone repair after traumatic injury. We performed femoral fractures with internal fixation in transgenic mice that overexpress EphB4 under the collagen type 1 promoter (Col1-EphB4) and investigated the bone repair process up to 12 weeks postfracture. The data indicated that Col1-EphB4 mice exhibited stiffer and stronger bones after fracture compared with wild-type mice. The fractured bones of Col1-EphB4 transgenic mice displayed significantly greater tissue and bone volume 2 weeks postfracture compared with that of wild-type mice. These findings correlated with increased chondrogenesis and mineral formation within the callus site at 2 weeks postfracture, as demonstrated by increased safranin O and von Kossa staining, respectively. Interestingly, Col1-EphB4 mice were found to possess significantly greater numbers of clonogenic mesenchymal stromal progenitor cells (CFU-F), with an increased capacity to form mineralized nodules in vitro under osteogenic conditions, when compared with those of the wild-type control mice. Furthermore, Col1-EphB4 mice had significantly lower numbers of TRAP-positive multinucleated osteoclasts within the callus site. Taken together, these observations suggest that EphB4 promotes endochondral ossification while inhibiting osteoclast development during callus formation and may represent a novel drug target for the repair of fractured bones.
17515952	Gene expression in temporal lobe epilepsy is consistent with increased release of glutamate by astrocytes.	Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) often have a shrunken hippocampus that is known to be the location in which seizures originate. The role of the sclerotic hippocampus in the causation and maintenance of seizures in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) has remained incompletely understood despite extensive neuropathological investigations of this substrate. To gain new insights and develop new testable hypotheses on the role of sclerosis in the pathophysiology of TLE, the differential gene expression profile was studied. To this end, DNA microarray analysis was used to compare gene expression profiles in sclerotic and non-sclerotic hippocampi surgically removed from TLE patients. Sclerotic hippocampi had transcriptional signatures that were different from non-sclerotic hippocampi. The differentially expressed gene set in sclerotic hippocampi revealed changes in several molecular signaling pathways, which included the increased expression of genes associated with astrocyte structure (glial fibrillary acidic protein, ezrin-moesin-radixin, palladin), calcium regulation (S100 calcium binding protein beta, chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4) and blood-brain barrier function (Aquaaporin 4, Chemokine (C-C- motif) ligand 2, Chemokine (C-C- motif) ligand 3, Plectin 1, intermediate filament binding protein 55kDa) and inflammatory responses. Immunohistochemical localization studies show that there is altered distribution of the gene-associated proteins in astrocytes from sclerotic foci compared with non-sclerotic foci. It is hypothesized that the astrocytes in sclerotic tissue have activated molecular pathways that could lead to enhanced release of glutamate by these cells. Such glutamate release may excite surrounding neurons and elicit seizure activity.
16207494	Age-dependent changes of pyridoxal phosphate synthesizing enzymes immunoreactivities and activities in the gerbil hippocampal CA1 region.	In the present study, age-related changes of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) synthesizing enzymes, pyridoxal kinase (PLK) and pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase (PNPO), their protein contents and activities were examined in the gerbil hippocampus proper. Significant age-dependent changes in PLK and PNPO immunoreactivities were found in the CA1 region, but not in the CA2/3 region. In the postnatal month 1 (PM 1) group, PLK and PNPO immunoreactivities were detected mainly in the stratum pyramidale of the CA1 region. PLK and PNPO immunoreactivities and their protein contents were highest in the PM 6 group, showing that many CA1 pyramidal cells had strong PLK and PNPO immunoreactivities. Thereafter, PLK and PNPO immunoreactivities started to decrease and were very low at PM 24. Alterations in the change patterns in protein contents and total activities of PLK and PNPO corresponded to the immunohistochemical data, but their specific activities were not altered in any experimental group. Based on double immunofluorescence study, PLK and PNPO immunoreactive cells in the strata oriens and radiatum were identified as GABAergic cells. Therefore, decreases of PLK and PNPO in the hippocampal CA1 region of aged brains may be involved in aging processes related with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) function.
8760245	Beta 2-adrenergic function in cultured rat proximal tubule epithelial cells.	We conducted studies to determine whether functional beta 2-adrenoceptors are present in cultured rat proximal tubule epithelial cells. To determine whether cultured cells maintain polarity with respect to sodium transport, cells were acid loaded. Acid loading resulted in stimulation of sodium transport. Exposure of acid-loaded cells to alkaline extracellular pH further enhanced sodium transport (22Na flux at pH 7.50 was 68.1 +/- 44% above pH 7.00, P < 0.05). Cultured proximal tubules also exhibited basolateral 86Rb uptake, 65% of which was ouabain sensitive. Thus cultured cells maintain apical Na/H antiport and basolateral Na-K-adenosinetriphosphatase (Na-K-ATPase). Metaproterenol (10(-6) M), a selective beta 2-agonist, stimulated Na-K-ATPase activity by 36 +/- 6% above control (P < 0.05). The stimulatory effect was blocked by ICI-118551, a selective beta 2-antagonist. To determine whether metaproterenol-dependent increases in Na-K-ATPase were dependent on apical sodium entry, apical entry was blocked with dimethylamiloride or maximized with monensin. Both dimethylamiloride and monensin prevented metaproterenol activation of Na-K-ATPase. Metaproterenol-mediated increases in Na-K-ATPase activity were associated with increases in sodium transport (27 +/- 10% above control, P < 0.05), which was prevented by dimethylamiloride. In contrast to isoproterenol, metaproterenol did not stimulate cAMP production. In summary, we have shown that functional beta 2-adrenoceptors are present on cultured rat proximal tubules. beta 2-Adrenoceptor activation results in increases in Na-K-ATPase and Na transport as a consequence of increased apical sodium entry.
23290048	Design, synthesis, characterization and biological evaluation of novel pyrazole integrated benzophenones.	A series of novel pyrazole integrated benzophenones (9a-j) have been designed, synthesized from 1-methyl-5-(2,4,6-trimethoxy-phenyl)-1H-pyrazole 6. The structures of the regioisomers 6 and 7 were determined by 2D (1)H-(1)H COSY, (1)H-(13)C HSQC and (1)H-(13)C HMBC experiments. The newly synthesized compounds (9a-j) were evaluated for in vivo anti-inflammatory activity by carrageenan paw edema in rats and in vitro COX-1/COX-2 inhibition and antioxidant potential. Among the synthesized compounds, compounds 9b, 9d and 9f, were found to be active anti-inflammatory agents in addition to having potent antioxidant activity.
15943176	In vivo effect of celecoxib and tenoxicam on oxidant/ anti-oxidant status of patients with knee osteoarthritis.	The aim of this study was to compare the in vivo effects on free radical metabolism of 2 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): tenoxicam, an oxicam preferentially cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) inhibitor, and celecoxib, a sulfonamide selective COX-2 inhibitor. The serum levels of oxidative stress-related enzymes (ie, xanthine oxidase (XO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px)), of a lipid peroxidation marker (malondialdehyde (MDA)), and of nitric oxide (NO) in patients with knee osteoarthritis were studied at baseline and after a 4-wk course of treatment with celecoxib (n = 11) and tenoxicam (n = 12). Celecoxib-treated patients had significant decrease in nitrite levels (p = 0.043), whereas SOD, XO, GSH-Px enzyme activities, and MDA levels did not change significantly compared to baseline. Tenoxicam-treated patients had significant decrease in nitrite levels (p = 0.036) and XO activity (p = 0.01), but their SOD, GSH-Px enzyme activities, and MDA levels were unchanged from baseline. There was significant correlation between the patients' (n = 23) Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) LK3.0 Osteoarthritis Index, WOMAC-pain scores, and MDA levels (r = 0.50, p = 0.014) and the patients' WOMAC-stiffness scores and XO enzyme activity (r = 0.46, p = 0.027) at baseline. Significant improvement was found in pain-VAS, patients' global assessment, and WOMAC pain, stiffness, and physical function scores in celecoxib and tenoxicam-treated groups. In summary, our study revealed that tenoxicam may have antioxidant effects, and that celecoxib and tenoxicam may reduce nitrite levels, indicating an alteration of NO pathways.
15204055	Are the cognitive effects of atypical antipsychotics influenced by their affinity to 5HT-2A receptors?	It is well documented that atypical antipsychotics have an influence on cognitive function in patients with schizophrenia, although the neurochemical basis for this effect is not well understood. One suggestion is that the effects are exerted through action on 5HT-2A receptors, which leads to changes in the level of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex. The following study explored this hypothesis by comparing the cognitive effects of the atypical antipsychotics which have a high affinity for 5HT-2A receptors, with those that have little or no affinity to these receptors. Forty-four patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia were recruited within 6 weeks of starting one of the atypical antipsychotics: clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, or amisulpride. The patients were divided into two groups according to the 5HT-2A affinity of the individual medications (high 5HT-2A affinity--clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone vs. low 5HT-2A affinity--quetiapine, amisulpride). Patients were tested on a broad range of neuropsychological measures after 9 months and 18 months of treatment. The high 5HT-2A affinity group showed a decrement in performance on tests of visual recognition memory and planning ability. In contrast, the low-5HT-2A affinity group showed improvements on these measures in addition to others. The 5HT-2A affinity of the atypical antipsychotics is an important determinant of their cognitive effects.
23173549	Xenobiotic receptor humanized mice and their utility.	The nuclear receptors pregnane X receptor, constitutive androstane receptor, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha have important endogenous functions and are also involved in the induction of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters in response to exogenous xenobiotics. Though not belonging to the same protein family, the Per-Sim-ARNT domain receptor aryl hydrocarbon receptor functionally overlaps with the three nuclear receptors in many aspects and is therefore included in this review. Significant species differences in ligand affinity and biological responses as a result of activation of these receptors have been described. Several xenobiotic receptor humanized mice have been created to overcome these species differences and to provide in vivo models that are more predictive for human responses. This review provides an overview of the different xenobiotic receptor humanized mouse models described to date and will summarize how these models can be applied in basic research and improve drug discovery and development. Some of the key applications in the evaluation of drug induction, drug-drug interactions, nongenotoxic carcinogenicity, other toxicity, or efficacy studies are described. We also discuss relevant considerations in the interpretation of such data and potential future directions for the use of xenobiotic receptor humanized mice.
23480196	Purification and sidewall functionalization of multiwalled carbon nanotubes and resulting bioactivity in two macrophage models.	"This study examined the consequences of surface carboxylation of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) on bioactivity. Since commercial raw MWCNT contain impurities that may affect their bioactivity, HCl refluxing was exploited to purify raw ""as-received"" MWCNT by removing the amorphous carbon layer on the MWCNT surface and reducing the metal impurities (e.g. Ni). The removal of amorphous carbon layer was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. Furthermore, the HCl-purified MWCNT provided more available reaction sites, leading to enhanced sidewall functionalization. The sidewall of HCl-purified MWCNT was further functionalized with the -COOH moiety by HNO(3) oxidation. This process resulted in four distinct MWCNT: raw, purified, -COOH-terminated raw MWCNT, and -COOH-terminated purified MWCNT. Freshly isolated alveolar macrophages from C57Bl/6 mice were exposed to these nanomaterials to determine the effects of the surface chemistry on the bioactivity in terms of cell viability and inflammasome activation. Inflammasome activation was confirmed using inhibitors of cathepsin B and Caspase-1. Purification reduced the cell toxicity and inflammasome activation slightly compared to raw MWCNT. In contrast, functionalization of MWCNT with the -COOH group dramatically reduced the cytotoxicity and inflammasome activation. Similar results were seen using THP-1 cells supporting their potential use for high-throughput screening. This study demonstrated that the toxicity and bioactivity of MWCNT were diminished by removal of the Ni contamination and/or addition of -COOH groups to the sidewalls."
23220614	MAPK signaling pathways regulate mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis induced by isoorientin in human hepatoblastoma cancer cells.	Isoorientin (ISO) (CAS RN: 4261-42-1) is a flavonoid compound that can be extracted from several plant species, such as Phyllostachys pubescens, Patrinia, and Drosophyllum lusitanicum. ISO is able to induce apoptosis through mitochondrial dysfunction and inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in HepG2 cells, however, the effects of ISO on MAPK signaling pathways remain unknown. The present study investigated the effects of ISO on this pathway, and the roles of MAPK kinases on mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in HepG2 cells. The results showed that ISO induced cell death in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and induction apoptosis is main cause for ISO-induced cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells. ISO significantly inhibited the levels of ERK1/2 kinase and increased the expression of JNK and p38 kinases. Furthermore, U0126 (an ERK1/2 inhibitor) significantly enhanced the ISO-induced the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, the release of cytochrome c to the cytosol fraction, and the levels of cleaved caspase-3. While SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor) and SB203580 (a p38 inhibitor) markedly prevented the expression of these proteins induced by ISO. Furthermore, the ROS inhibitor (NAC) notably promoted the inhibited effect of ISO on the ERK1/2 kinase. NAC also suppressed the p-JNK and p-p38, but failed to reverse the effects of ISO. These results demonstrated for the first time that ISO induces apoptosis in HepG2 cells through inactivating ERK1/2 kinase and activating JNK and p38 kinases, and ROS stimulated by ISO is able to activate the MAPK singaling pathway as the upstream signaling molecules. Initiating event of the mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis induced by ISO is MAPK signals.
23354728	Investigational anti-hyperglycemic agents: the future of type 2 diabetes therapy?	As the pandemic of type 2 diabetes spreads globally, clinicians face many challenges in treating an increasingly diverse patient population varying in age, comorbidities, and socioeconomic status. Current therapies for type 2 diabetes are often unable to alter the natural course of the disease and provide durable glycemic control, and side effects in the context of individual patient characteristics often limit treatment choices. This often results in the progression to insulin use and complex regimens that are difficult to maintain. Therefore, a number of agents are being developed to better address the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and to overcome limitations of current therapies. The hope is to provide more options for glucose lowering and complication reduction with less risk for hypoglycemia and other adverse effects. These agents include newer incretin-based therapies and PPAR agonists, as well as new therapeutic classes such as sodium-coupled glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, free fatty acid receptor agonists, 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 inhibitors, glucokinase activators, and several others that may enter clinical use over the next decade. Herein we review these agents that are advancing through clinical trials and describe the rationale behind their use, mechanisms of action, and potential for glucose lowering, as well as what is known of their limitations.
7912539	Cardiac effects of the beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist BRL35135 in man.	The aim of the present study was to evaluate the cardiac effects of the beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist BRL35135, and determine whether beta 3-receptors are involved in mediating chronotropic or inotropic responses in man. Eight normal males received single oral doses of BRL35135 8 mg (BRL) or the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol 8 mg (SAL), after pretreatment with either placebo (PL), bisoprolol 5 mg (B5) as a selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, or nadolol 20 mg (N20) to block beta 1- and beta 2- but not beta 3-receptors. Both BRL and SAL produced a significant increase in postural finger tremor in keeping with beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation, and this response was totally abolished by pretreatment with N20. Significant increases in systolic blood pressure and Doppler stroke distance occurred with BRL and SAL which were unaffected by pretreatment with B5 and completely blocked by N20, in keeping with beta 2-mediated effects. BRL and SAL produced significant chronotropic and minute distance responses which were unaffected by beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade. However, whereas N20 blocked these responses to SAL, a small but significant response occurred with BRL in comparison with placebo despite complete blockade of co-existing beta 2-mediated effects. Compared with PL, the mean responses to N20/BRL, and the 95% confidence interval for the differences between the means were 7.4 beats min-1 [3.2 to 11.6] (P = 0.002) for heart rate, and 208.8 cm [38.3 to 379.3] (P = 0.02) for minute distance responses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
23047912	L-BMAA induced ER stress and enhanced caspase 12 cleavage in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells at low nonexcitotoxic concentrations.	The cyanobacterial β-N-methylamino-L-alanine (L-BMAA) is described as a low-potency excitotoxin, possibly a factor in the increased incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinsonism-dementia complex (PDC) in Guam. The latter association is intensively disputed, as L-BMAA concentrations required for toxic effects exceed those assumed to occur via food. The question thus was raised whether L-BMAA leads to neurodegeneration at nonexcitotoxic conditions. Using human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, L-BMAA-transport, incorporation into proteins, and subsequent impairment of cellular protein homeostasis were investigated. Binding of L-BMAA to intracellular proteins, but no clear protein incorporation was detected in response to (14)C-L-BMAA exposures. Nevertheless, low L-BMAA concentrations (≥ 0.1mM, 48 h) increased protein ubiquitination, 20S proteasomal and caspase 12 activity, expression of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress marker CHOP, and enhanced phosphorylation of elf2α in SH-SY5Y cells. In contrast, high L-BMAA concentrations (≥ 1mM, 48 h) increased reactive oxygen species and protein oxidization, which were partially ameliorated by coincubation with vitamin E. L-BMAA-mediated cytotoxicity was observable 48 h following ≥ 2mM L-BMAA treatment. Consequently, the data presented here suggest that low L-BMAA concentrations result in a dysregulation of the cellular protein homeostasis with ensuing ER stress that is independent from high-concentration effects such as excitotoxicity and oxidative stress. Thus, the latter could be a contributing factor in the onset and slow progression of ALS/PDC in Guam.
23232059	Cynaropicrin from Cynara scolymus L. suppresses photoaging of skin by inhibiting the transcription activity of nuclear factor-kappa B.	Aging of skin is characterized by skin wrinkling, laxity, and pigmentation induced by several environmental stress factors. Histological changes during the photoaging of skin include hyperproliferation of keratinocytes and melanocytes causing skin wrinkles and pigmentation. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) is one of the representative transcription factors active in conjunction with inflammation. NF-κB is activated by stimulation such as ultraviolet rays and inflammatory cytokines and induces the expression of various genes such as those of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and matrix metalloprotease-1 (MMP-1). We screened several plant extracts for their possible inhibitory effect on the transcriptional activity of NF-κB. One of them, an extract from Cynara scolymus L., showed a greatest effect on the suppression of NF-κB transactivation. As a result, we found that cynaropicrin, which is a sesquiterpene lactone, inhibited the NF-κB-mediated transactivation of bFGF and MMP-1. Furthermore, it was confirmed that in an in vivo mouse model cynaropicrin prevented skin photoaging processes leading to the hyperproliferation of keratinocytes and melanocytes. These findings taken together indicate that cynaropicrin is an effective antiphotoaging agent that acts by inhibiting NF-κB-mediated transactivation.
2886573	Differential haemodynamic effects induced by beta 1-(bisoprolol) or beta 2-(ICI 118,551) adrenoceptor blockade in man.	To characterize beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor mediated effects in man the influence of the selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist bisoprolol and the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551 on changes in blood pressure, heart rate and lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor density evoked by dynamic exercise or isoprenaline infusion was studied in 12 male normotensive volunteers. Bisoprolol administration (1 X 10 mg/day) did not affect lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor density, while ICI 118,551 (3 X 25 mg/day) increased it by about 40%. Exercise as well as isoprenaline infusion caused 100% increases in lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor density; these increases were completely abolished by ICI 118,551, but not affected by bisoprolol. ICI 118,551 markedly attenuated isoprenaline-induced decrease in diastolic blood pressure, but did not affect increase in systolic blood pressure; on the contrary, bisoprolol inhibited the isoprenaline-evoked increase in systolic blood pressure, but did not affect the decrease in diastolic blood pressure. ICI 118,551 antagonized the isoprenaline-induced tachycardia much more potently than bisoprolol, while bisoprolol, but not ICI 118,551, suppressed exercise-induced tachycardia. It is concluded that exercise-induced tachycardia is mediated by cardiac beta 1-adrenoceptor stimulation, whereas isoprenaline-induced tachycardia is mediated by both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation.
23214423	Anisotropy of chemical bonding in semifluorinated graphite C2F revealed with angle-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy.	Highly oriented pyrolytic graphite characterized by a low misorientation of crystallites is fluorinated using a gaseous mixture of BrF(3) with Br(2) at room temperature. The golden-colored product, easily delaminating into micrometer-size transparent flakes, is an intercalation compound where Br(2) molecules are hosted between fluorinated graphene layers of approximate C(2)F composition. To unravel the chemical bonding in semifluorinated graphite, we apply angle-resolved near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy and quantum-chemical modeling. The strong angular dependence of the CK and FK edge NEXAFS spectra on the incident radiation indicates that room-temperature-produced graphite fluoride is a highly anisotropic material, where half of the carbon atoms are covalently bonded with fluorine, while the rest of the carbon atoms preserve π electrons. Comparison of the experimental CK edge spectrum with theoretical spectra plotted for C(2)F models reveals that fluorine atoms are more likely to form chains. This conclusion agrees with the atomic force microscopy observation of a chain-like pattern on the surface of graphite fluoride layers.
11006272	A novel hepatointestinal leukotriene B4 receptor. Cloning and functional characterization.	Leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)) is a product of eicosanoid metabolism and acts as an extremely potent chemotactic mediator for inflammation. LTB(4) exerts positive effects on the immigration and activation of leukocytes. These effects suggest an involvement of LTB(4) in several diseases: inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, arthritis, and asthma. LTB(4) elicits actions through interaction with one or more cell surface receptors that lead to chemotaxis and inflammation. One leukotriene B(4) receptor has been recently identified (LTB(4)-R1). In this report we describe cloning of a cDNA encoding a novel 358-amino acid receptor (LTB(4)-R2) that possesses seven membrane-spanning domains and is homologous (42%) and genetically linked to LTB(4)-R1. Expression of LTB(4)-R2 is broad but highest in liver, intestine, spleen, and kidney. In radioligand binding assays, membranes prepared from COS-7 cells transfected with LTB(4)-R2 cDNA displayed high affinity (K(d) = 0.17 nm) for [(3)H]LTB(4). Radioligand competition assays revealed high affinities of the receptor for LTB(4) and LTB(5), and 20-hydroxy-LTB(4), and intermediate affinities for 15(S)-HETE and 12-oxo-ETE. Three LTB(4) receptor antagonists, 14,15-dehydro-LTB(4), LTB(4)-3-aminopropylamide, and U-75302, had high affinity for LTB(4)-R1 but not for LTB(4)-R2. No apparent affinity binding for the receptors was detected for the CysLT1-selective antagonists montelukast and zafirlukast. LTB(4) functionally mobilized intracellular calcium and inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP production in 293 cells. The discovery of this new receptor should aid in further understanding the roles of LTB(4) in pathologies in these tissues and may provide a tool in identification of specific antagonists/agonists for potential therapeutic treatments.
16843091	Vasopressin antagonists as aquaretic agents for the treatment of hyponatremia.	Hyponatremia is the most frequent electrolyte disorder encountered in hospitalized patients. It is a state of relative water excess due to stimulated arginine vasopressin (AVP) and fluid intake greater than obligatory losses. This kind of hyponatremia occurs in the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, congestive heart failure, and liver cirrhosis. Fluid restriction is the presently recommended treatment for hyponatremia. However, fluid restriction may be very difficult for patients to achieve, is slow to work, and does not allow a graded therapeutic approach. More efficient and specific treatments of hyponatremia are needed. In this respect, pharmacologic research has yielded a number of compounds exhibiting antagonistic qualities at the vasopressin V2 receptor. Among these agents, peptidic derivatives of AVP turned out to have intrinsic antidiuretic properties in vivo when given over days or weeks. The development of such agents for use in patients has not been pursued. However, several promising nonpeptide, vasopressin receptor antagonists have been described; these agents are VPA-985 (lixivaptan), YM-087 (conivaptan), OPC-41061 (tolvaptan), and SR-121463. Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trials performed with these agents found that they corrected hyponatremia efficiently and safely. Most of the studies were conducted over a 4- to 28-day period. Long-term studies will be needed in the future to address such issues as the eventual benefit to patients and the effects of vasopressin antagonists on morbidity and mortality of patients with hyponatremia.
20519365	Labour is associated with decreased expression of the PGF2alpha receptor (PTGFR) and a novel PTGFR splice variant in human myometrium but not decidua.	The prostaglandin F(2alpha) receptor (PTGFR) is believed to play a role in the process of parturition. The main support for this comes from animal studies; however, in humans, the evidence is less clear. The gene coding for PTGFR may be subject to alternative splicing to generate alternate variants with different signalling pathways. We have determined regional (upper versus lower segment) and labour-associated expression of PTGFR mRNA and a recently identified splice variant of PTGFR in human myometrium and decidua. We also examined the effect of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) on PTGFR mRNA expression in a model of cultured human myometrial smooth muscle cells. We identified a PTGFR transcript variant 2 (PTGFR-v2) generated by alternate splicing in human myometrium and decidua. The PTGFR-v2 contains an additional 71 base pair exon, which results in a truncated protein at 297 amino acids compared with the PTGFR transcript variant 1 (PTGFR-v1) at 359 amino acids. In contrast to our hypothesis, we demonstrate that PTGFR-v1 and PTGFR-v2 mRNA expression is not significantly higher in upper segment compared with lower segment paired samples. We also show a labour-associated decrease in PTGFR-v1 and PTGFR-v2 mRNA expression in lower segment myometrial samples. IL-1beta-stimulated mRNA expression of both PTGFR variants in a distinct time-dependent manner in myometrial cell cultures. We suggest that the role of the PTGFR in the human uterus requires further validation prior to pursuing it as a target for the treatment of preterm labour. In addition, the presence of distinct variants suggests further levels of gene regulation within the pregnant uterus.
10373224	Mechanistic differences of various AT1-receptor blockers in isolated vessels of different origin.	The functional inhibitory characteristics of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) candesartan; irbesartan; and losartan and its active metabolite EXP 3174 (EXP) were studied in rabbit aortic strips and rat portal vein preparations in vitro. Moreover, plasma-protein binding was determined, and the binding was high (>98. 5%) for all ARBs. These values were needed to relate the concentrations of the ARBs used in vitro to the nonprotein bound concentrations in clinical use. In both vascular preparations, candesartan caused a marked decrease in the maximal contractile response of the angiotensin II (Ang II) concentration-response curve. Losartan, EXP, and irbesartan caused a rightward parallel shift without any major effects on the maximal response to Ang II. The inhibitory effect of candesartan developed slowly (maximal effect after >30 minutes) and lasted >2 hours despite repeated washing of the vessels. The effect of losartan, irbesartan, and EXP had a faster onset, and most of the inhibitory effect disappeared after washing. The duration of the inhibitory effects of the ARBs were not related to lipophilicity of the compounds. Cooling of the rat portal vein preparations to 4 degrees C before administration of candesartan prevented the persistent inhibition of Ang II response seen at 37 degrees C. For the other ARBs studied, the magnitude of inhibition and the speed of recovery of the Ang II response were independent of the incubation temperature before washing. In addition, when candesartan was given to conscious rats, the inhibitory effect on Ang II-induced blood pressure responses persisted during the 24-hour period despite nondetectable plasma concentrations of candesartan at 24 hours. It is concluded that functional inhibitory characteristics of candesartan differ from those of the other ARBs tested. At clinically relevant concentrations, candesartan is an insurmountable and long-lasting antagonist of the vascular contractile responses to Ang II.
20007701	Directed evolution reveals hidden properties of VMAT, a neurotransmitter transporter.	The vesicular neurotransmitter transporter VMAT2 is responsible for the transport of monoamines into synaptic and storage vesicles. VMAT2 is the target of many psychoactive drugs and is essential for proper neurotransmission and survival. Here we describe a new expression system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that takes advantage of the polyspecificity of VMAT2. Expression of rVMAT2 confers resistance to acriflavine and to the parkinsonian toxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)) by their removal into the yeast vacuole. This expression system allowed identification of a new substrate, acriflavine, and isolation of mutants with modified affinity to tetrabenazine (TBZ), a non-competitive inhibitor of VMAT2 that is used in the treatment of various movement disorders including Tourette syndrome and Huntington chorea. Whereas one type of mutant obtained displayed decreased affinity to TBZ, a second type showed only a slight decrease in the affinity to TBZ, displayed a higher K(m) to the neurotransmitter serotonin, but conferred increased resistance to acriflavine and MPP(+). A protein where both types of mutations were combined (with only three amino acid replacements) lost most of the properties of the neurotransmitter transporter (TBZ-insensitive, no transport of neurotransmitter) but displayed enhanced resistance to the above toxicants. The work described here shows that in the case of rVMAT2, loss of traits acquired in evolution of function (such as serotonin transport and TBZ binding) bring about an improvement in older functions such as resistance to toxic compounds. A process that has taken millions of years of evolution can be reversed by three mutations.
23561205	Curcumin inhibits invasion and metastasis in K1 papillary thyroid cancer cells.	Curcumin, the active constituent of dietary spice turmeric, possesses a strong potential for cancer prevention and treatment. However, there is no study to address the effects of curcumin on invasion and metastasis of thyroid cancers. Thyroid cancer is the most common malignancy of endocrine organs, and its incidence rates have steadily increased over recent decades. Although most indolent tumours can be effectively managed, metastatic tumours at distant secondary sites behave aggressively and currently there is no effective form of treatment. Here, for the first time it has been reported that curcumin inhibit multiple metastasis steps of K1 papillary thyroid cancer cells. Curcumin dose-dependently suppressed viability of K1 cells as well as its cell attachment, spreading, migration and invasion abilities. Moreover, curcumin could also down-regulate the expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). The findings showed that curcumin might be an effective tumouristatic agent for the treatment of aggressive papillary thyroid carcinomas.
23645249	Repression of mammary adipogenesis by genistein limits mammosphere formationof human MCF-7 cells.	Mammary adipose tissue may contribute to breast cancer development and progression by altering neighboring epithelial cell behavior and phenotype through paracrine signaling. Dietary exposure to soy foods is associated with lower mammary tumor risk and reduced body weight and adiposity in humans and in rodent breast cancer models. Despite the suggested linkage between obesity and breast cancer, the local influence of bioactive dietary components on mammary adiposity for anti-tumor effects remains unknown. Herein, we report that post-weaning dietary exposure to soy protein isolate and its bioactive isoflavone genistein lowered mammary adiposity and increased mammary tumor suppressor PTEN and E-cadherin expression in female mice, relative to control casein diet. To ascertain genistein's role in mammary adipose deposition that may affect underlying epithelial cell phenotype, we evaluated genistein's effects on SV40-immortalized mouse mammary stromal fibroblast-like (MSF) cells during differentiation to adipocytes. MSF cultured in differentiation medium with 40 nM genistein showed reductions in mature adipocyte numbers, triglyceride accumulation, and PPARγ and fatty acid synthase transcript levels. Genistein inhibition of adipose differentiation was accompanied by increased estrogen receptor (ER)-β gene expression and was modestly recapitulated by ERβ selective agonist 2,3-bis (4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionitrile (DPN). Reduction of ERβ expression by siRNA targeting increased PPARγ transcript levels and stromal fibroblast differentiation into mature adipocytes; the latter was reversed by genistein but not DPN. Conditioned medium from genistein-treated adipocytes diminished anchorage-independent mammosphere formation of human MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Our results suggest a mechanistic pathway to support direct regulation by genistein of mammary adiposity for breast cancer prevention.
15748157	Neuroprotective effects of atorvastatin against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in primary cortical neurones.	Statins [3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors] exert cholesterol-independent pleiotropic effects that include anti-thrombotic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidative properties. Here, we examined direct protective effects of atorvastatin on neurones in different cell damage models in vitro. Primary cortical neurones were pre-treated with atorvastatin and then exposed to (i) glutamate, (ii) oxygen-glucose deprivation or (iii) several apoptosis-inducing compounds. Atorvastatin significantly protected from glutamate-induced excitotoxicity as evidenced by propidium iodide staining, nuclear morphology, release of lactate dehydrogenase, and mitochondrial tetrazolium metabolism, but not from oxygen-glucose deprivation or apoptotic cell death. This anti-excitototoxic effect was evident with 2-4 days pre-treatment but not with daily administration or shorter-term pre-treatment. The protective properties occurred independently of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibition because co-treatment with mevalonate or other isoprenoids did not reverse or attenuate neuroprotection. Atorvastatin attenuated the glutamate-induced increase of intracellular calcium, which was associated with a modulation of NMDA receptor function. Taken together, atorvastatin exerts specific anti-excitotoxic effects independent of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibition, which has potential therapeutic implications.
17139155	[Use of biosensors for detecting organophosphorus agents].	The present paper reviews the use of electrochemical biosensors for detecting organophosphorus pesticides and nerve agents. Acetylcholine esterase (AChE)-immobilized electrodes have been used for detecting AChE inhibitors including organophosphorus and carbamate pesticides. The sensors are composed of AChE and choline oxidase (ChOx) for converting the AChE-generated choline into betaine and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), which is electrochemically oxidized at the electrode surface to produce the output signal of the sensor. In the presence of AChE inhibitors, the suppressed output signal of the sensor can be observed. If the sensors are operated in the presence of acetylthiocholine as a substrate of AChE, one can eliminate ChOx from the sensor design because enzymatically generated thiocholine is electrochemically active and thus directly oxidized at the electrode without using ChOx. Electron-transfer mediators such as tetracyanoquinodimethane have often been used for catalytically oxidizing thiocholine at the electrode set at less positive potential, which is effective in circumventing possible interference arising from oxidizing compounds in the sample solution. One of the drawbacks of the AChE-based biosensors in detecting organophosphorus pesticides and nerve agents arises from the fact that the sensors indirectly detect the signal based on the inhibition of the AChE-catalyzed reaction. On the other hand, for directly obtaining the output signal, organophosphorus hydrolase (OPH) is immobilized on the electrode surface to prepare amperometric biosensors. OPH catalyzes the hydrolysis reaction of organophosphorus compounds to produce electrochemically active compounds such as p-nitrophenol and thiols from parathion and VX, respectively. Thus OPH-based sensors can be used for detecting these compounds directly. These biosensors would be useful for in-site measurements of organophosphorus pesticides and nerve agents because portable-type biosensors are easily fabricated at relatively low cost.
23339663	Inhibition pathways of the potent organophosphate CBDP with cholinesterases revealed by X-ray crystallographic snapshots and mass spectrometry.	Tri-o-cresyl-phosphate (TOCP) is a common additive in jet engine lubricants and hydraulic fluids suspected to have a role in aerotoxic syndrome in humans. TOCP is metabolized to cresyl saligenin phosphate (CBDP), a potent irreversible inhibitor of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), a natural bioscavenger present in the bloodstream, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the off-switch at cholinergic synapses. Mechanistic details of cholinesterase (ChE) inhibition have, however, remained elusive. Also, the inhibition of AChE by CBDP is unexpected, from a structural standpoint, i.e., considering the narrowness of AChE active site and the bulkiness of CBDP. In the following, we report on kinetic X-ray crystallography experiments that provided 2.7-3.3 Å snapshots of the reaction of CBDP with mouse AChE and human BChE. The series of crystallographic snapshots reveals that AChE and BChE react with the opposite enantiomers and that an induced-fit rearrangement of Phe297 enlarges the active site of AChE upon CBDP binding. Mass spectrometry analysis of aging in either H(2)(16)O or H(2)(18)O furthermore allowed us to identify the inhibition steps, in which water molecules are involved, thus providing insights into the mechanistic details of inhibition. X-ray crystallography and mass spectrometry show the formation of an aged end product formed in both AChE and BChE that cannot be reactivated by current oxime-based therapeutics. Our study thus shows that only prophylactic and symptomatic treatments are viable to counter the inhibition of AChE and BChE by CBDP.
17553661	Transfection of HepG2 cells with hGSTA4 provides protection against 4-hydroxynonenal-mediated oxidative injury.	4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) is a mutagenic alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde produced during oxidative injury that is conjugated by several glutathione S-transferase (GST) isoforms. The alpha class human GSTA4-4 enzyme (hGSTA4-4) has a particularly high catalytic efficiency toward 4-HNE conjugation. However, hGST4-4 expression is low in most human cells and there are other aldehyde metabolizing enzymes that detoxify 4-HNE. In the current study, we determined the effect of over-expression of hGSTA4 mRNA on the sensitivity of HepG2 cells to 4-HNE injury. HepG2 cells transfected with an hGSTA4 vector construct exhibited high steady-state hGSTA4 mRNA, high GST-4-HNE catalytic activities, but lower basal glutathione (GSH) concentrations relative to insert-free vector (control) cells. Exposure to 4-HNE elicited an increase in GSH concentrations in the control and hGSTA4 cells, although the dose-response of GSH induction differed among the two cell types. Specifically, hGSTA4 cells had significantly higher GSH concentrations when exposed to 5-15 microM 4-HNE, but not at 20 microM 4-HNE, suggesting extensive GSH utilization at high concentrations of 4-HNE. The hGSTA4 cells exhibited a significant growth advantage relative to control cells in the absence of 4-HNE, and a trend towards increased growth at low dose exposures to 4-HNE. However, the hGSTA4 cells did not exhibit a growth advantage relative to control cells at higher 4-HNE exposures associated with increased GSH utilization. As expected, the hGSTA4 cells showed resistance to 4-HNE stimulated lipid peroxidation at all 4-HNE doses. In summary, our data indicates that over-expression of hGSTA4 at levels conferring high GST-4-HNE conjugating activity confers a partial growth advantage to HepG2 cells and protects against 4-HNE oxidative injury. However, the loss of proliferative capacity of hGSTA4 cells challenged with levels of 4-HNE associated with severe oxidative stress indicates a role of other aldehyde metabolizing enzymes, and/or GSH-electrophile transporter proteins, in providing full cellular protection against 4-HNE toxicity.
23470776	Environmental stress, oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) polymorphism, and mental health following collective stress.	We examined whether the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs53576 genotype buffers the combined impact of negative social environments (e.g., interpersonal conflict/constraint) and economic stress on post-traumatic stress (PTS) symptoms and impaired daily functioning following collective stress (September 11th terrorist attacks). Saliva was collected by mail and used to genotype 704 respondents. Participants completed Web-based assessments of pre-9/11 mental health, acute stress 9-23days after 9/11, the quality of social environments 1year post-9/11, economic stress 18months post-9/11, and PTS symptoms and impaired functioning 2 and 3years post-9/11. Interactions between negative social environments and economic stress were examined separately based on OXTR rs53576 genotype (GG vs. any A allele). For individuals with an A allele, a negative social environment significantly increased PTS symptoms without regard to the level of economic stress experienced. However, for respondents with a GG genotype, negative social environments predicted elevated PTS symptoms only for those also experiencing high economic stress. Gender moderated associations between negative social environments, economic stress, and impaired functioning. The functioning of females was most affected by negative social environments regardless of genotype and economic stress, whereas the functioning of males was differentially susceptible to economic stress depending on OXTR genotype and negative social environments. These findings suggest that it is important to consider the combined impact of gender and ongoing stress in different domains as moderators of genetic vulnerability following collective stress.
23630454	PICK1 Deficiency Impairs Secretory Vesicle Biogenesis and Leads to Growth Retardation and Decreased Glucose Tolerance.	Secretory vesicles in endocrine cells store hormones such as growth hormone (GH) and insulin before their release into the bloodstream. The molecular mechanisms governing budding of immature secretory vesicles from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and their subsequent maturation remain unclear. Here, we identify the lipid binding BAR (Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs) domain protein PICK1 (protein interacting with C kinase 1) as a key component early in the biogenesis of secretory vesicles in GH-producing cells. Both PICK1-deficient Drosophila and mice displayed somatic growth retardation. Growth retardation was rescued in flies by reintroducing PICK1 in neurosecretory cells producing somatotropic peptides. PICK1-deficient mice were characterized by decreased body weight and length, increased fat accumulation, impaired GH secretion, and decreased storage of GH in the pituitary. Decreased GH storage was supported by electron microscopy showing prominent reduction in secretory vesicle number. Evidence was also obtained for impaired insulin secretion associated with decreased glucose tolerance. PICK1 localized in cells to immature secretory vesicles, and the PICK1 BAR domain was shown by live imaging to associate with vesicles budding from the TGN and to possess membrane-sculpting properties in vitro. In mouse pituitary, PICK1 co-localized with the BAR domain protein ICA69, and PICK1 deficiency abolished ICA69 protein expression. In the Drosophila brain, PICK1 and ICA69 co-immunoprecipitated and showed mutually dependent expression. Finally, both in a Drosophila model of type 2 diabetes and in high-fat-diet-induced obese mice, we observed up-regulation of PICK1 mRNA expression. Our findings suggest that PICK1, together with ICA69, is critical during budding of immature secretory vesicles from the TGN and thus for vesicular storage of GH and possibly other hormones. The data link two BAR domain proteins to membrane remodeling processes in the secretory pathway of peptidergic endocrine cells and support an important role of PICK1/ICA69 in maintenance of metabolic homeostasis.
23293962	Hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor type 2 (HAI-2) modulates hepcidin expression by inhibiting the cell surface protease matriptase-2.	Matriptase-2, a recently identified cell surface protease, is the key enzyme of iron homoeostasis modulating the expression of the liver peptide hormone hepcidin. HAI (hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor) types 1 and 2 (HAI-1 and HAI-2 respectively) have been shown to inhibit the close homologue, i.e. matriptase. By co-expressing matriptase-2 and the inhibitor HAI-2 we have identified HAI-2 displaying high inhibitory potential against matriptase-2 at the cell surface as well as in conditioned medium. Accordingly, complex formation between matriptase-2 and HAI-2 was demonstrated by isolation of the complex via immobilizing either HAI-2 or matriptase-2 from lysates and conditioned medium of co-expressing cells. Furthermore, HAI-2 indirectly influences the expression of the hepcidin-encoding gene HAMP. The inhibitor abrogates the matriptase-2-mediated suppression of HAMP expression, presumably by inhibiting the supposed potential of matriptase-2 to cleave membrane-bound HJV (haemojuvelin). Taken together, the results of the present study have characterized HAI-2 as an inhibitor of matriptase-2 that modulates the synthesis of hepcidin and provides new insights into the regulatory mechanism of iron homoeostasis, with clinical importance for a treatment of iron overload diseases.
7610922	Intracellular calcium increases mediated by a recombinant human calcitonin receptor.	Stable transfectants expressing a recombinant human calcitonin receptor respond to calcitonin via increased cyclic adenosine 3',5' monophosphate (cAMP, EC50 = 0.06 nM salmon calcitonin [sCT]) and a transient mobilization of intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) coincident with turnover of inositol phosphate (IP; EC50 = 6 nM sCT). Millimolar increases in extracellular calcium ([Ca2+]o, EC50 = 8 mM) cause a rapid elevation in [Ca2+]i after a calcitonin dose-dependent pretreatment of cells (pretreatment EC50 = 0.2 nM sCT). Cells exhibit persistent sensitivity to increased [Ca2+]o up to 3 h after hormone exposure and even after multiple cycles of increased [Ca2+]o followed by wash. Calcitonin pretreatment of cells also allows apparent influx of elevated extracellular strontium and manganese, but little or no effect is observed on addition of barium, cadmium, or lanthanum. Human amylin (100 nM) causes a rapid and transient increase in [Ca2+]i comparable to that of calcitonin; however, no significant response to increased [Ca2+]o is observed after amylin addition. Human calcitonin gene-related product (hCGRP) (300 nM) and forskolin do not increase [Ca2+]i or activate a sensitivity to increased [Ca2+]o. Nevertheless, human amylin and human calcitonin gene-related product (hCGRP) activate adenylate cyclase with EC50s of 0.7 nM and 8 nM, respectively. The calcium-channel drugs verapamil, BAY K 8644, diltiazem, and nifedipine have little effect on [Ca2+]i increases. The calcitonin-induced transient mobilization of calcium is inhibited by treatment of cells with cholera toxin or 8-(diethylamino)-octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate (TMB-8); whereas, the response to subsequent increased [Ca2+]o is inhibited by lanthanum chloride (200 microM) and lower pH (6.0).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
23479408	Dyslipidemia in type 2 diabetes: prevalence, pathophysiology, and management.	Dyslipidemia is one of the key risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in diabetes mellitus. Despite the mounting clinical trial data, the management of dyslipidemia other than lowering the low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) continues to be controversial. The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are high plasma triglyceride concentration, reduced high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) concentration, and increased concentration of small dense LDL particles. These changes are caused by increased free fatty acid flux secondary to insulin resistance and aggravated by increased inflammatory adipokines. The availability of several lipid-lowering drugs and nutritional supplements offers novel and effective options for achieving target lipid levels in people with diabetes. While initiation of drug therapy based on differences in the lipid profile is an option, most practice guidelines recommend statins as first-line therapy. Although the evidence for clinical utility of combination of statins with fibrates or nicotinic acid in reducing cardiovascular events remains inconclusive, the preponderance of evidence suggests that a subgroup who have high triglycerides and low HDL-c levels may benefit from combination therapy of statins and fibrates. The goal of therapy is to achieve at least 30-40 % reduction in LDL-c levels. Preferably the LDL-c should be less than 100 mg/dL in low-risk people and less than 70 mg/dL in those at high risk, including people with established CVD.
17397529	Inborn errors in the metabolism of glutathione.	Glutathione is a tripeptide composed of glutamate, cysteine and glycine. Glutathione is present in millimolar concentrations in most mammalian cells and it is involved in several fundamental biological functions, including free radical scavenging, detoxification of xenobiotics and carcinogens, redox reactions, biosynthesis of DNA, proteins and leukotrienes, as well as neurotransmission/neuromodulation. Glutathione is metabolised via the gamma-glutamyl cycle, which is catalyzed by six enzymes. In man, hereditary deficiencies have been found in five of the six enzymes. Glutathione synthetase deficiency is the most frequently recognized disorder and, in its severe form, it is associated with hemolytic anemia, metabolic acidosis, 5-oxoprolinuria, central nervous system (CNS) damage and recurrent bacterial infections. Gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase deficiency is also associated with hemolytic anemia, and some patients with this disorder show defects of neuromuscular function and generalized aminoaciduria. Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase deficiency has been found in patients with CNS involvement and glutathionuria. 5-Oxoprolinase deficiency is associated with 5-oxoprolinuria but without a clear association with other symptoms. Dipeptidase deficiency has been described in one patient. All disorders are very rare and inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Most of the mutations are leaky so that many patients have residual enzyme activity. Diagnosis is made by measuring the concentration of different metabolites in the gamma-glutamyl cycle, enzyme activity and in glutathione synthetase and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase deficiency, also by mutation analysis. Prenatal diagnosis has been preformed in glutathione synthetase deficiency. The prognosis is difficult to predict, as few patients are known, but seems to vary significantly between different patients. The aims of the treatment of glutathione synthesis defects are to avoid hemolytic crises and to increase the defense against reactive oxygen species. No treatment has been recommended for gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, 5-oxoprolinase and dipeptidase deficiency.
22991330	Can peripheral blood γδ T cells predict osteonecrosis of the jaw? An immunological perspective on the adverse drug effects of aminobisphosphonate therapy.	Nitrogen-bisphosphonates (n-BP), often referred to as aminobisphosphonates, are the most commonly prescribed drugs for the treatment of disorders of bone fragility. However, long-term continuous treatment predisposes certain individuals to serious rare side effects, such as bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw (BAONJ). n-BP use is known to unintentionally activate a subset of innate T cells called Vγ9Vδ2 T cells, but the consequence of this chronic immune stimulation has remained unexplored. The primary objectives of this study were to 1) determine the fate of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells in osteoporotic patients on n-BP therapy as a function of time and type of therapy; 2) evaluate the proportion of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells in patients who had recently experienced n-BP-associated ONJ. We found there is a notable loss of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells over time in osteoporotic patients on n-BP therapy, particularly those on intravenous (iv) therapy (Spearman r = -0.55, p < 0.0001 iv; r = -0.3, p < 0.03 oral) (n = 68); no difference was observed in total T cells, monocytes, or granulocytes. Importantly, the observed negative effect on Vγ9Vδ2 T cells coincides with the reported route of administration and timing of the rare occurrence of BAONJ. Patients (n = 6) who had experienced BAONJ were all found to be significantly deficient in Vγ9Vδ2 T cells (median = 0.07%) in comparison to age- and sex-matched treatment-naïve controls (N = 11; median = 2.40%), U = 0, p = 0.001; this was the only consistent difference in the leukocytes assessed. All BAONJ cases had an underlying condition that further contributed to impaired immunity. We propose Vγ9Vδ2 T cells show a strong potential to serve as harbingers of possible adverse immune effects of n-BP therapy, particularly in those patients already having a compromised immune system as they may be most vulnerable to the development of conditions such as BAONJ.
19300583	Transdermal selegiline for the treatment of major depressive disorder.	"Non-selective inhibition of monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzymes (ie, isoforms A and B) in the brain are associated with clinically significant antidepressant effects. In the US, the selegiline transdermal system (STS; EMSAM) is the first antidepressant transdermal delivery system to receive Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved labeling for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Currently, the use of orally administered MAO inhibitor antidepressants (eg, phenelzine, tranylcypromine) is limited by the risk of tyramine-provoked events (eg, acute hypertension and headache, also known as the ""cheese reaction"") when combined with dietary tyramine. The selegiline transdermal system is the only MAOI available in the US for the treatment of MDD that does not require dietary restriction at the clinically effective dose of 6 mg/24 hours. Delivery of selegiline transdermally (EMSAM((R))) bypasses hepatic first pass metabolism, thereby avoiding significant inhibition of gastrointestinal and hepatic MAO-A activity (ie, reduced risk of tyramine-provoked events) while still providing sufficient levels of selegiline in the brain to produce an antidepressant effect. At dosages of 6-12 mg/24 hours, EMSAM has been shown to improve symptoms of depression, have good tolerability, and have high rates of medication adherence. However, at higher doses of EMSAM (ie, 9 mg/24 hours or more), dietary restriction of tyramine intake is recommended. The introduction of EMSAM overcomes many of the safety concerns affiliated with the conventional oral MAO inhibitors and EMSAM may be considered another strategy for the treatment of MDD, especially in patients who cannot tolerate oral antidepressants, are poorly adherent, who present with atypical depressive symptoms, or have failed other antidepressants."
16497876	New assignments for multitasking signal transduction inhibitors.	An article presented in this issue of Molecular Pharmacology (p. 1527) provides an intriguing example of how tyrosine kinase inhibitors can be put to many uses. In this article, the action of dasatinib (BMS-354825) is contrasted with that of imatinib, a kinase inhibitor that is currently being used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia and other disorders. Both pharmacologic inhibitors target several tyrosine kinases, including Bcr-Abl and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR). Up to this point, the PDGFR has not been a primary therapeutic target for this class of agents. The work of Chen and colleagues shows that dasatinib is a particularly potent inhibitor of PDGFR and that the compound also targets Src kinase. The authors suggest that this combination of activities could be useful in the treatment of vascular obstructive diseases. Although a lack of absolute specificity has typically been regarded as a pharmacologic drawback, this study exemplifies how drugs with multiple molecular targets can potentially provide a very beneficial spectrum of therapeutic activities in multiple disease states.
23644200	Glycosylation enhances the anti-migratory activities of isomalyngamide A analogs.	"Three, new, fully synthetic glycosylated isomalyngamide A analogs 4-6 were prepared and evaluated for their anti-migratory activities in human breast cancer cells. The results of the study show that two glycosylated derivatives 4 and 5, containing mannose and galactose appendages, suppress metastatic events (e.g., migration, invasion and adhesion) in human breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells at ""nontoxic"" concentration levels. In contrast, derivative 6 that contains a lactose moiety, displays a less potent activity. The findings show that monosaccharide rather than disaccharide appendages to the isomalyngamide A backbone more greatly influence cell migration and invasive ability. Evidence has been gained for a mechanism for inhibition of metastatic activities in MDA-MB-231 cells by 4 and 5, involving inactivation of the expression of p-FAK and paxillin through the integrin-mediated antimetastatic pathway."
17284757	alpha-Linolenic acid, Delta6-desaturase gene polymorphism, and the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction.	BACKGROUND: Delta(6)-Desaturase (FADS2) is the rate-limiting step in the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) biosynthetic pathway. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to test whether the common deletion [T/-] in the promoter of FADS2 affects the PUFA biosynthetic pathway and consequently modifies the effect of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) on myocardial infarction (MI). DESIGN: Case subjects (n =1694) with a first nonfatal acute MI were matched by age, sex, and area of residence to 1694 population-based control subjects in Costa Rica. PUFAs were quantified by gas-liquid chromatography from plasma and adipose tissue samples. Least-squares means from generalized linear models and odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs from multiple conditional logistic regression models were estimated. RESULTS: The prevalence of the variant T/- allele was 48%. Eicosapentaenoic acid, gamma-linolenic acid, and arachidonic acid decreased in adipose tissue and plasma with increasing number of copies of the variant allele with a monotonic trend (P < 0.05 for all). Fasting plasma triacylglycerols by genotype were 2.08 mmol/L for TT, 2.16 mmol/L for T-, and 2.26 mmol/L for - - [ie, homozygous for the variant (deletion) allele] (P = 0.03). The FADS2 deletion was not associated with MI and did not significantly modify the association between adipose tissue ALA and the risk of MI. CONCLUSIONS: The FADS2 deletion may prevent the conversion of ALA into very-long-chain PUFAs. However, this metabolic effect is not translated into an attenuated risk between ALA and MI among carriers of the variant. It is possible that, at current intakes of ALA, any potential defect in the transcription of the gene is masked by the availability of substrate. Further research in populations deficient in ALA intake is warranted.
2386945	Inhibition of human breast cancer cell proliferation in tissue culture by the neuroleptic agents pimozide and thioridazine.	Permanent cell culture lines derived from human breast cancer tissue are important experimental models in the study of human breast cancer cell proliferation. In the present work, pimozide, thioridazine, W-13, and W-12 were shown to inhibit MCF-7 human breast cancer cell growth. The 50% inhibition concentration values determined in two proliferation assays, [3H]thymidine incorporation and cell number, were in close agreement for each compound tested. The order of potency for growth inhibition in the presence of 2% stripped calf serum was pimozide (Ki 2 microM) greater than thioridazine (Ki 5 microM) greater than W-13 (Ki 15 microM) greater than W-12 (Ki 39 microM). Similar concentrations of these compounds blocked estradiol-induced growth of MCF-7 cells, but estrogen receptor (ER) interactions do not seem to be involved. Pimozide and thioridazine had no effect on the estradiol binding properties of the MCF-7 ER, nor did pimozide interfere with the induction of progesterone receptors by estradiol. Furthermore, pimozide also inhibited incorporation of [3H]thymidine into MCF-7 cells stimulated by polypeptide hormones in serum-free medium. The Ki for pimozide in serum-free medium alone, 0.46 microM, was similar to that determined in the presence of insulin (0.42 microM), insulin-like growth factor I (0.54 microM), and epidermal growth factor (0.43 microM). The effects of pimozide on breast cancer cell growth were not limited to the MCF-7 cell line. Pimozide also blocked cell growth and [3H]thymidine incorporation into the ER-positive T47D and ZR75-1B human breast cancer cell lines and the ER-negative human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231. Although numerous mechanisms of action of pimozide and thioridazine have been identified, both drugs are calmodulin antagonists at drug concentrations that inhibit breast cancer cell growth in vitro. Inhibition of MCF-7 cell growth by the selective calmodulin antagonists W-13 and W-12 is consistent with a role for calmodulin antagonism in the broad growth-inhibitory properties of pimozide. We conclude that pimozide and thioridazine may be useful in the control of estradiol- and polypeptide hormone-induced growth of ER-positive and ER-negative human breast tumors.
12660248	L-methionine availability regulates expression of the methionine adenosyltransferase 2A gene in human hepatocarcinoma cells: role of S-adenosylmethionine.	In mammals, methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT), the enzyme responsible for S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) synthesis, is encoded by two genes, MAT1A and MAT2A. In liver, MAT1A expression is associated with high AdoMet levels and a differentiated phenotype, whereas MAT2A expression is associated with lower AdoMet levels and a dedifferentiated phenotype. In the current study, we examined regulation of MAT2A gene expression by l-methionine availability using HepG2 cells. In l-methionine-deficient cells, MAT2A gene expression is rapidly induced, and methionine adenosyltransferase activity is increased. Restoration of l-methionine rapidly down-regulates MAT2A mRNA levels; for this effect, l-methionine needs to be converted into AdoMet. This novel action of AdoMet is not mediated through a methyl transfer reaction. MAT2A gene expression was also regulated by 5'-methylthioadenosine, but this was dependent on 5'-methylthioadenosine conversion to methionine through the salvage pathway. The transcription rate of the MAT2A gene remained unchanged during l-methionine starvation; however, its mRNA half-life was significantly increased (from 100 min to more than 3 h). The effect of l-methionine withdrawal on MAT2A mRNA stabilization requires both gene transcription and protein synthesis. We conclude that MAT2A gene expression is modulated as an adaptive response of the cell to l-methionine availability through its conversion to AdoMet.
23428385	Medical therapy of coronary artery disease after percutaneous intervention.	Medical therapy following percutaneous coronary intervention aims at preventing first, coronary disease progression and its clinical manifestations, and finally, the two main complications of coronary stenting, stent thrombosis and restenosis. Prevention of in-stent restenosis is restricted to local drug delivery in the form of drug eluting stents (DES). Second generation DES have improved their efficacy and safety profile by innovations in drug coating, the polymer drug-delivery system and stent design. The mainstay of stent thrombosis prevention remains dual anti-platelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid and a platelet ADP-receptor blocker, traditionally clopidogrel. Two new drugs, prasugrel and ticagrelor, provide faster, greater, and more consistent platelet inhibition than clopidogrel, and have been shown to be more efficacious in preventing ischemic events after PCI in acute coronary syndrome patients.
10577279	A novel mutation of the erythroid-specific gamma-Aminolevulinate synthase gene in a patient with non-inherited pyridoxine-responsive sideroblastic anemia.	A novel missense mutation, G663A, in exon 5 of the erythroid-specific delta-aminolevulinate synthase gene (ALAS2) was identified in a Japanese male with pyridoxine-responsive sideroblastic anemia. Activity of the mutant delta-aminolevulinate synthase protein expressed in vitro was 15.1% compared with the normal control, but was increased up to 34.5% by the addition of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, consistent with the clinical response of the patient to pyridoxine treatment. The same mutation was also detected in genomic DNa from the oral mucosal membrane of the patiet; however, it was not detected in other family member. These findings suggest that this G663A mutation is responsible for sideroblastic anemia in the proband, and may be an index mutation in this pedigree.
10909982	Impaired expression of the uncoupling protein-3 gene in skeletal muscle during lactation: fibrates and troglitazone reverse lactation-induced downregulation of the uncoupling protein-3 gene.	The expression of uncoupling protein (UCP)-3 mRNA in skeletal muscle is dramatically reduced during lactation in mice. The reduction in UCP-3 mRNA levels lowers the amount of the UCP-3 protein in skeletal muscle mitochondria during lactation. Spontaneous or abrupt weaning reverses the downregulation of the UCP-3 mRNA but not the reduction in UCP-3 protein levels. In lactating and virgin mice, however, fasting increases UCP-3 mRNA levels. Changes in UCP-3 mRNA occur in parallel with modifications in the levels of free fatty acids, which are reduced in lactation and are upregulated due to weaning or fasting. Modifications in the energy nutritional stress of lactating dams achieved by manipulating litter sizes do not influence UCP-3 mRNA levels in skeletal muscle. Conversely, when mice are fed a high-fat diet after parturition, the downregulation of UCP-3 mRNA and UCP-3 protein levels due to lactation is partially reversed, as is the reduction in serum free fatty acid levels. Treatment of lactating mice with a single injection of bezafibrate, an activator of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), raises UCP-3 mRNA in skeletal muscle to levels similar to those in virgin mice. 4-chloro-6-[(2,3-xylidine)-pirimidinylthio] acetic acid (WY-14,643), a specific ligand of the PPAR-alpha subtype, causes the most dramatic increase in UCP-3 mRNA, whereas troglitazone, a specific activator of PPAR-gamma, also significantly increases UCP-3 mRNA abundance in skeletal muscle of lactating mice. However, in virgin mice, bezafibrate and WY-14,643 do not significantly affect UCP-3 mRNA expression, whereas troglitazone is at least as effective as it is in lactating dams. It is proposed that the UCP-3 gene is regulated in skeletal muscle during lactation in response to changes in circulating free fatty acids by mechanisms involving activation of PPARs. The impaired expression of the UCP-3 gene is consistent with the involvement of UCP-3 gene regulation in the reduction of the use of fatty acids as fuel by the skeletal muscle and in impaired adaptative thermogenesis, both of which are major metabolic adaptations that occur during lactation.
23620436	A New Proposed Rodent Model of Chemically Induced Prostate Carcinogenesis: Distinct Time-Course Prostate Cancer Progression in the Dorsolateral and Ventral Lobes.	BACKGROUND: Characterization of novel rodent models for prostate cancer studies requires evaluation of either spontaneous and carcinogen-induced tumors as well as tumor incidence in different prostatic lobes. We propose a new short-term rodent model of chemically induced prostate carcinogenesis in which prostate cancer progression occurs differentially in the dorsolateral and ventral lobes. METHODS: Adult gerbils were treated with MNU alone or associated with testosterone for 3 or 6 months of treatment. Tumor incidence, latency, localization, and immunohistochemistry (AR, PCNA, smooth muscle α-actin, p63, MGMT, and E-cadherin) were studied in both lobes. RESULTS: Comparisons between both lobes revealed that lesions developed first in the DL while the VL presented longer tumor latency. However, after 6 months, there was a dramatic increase in tumor multiplicity in the VL, mainly in MNU-treated groups. Lesions clearly progressed from a premalignant to a malignant phenotype over time and tumor latency was decreased by MNU + testosterone administration. Three-dimensional reconstruction of the prostatic complex showed that the DL developed tumors exclusively in the periurethral area and showed intense AR, PCNA, and MGMT immunostaining. Moreover, VL lesions emerged throughout the entire lobe. MNU-induced lesions presented markers indicative of an aggressive phenotype: lack of basal cells, rupture of the smooth muscle cell layer, loss of E-cadherin, and high MGMT staining. CONCLUSIONS: There are distinct pathways involved in tumor progression in gerbil prostate lobes. This animal provides a good model for prostate cancer since it allows the investigation of advanced steps of carcinogenesis with shorter latency periods in both lobes.

16702329	Lutein and eicosapentaenoic acid interact to modify iNOS mRNA levels through the PPARgamma/RXR pathway in chickens and HD11 cell lines.	Two experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of lutein and fat or eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) interaction on inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), PPARs alpha, beta, and gamma, and retinoic acid X receptor (RXR) alpha and gamma mRNA levels. In Expt. 1, macrophages were collected from broiler chicks fed 3 or 6% dietary fat (g/100 g) with 0, 25, and 50 mg lutein/kg feed for 23 d. In Expt. 2, using a 3 x 3 factorial, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) at 0, 15 and 50 micromol/L and lutein at 0, 10 and 100 micromol/L were applied to HD11 cell culture for 24 h. In both experiments, cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide before RNA isolation. Lutein interacted with fat in Expt. 1 and with EPA in Expt. 2 to affect mRNA levels of iNOS, PPARgamma, and RXRalpha in chicken macrophages and HD11 cells, respectively (P < 0.05). At 3% dietary fat or up to 15 micromol/L EPA in the medium, increasing lutein increased the iNOS mRNA. However, at 6% dietary fat or 50 micromol/L EPA, lutein did not cause a rise in iNOS mRNA. Increasing lutein in the medium from 0 to 100 micromol/L decreased iNOS mRNA. Increasing lutein with high fat (6%) or EPA (15 micromol/L EPA) increased PPARgamma and RXRalpha mRNA levels. Lutein increased PPARalpha mRNA levels in both macrophages (P < 0.01) and HD11 (P = 0.01) cells and RXRgamma (P < 0.01) mRNA levels in macrophages. GW9662, a PPARgamma antagonist, prevented (P < 0.01) the lutein-induced iNOS mRNA downregulation in HD11 cells. LG101208, a RXR antagonist, prevented (P < 0.01) iNOS upregulation induced by 10 micromol/L lutein and iNOS mRNA downregulation induced by 100 micromol/L lutein. We conclude that lutein and EPA interact through the PPARgamma and RXR pathways to modulate iNOS mRNA.
10076535	Androgen antagonistic effect of estramustine phosphate (EMP) metabolites on wild-type and mutated androgen receptor.	Estramustine phosphate is used frequently, alone or in combination with other antitumor agents, for the treatment of hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Estramustine phosphate is metabolically activated in vivo, and its metabolites, estramustine, estromustine, estrone, and beta-estradiol inhibit the assembly of microtubules [for review see: Kreis W, In: Concepts, Mechanisms, and New Targets for Chemotherapy (Ed. Muggia FM), pp. 163-184. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston, 1995]. We investigated, by displacement of [3H]methyltrienolone in the presence of 2.5 mM of triamcinolone acetonide, the binding of estramustine phosphate and its metabolites, estramustine, estromustine, estrone, and beta-estradiol, as well as other antiandrogen agents including alpha-estradiol, bicalutamide, and hydroxyflutamide, to the mutated androgen receptor (m-AR) in LNCaP cells and to the wild-type androgen receptor in wild-type AR cDNA expression plasmid (w-pAR0) cDNA-transfected HeLa cells. Analogous to the antiandrogens, bicalutamide and hydroxyflutamide, binding of estramustine phosphate metabolites to the androgen receptor was observed. The EC50 values (in microM) were: estramustine phosphate, > 10; estramustine, 3.129 +/- 0.312; estromustine; 2.612 +/- 0.584; estrone, 0.800 +/- 0.090; alpha-estradiol, 1.051 +/- 0.096; beta-estradiol, 0.523 +/- 0.028; bicalutamide, 4.920 +/- 0.361; and hydroxyflutamide, 0.254 +/- 0.012. The transactivation assay demonstrated that, analogous to bicalutamide, estramustine could not induce luciferase activity in either w-pAR0 or m-pARL transfected HeLa cells. In contrast, a strong induction of the reporter activity by dihydrotestosterone was observed. Down-regulation of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) expression, an AR-target gene, by estramustine and bicalutamide was accompanied by the blockade of the mutated androgen receptor. Exposure of LNCaP cells to estramustine for 24 hr caused transcriptional inhibition of PSA in a concentration-dependent manner. The levels of PSA mRNA decreased 56 and 90% when LNCaP cells were treated with 5 and 10 microM of estramustine, respectively (IC50 = 10.97 +/- 1.68 microM). Binding of hydroxyflutamide to m-AR in LNCaP cells resulted in a concentration-dependent stimulation of PSA expression, suggesting that hydroxyflutamide acted as an agonist of the m-AR. Our data indicate that estramustine phosphate metabolites perform as androgen antagonists of AR, an additional mechanism involved in the therapeutic effect of estramustine phosphate in patients with prostate cancer.
23343421	Cluster phases of decorated micellar solutions with macrocyclic ligands.	An aqueous self-assembled micellar system (sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS, decorated with various adhesive sites, cryptand Kryptofix 222 and crown ether 18-Crown-6 molecules) has been investigated by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) to have insights into the micellar structure, the micellar interactions, and the aggregation properties of the system. DLS demonstrates the existence of populations of aggregates in the submicrometer/micrometer range, while the Guinier analysis of the SAXS curves helps in detailing objects smaller than 30 nm. The aggregates of micelles are here named cluster phases of micelles (CPMs). Considering that SDS micelles in water do not aggregate at low concentration, it is shown that macrocyclic ligands induce the SDS micelle aggregation as a function of the concentration (i.e., investigated ligand/SDS molar ratios are 5.0, 1.5, 1.0, and 0.5) and hydrophobicity of the adhesive sites. The sizes and the percentages of the micelles and the CPMs have been monitored to test the stability and reversibility of the system. DLS results clearly show that the aggregation processes of the decorated micelles are reproducible at time intervals of the order of 1 month, while the stability may not be entirely maintained after a year. As an issue of particular relevance, the higher the ligand/surfactant molar ratio, the larger are the CPMs induced. The K222 ligand results in being more effective in promoting the micellar aggregation than 18C6 as a consequence of the different hydrophobicity.
23163726	The structure and properties of septin 3: a possible missing link in septin filament formation.	The human genome codes for 13 members of a family of filament-forming GTP-binding proteins known as septins. These have been divided into four different subgroups on the basis of sequence similarity. The differences between the subgroups are believed to control their correct assembly into heterofilaments which have specific roles in membrane remodelling events. Many different combinations of the 13 proteins are theoretically possible and it is therefore important to understand the structural basis of specific filament assembly. However, three-dimensional structures are currently available for only three of the four subgroups. In the present study we describe the crystal structure of a construct of human SEPT3 which belongs to the outstanding subgroup. This construct (SEPT3-GC), which includes the GTP-binding and C-terminal domains, purifies as a nucleotide-free monomer, allowing for its characterization in terms of GTP-binding and hydrolysis. In the crystal structure, SEPT3-GC forms foreshortened filaments which employ the same NC and G interfaces observed in the heterotrimeric complex of human septins 2, 6 and 7, reinforcing the notion of 'promiscuous' interactions described previously. In the present study we describe these two interfaces and relate the structure to its tendency to form monomers and its efficiency in the hydrolysis of GTP. The relevance of these results is emphasized by the fact that septins from the SEPT3 subgroup may be important determinants of polymerization by occupying the terminal position in octameric units which themselves form the building blocks of at least some heterofilaments.
23104244	Cytochrome P450-mediated herb-drug interaction potential of Galgeun-tang.	We evaluated the herb-drug interaction potential of Galgeun-tang (GGT) extracts, mediated by cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibition/induction. Further, the effects of fermentation on the CYP-mediated herb-drug interaction potential of GGT extracts were determined. As measured by LC-ESI/MS/MS, GGT extracts (0-300μg/mL) showed no inhibitory activity toward eight CYP isoforms (1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4) in pooled human liver microsomes, suggesting that GGT may have low potential for herb-drug interactions mediated by CYP inhibition. Hepatic CYP expression and activity in rats treated with GGT extracts twice per day for 1week was examined. Among the tested CYP isoforms (1A1, 1A2, 1B1, 2B1, 2C11, 2E1, 3A1, 3A2, and 4A1), CYP1B1 and 4A1 were increased by GGT extracts. Hepatic activities of 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase, 7-pentoxyresorufin-O-depentylase, and chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylase, but not midazolam hydroxylase were also elevated. These results raise the possibility that GGT extracts may increase the toxicity of environmental toxicants through the elevating CYP-dependent metabolic activation. Interestingly, the increases in CYP1B1 and CYP4A1 levels, and 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase, 7-pentoxyresorufin-O-depentylase, and chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylase activities were attenuated by fermentation of GGT extract using Lactobacillus plantarum KFRI 402, but not 144. Further studies are needed to identify the CYP regulatory component(s) from GGT and determination its metabolism.
23129783	Postexposure application of Fas receptor small-interfering RNA to suppress sulfur mustard-induced apoptosis in human airway epithelial cells: implication for a therapeutic approach.	Sulfur mustard (SM) is a vesicant chemical warfare and terrorism agent. Besides skin and eye injury, respiratory damage has been mainly responsible for morbidity and mortality after SM exposure. Previously, it was shown that suppressing the death receptor (DR) response by the dominant-negative Fas-associated death domain protein prior to SM exposure blocked apoptosis and microvesication in skin. Here, we studied whether antagonizing the Fas receptor (FasR) pathway by small-interfering RNA (siRNA) applied after SM exposure would prevent apoptosis and, thus, airway injury. Normal human bronchial/tracheal epithelial (NHBE) cells were used as an in vitro model with FasR siRNA, FasR agonistic antibody CH11, and FasR antagonistic antibody ZB4 as investigative tools. In NHBE cells, both SM (300 µM) and CH11 (100 ng/ml) induced caspase-3 activation, which was inhibited by FasR siRNA and ZB4, indicating that SM-induced apoptosis was via the Fas response. FasR siRNA inhibited SM-induced caspase-3 activation when added to NHBE cultures up to 8 hours after SM. Results using annexin V/propidium iodide-stained cells showed that both apoptosis and necrosis were involved in cell death due to SM; FasR siRNA decreased both apoptotic and necrotic cell populations. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of rats exposed to SM (1 mg/kg, 50 minutes) revealed a significant (P < 0.05) increase in soluble Fas ligand and active caspase-3 in BALF cells. These findings suggest an intervention of Fas-mediated apoptosis as a postexposure therapeutic strategy with a therapeutic window for SM inhalation injury and possibly other respiratory diseases involving the Fas response.
15629255	Effect of bosentan (ETA/ETB receptor antagonist) on metabolic changes during stress and diabetes.	Elevated plasma ET-1 levels have been reported in several conditions such as stress and diabetes. ET-1 is found to cause insulin resistance and to stimulate liver glycogenolysis. The question arises whether ET-1 has a role in the metabolic changes occurring in such conditions. To test this, we studied the possible effect of the endothelin receptor antagonist, bosentan (50 and 100 mg kg(-1)) on serum glucose and insulin levels as well as on liver glycogen contents in normoglycemic stressed animals. In addition, the effect of bosentan on serum glucose and insulin levels in both mild and severely diabetic rats and its effect on insulin-induced hypoglycemia were also determined. Restraining water immersion stress was used as a model for severe stress reported to elevate plasma ET-1 level. Mild diabetes was induced in rats by intraperitoneal injection of a low dose of streptozotocin (38 mg kg(-1)) while severe diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal injection of a higher dose of streptozotocin (45 mg kg(-1)). Bosentan partially prevented stress-induced both hyperglycemia and decrease in glycogen content while it completely blocked the stress-induced decrease in insulin level in normoglycemic stressed rats. Bosentan also decreased serum glucose level without any effect on insulin secretion in mild diabetic rats and potentiated the hypoglycemic action of insulin.
23212047	ADP-ribosylation of guanosine by SCO5461 protein secreted from Streptomyces coelicolor.	The Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) genome encodes a possible secretion protein, SCO5461, that shares a 30% homology with the activity domains of two toxic ADP-ribosyltransferases, pierisins and mosquitocidal toxin. We found ADP-ribosylating activity for the SCO5461 protein product through its co-incubation with guanosine and NAD(+), which resulted in the formation of N(2)-(ADP-ribos-1-yl)-guanosine ((ar2)Guo), with a K(m) value of 110 μM. SCO5461 was further found to ADP-ribosylate deoxyguanosine, GMP, dGMP, GTP, dGTP, and cyclic GMP with k(cat) values of 150-370 s(-1). Oligo(dG), oligo(G), and yeast tRNA were also ADP-ribosylated by this protein, although with much lower k(cat) values of 0.2 s(-1) or less. SCO5461 showed maximum ADP-ribosylation activity towards guanosine at 30 °C, and maintained 20% of these maximum activity levels even at 0 °C. This is the first report of the ADP-ribosylation of guanosine and guanine mononucleotides among the family members of various ADP-ribosylating enzymes. We additionally observed secretion of the putative gene product, SCO5461, in liquid cultures of S. coelicolor. We thus designated the SCO5461 protein product as S. coelicolor ADP-ribosylating protein, ScARP. Our current results could offer new insights into not only the ADP-ribosylation of small molecules but also signal transduction events via enzymatic nucleoside modification by toxin-related enzymes.
23281812	Tetrahydropyrroloquinolinone type dual inhibitors of aromatase/aldosterone synthase as a novel strategy for breast cancer patients with elevated cardiovascular risks.	The application of aromatase inhibitors to postmenopausal breast cancer patients increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), which is believed to be caused by the abnormally high concentrations of aldosterone as a consequence of the estrogen deficiency. Dual inhibitors of aromatase (CYP19) and aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) are therefore proposed as a novel strategy for the adjuvant therapy to reduce the CVD risk for these patients. By combining decisive structural features of CYP11B2 and CYP19 inhibitors into a common template, a series of pyridinylmethyl substituted 1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-pyrrolo[3,2,1-ij]quinolin-4-ones were designed and synthesized. Interestingly, the substituents on the methylene bridge showed strong influences on the inhibitory activities leading to opposite effects, that is, a given substituent showed an increase in inhibition of one enzyme, while it led to a decrease for the other enzyme. The compromise of this conflict led to compounds 3j, 3k, 3n, and 3p as potent and selective dual inhibitors of CYP19 and CYP11B2, especially compound 3p, which exhibited IC(50) values of 32 and 41 nM for CYP19 and CYP11B2, respectively, and a high selectivity toward CYP17 and CYP11B1. This compound is considered as a candidate for further evaluation in vivo.
11383749	Minocycline reduces traumatic brain injury-mediated caspase-1 activation, tissue damage, and neurological dysfunction.	OBJECTIVE: Caspase-1 plays an important functional role mediating neuronal cell death and dysfunction after experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI) in mice. Minocycline, a derivative of the antibiotic tetracycline, inhibits caspase-1 expression. This study investigates whether minocycline can ameliorate TBI-mediated injury in mice. METHODS: Brains from mice subjected to traumatic brain injury underwent immunohistochemical analyses for caspase-1, caspase-3, and a neuronal specific marker (NeuN). Minocycline- and saline-treated mice subjected to traumatic brain injury were compared with respect to neurological function, lesion volume, and interleukin-1beta production. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that activated caspase-1 and caspase-3 are present in neurons 24 hours after TBI. Intraperitoneal administration of minocycline 12 hours before or 30 minutes after TBI in mice resulted in improved neurological function when compared with mice given saline control, as assessed by Rotarod performance 1 to 4 days after TBI. The lesion volume, assessed 4 days after trauma, was significantly decreased in mice treated with minocycline before or after trauma when compared with saline-treated mice. Caspase-1 activity, quantified by measuring mature interleukin-1beta production by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, was considerably increased in mice that underwent TBI, and this increase was significantly diminished in minocycline-treated mice. CONCLUSION: We show for the first time that caspase-1 and caspase-3 activities localize specifically within neurons after experimental brain trauma. Further, these results indicate that minocycline is an effective pharmacological agent for reducing tissue injury and neurological deficits that result from experimental TBI, likely through a caspase-1-dependent mechanism. These results provide an experimental rationale for the evaluation of minocycline in human trauma patients.
23256472	Iodine-129 microdosing for protein and peptide drug development: erythropoietin as a case study.	BACKGROUND: Microdosing is a technique for studying the behavior of compounds in vivo at 1/100th of the dose of a test substance calculated, based on animal data, to yield a pharmacologic effect. In microdosing, use is made of accelerator MS (AMS). In this study, we investigated whether (129)I-labeling of proteins with subsequent AMS measurements is a suitable method to perform microdose studies with therapeutic proteins. We used erythropoietin (EPO) as a case study. RESULTS: In an animal study with (129)I-labeled EPO in Han-Wistar rats, an increase of (129)I-EPO is observed after dose administration. The half-life was found to be 2 and 5.5 h for two different EPOs. These results are in accordance with expected values. CoNCLUSION: Although further research is required, (129)I-labeling of proteins seems a feasible method for AMS microdose studies with peptide and protein drugs, such as biosimilars.
23218401	Ameliorative effect of aspalathin from rooibos (Aspalathus linearis) on acute oxidative stress in Caenorhabditis elegans.	Rooibos leaves and fine stems (Aspalathus linearis; Fabaceae) are increasingly enjoyed as herbal tea, largely in fermented (oxidised) red-brown form, but also in unfermented (unoxidised) green form. Rooibos is rich in antioxidant polyphenols, with the dihydrochalcone, aspalathin, as a major active ingredient. We used Caenorhabditis elegans as model organism to investigate the effect of rooibos extracts against oxidative stress in vivo. In a high glucose environment, C. elegans treated with rooibos extract exhibited an extended lifespan. Furthermore, green rooibos was a more potent antioxidant than red rooibos, probably due to its substantially higher aspalathin content. In addition, rooibos decreased acute oxidative damage caused by the superoxide anion radical generator, juglone, with aspalathin playing a major role in improving the survival rate of C. elegans. Quantitative real-time PCR results demonstrated that aspalathin targets stress and ageing related genes, reducing the endogenous intracellular level of ROS. These findings suggest that rooibos increases stress resistance and promotes longevity under stress, probably mediated via a regulation of the DAF-16/FOXO insulin-like signalling pathway, supporting some of the health claims put forward for rooibos tea.
22963497	A novel reproductive peptide, phoenixin.	Normal anterior pituitary function is essential for fertility. Release from the gland of the reproductive hormones luteinising hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone is regulated primarily by hypothalamically-derived gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH), although other releasing factors (RF) have been postulated to exist. Using a bioinformatic approach, we have identified a novel peptide, phoenixin, that regulates pituitary gonadotrophin secretion by modulating the expression of the GnRH receptor, an action with physiologically relevant consequences. Compromise of phoenixin in vivo using small interfering RNA resulted in the delayed appearance of oestrus and a reduction in GnRH receptor expression in the pituitary. Phoenixin may represent a new class of hypothalamically-derived pituitary priming factors that sensitise the pituitary to the action of other RFs, rather than directly stimulating the fusion of secretary vesicles to pituitary membranes.
16513051	[5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and lifestyle-mediated diseases].	5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an enzyme activated when cellular energy status is threatened. AMPK activates energy-providing processes, while energy-consuming processes are inhibited. AMPK is also involved in regulation of gene expression and in appetite control. Pharmacological activation of AMPK in animal models of the metabolic syndrome leads to marked amelioration of symptoms. Some antidiabetic drugs activate AMPK, and activation also occurs during physical exercise. It is likely that part of the effect of physical activity in preventing the development of diseases related to a sedentary lifestyle is due to activation of AMPK.
23262035	Synthesis, crystal structure and antidiabetic activity of substituted (E)-3-(Benzo [d]thiazol-2-ylamino) phenylprop-2-en-1-one.	A novel series of substituted (E)-3-(Benzo [d]thiazol-2-ylamino)phenylprop-2-en-1-onewere synthesized starting from 2-aminobenzothiazole and 1-aryl-3,3-bis- (methylsulfanyl)-2-propen-1-onesin the presence of a catalytic amount of sodium hydride in THF. The synthesised compounds' structures were confirmed by IR, Mass spectrometry, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and HRMS spectral data. These compounds were evaluated for their antidiabetic activity, and most of the derivatives of (E)-3-(Benzo [d]thiazol-2-ylamino)phenylprop-2-en-1-one displayed significant antidiabetic activity.
17354225	Aberrant regulation of argininosuccinate synthetase by TNF-alpha in human epithelial ovarian cancer.	The pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, TNF-alpha, is dysregulated in malignant compared with normal ovarian surface epithelium (OSE). Several epidemiological studies have associated inflammation with ovarian tumorigenesis, with TNF-alpha playing a key role in modulating invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. Here, we show that TNF-alpha also induces expression of arate-limiting enzyme in arginine synthesis, argininosuccinate synthetase (AS), thereby linking inflammation with several arginine-dependent metabolic pathways, implicated in accelerated carcinogenesis and tumour progression. Having identified AS mRNA induction in TNF-alpha-treated IGROV-1 ovarian cancer cells, using RNA-arbitrarily primed-PCR, we then observed differential regulation of AS mRNA and protein in malignant, compared with normal, OSE cells. A cDNA cancer profiling array with matched normal ovarian and ovarian tumour samples revealed increased expression of AS mRNA in the latter. Moreover, AS protein co-localised with TNF-alpha in ovarian cancer cells, with significantly higher levels of AS in malignant compared with normal ovarian tissue. Increased co-expression of AS and TNF-alpha mRNA was also observed in 2 other epithelial tumours, non-small cell lung and stomach cancer, compared with normal corresponding tissues. In summary, high levels of AS expression, which may be required for several arginine-dependent processes in cancer, including the production of nitric oxide, proline, pyrimidines and polyamines, is regulated by TNF-alpha and may provide an important molecular pathway linking inflammation and metabolism to ovarian tumorigenesis.
11307783	[Long QT syndrome and Brugada syndrome: 2 aspects of the same disease?].	"In clinical cardiology, resort has recently been made to molecular genetics in order to explain some mechanisms that underlie sudden cardiac death in young people with structurally normal hearts. It has become evident that genetic mutations regarding cardiac ion channels may disrupt the delicate balance of currents in the action potential, thus inducing malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias. The cardiac sodium channel gene, SCN5A, is involved in two of such arrhythmogenic diseases, the Brugada syndrome and one form of the long QT syndrome (LQT3). It is believed that these syndromes result from opposite molecular effects: Brugada syndrome mutations cause a reduced sodium current, while LQT3 mutations are associated with a gain of function. The effects of class I antiarrhythmic drugs have been used to differentiate these diseases. Intravenous flecainide is used as a highly specific test to unmask the electrocardiographic phenotype of the Brugada syndrome. On the other hand, on the basis of experimental and clinical studies, the possibility that the same drugs act as a gene-specific therapy in this disorder by contrasting the effect of mutations in LQT3 has been explored. Recent evidence shows that phenotypic overlap may exist between the Brugada syndrome and LQT3. One large family with a SCN5A mutation and a ""mixed"" electrocardiographic pattern (prolonged QT interval and ST-segment elevation) has been reported. Moreover, our recent data showed that flecainide challenge may elicit ST-segment elevation in some LQT3 patients. The presence of ""intermediate"" phenotypes highlights a remarkable heterogeneity suggesting that clinical features may depend upon the single mutation. Only deepened understanding of the genotype-phenotype correlation will allow the definition of the individual patient's risk and the development of guidelines for clinical management."
23375228	Discovery and structure-activity relationships of small molecules that block the human immunoglobulin G-human neonatal Fc receptor (hIgG-hFcRn) protein-protein interaction.	The neonatal Fc receptor, FcRn, prolongs the half-life of IgG in the serum and represents a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of autoimmune disease. Small molecules that block the protein-protein interactions of human IgG-human FcRn may lower pathogenic autoantibodies and provide effective treatment. A novel class of quinoxalines has been discovered as antagonists of the IgG:FcRn protein-protein interaction through optimization of a hit derived from a virtual ligand-based screen.
23291323	In vitro study of intestinal transport of fluoride using the Caco-2 cell line.	Water and food are the main sources of fluoride exposure and therefore it is necessary to study intestinal absorption in order to make a correct evaluation of the risk/benefit associated with exposure to fluoride. The present study characterizes intestinal transport of fluoride, using the Caco-2 cell line as a model of the intestinal epithelium, and evaluates the coefficients of apparent permeability and intracellular accumulation in various conditions (pH, temperature, opening of cell junctions, presence of anions). The results indicate that fluoride is an element with moderate absorption (<70%) in both directions (absorptive and secretory). Both in absorption (apical-basolateral) and in secretion (basolateral-apical) there is transport by the paracellular pathway, which may be considered predominant. Absorption and secretion of fluoride increase at acid pH levels, possibly because of its non-ionized state at these pHs and/or because of participation of a F(-)/H(+) cotransporter or a F(-)/OH(-) antiporter. The results also suggest transcellular participation of mechanisms involved in transport of Cl(-) and of an active transport in the secretory direction. The present study extend the knowledge on the cellular transport of fluoride and provide the basis for future studies aimed at identifying potential transporters involved in human fluoride absorption.
17067304	The effects of adulthood olanzapine treatment on cognitive performance and neurotrophic factor content in male and female rats neonatally treated with quinpirole.	Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were administered quinpirole (1 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline once daily from postnatal day (P)1 to P21. This drug treatment has been shown to produce long-term priming of the D2 receptor. Beginning on P62, rats were administered the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine (2.5 mg/kg) or saline twice daily (i.p.) for 28 days. One day after olanzapine treatment ceased, rats were tested on the place and match-to-place versions of the Morris water maze (MWM) for seven consecutive days. Dopamine D2 receptor priming was verified through a yawning behavioural test, a D2 receptor-mediated event, before olanzapine was administered as well as after olanzapine treatment and behavioural testing were complete. Results showed that neonatal quinpirole treatment induced D2 priming that was eliminated by olanzapine treatment. On the MWM place version, D2-primed rats demonstrated a significant impairment that was eliminated by olanzapine treatment, but olanzapine treatment to animals neonatally treated with saline produced a significant deficit on the place version of the MWM. There were no significant deficits on the match-to-place version. Brain tissue analyses revealed that neonatal quinpirole treatment produced a significant decrease in hippocampal NGF, BDNF and ChAT that was eliminated by olanzapine treatment. Neonatal quinpirole treatment produced a significant decrease in BDNF and ChAT in the frontal cortex that was unaffected by olanzapine treatment. These results show that olanzapine eliminates D2 receptor priming and cognitive impairment and also alleviates decreases in neurotrophins and acetylcholinergic markers produced by D2 priming in the hippocampus.
23349488	The type 2 diabetes associated gene Ide is required for insulin secretion and suppression of α-synuclein levels in β-cells.	Genome wide association studies have identified several type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk loci linked to impaired β-cell function. The identity and function of the causal genes in these susceptibility loci remain, however, elusive. The HHEX/IDE T2D locus is associated with decreased insulin secretion in response to oral glucose stimulation in humans. Here we have assessed β-cell function in Ide knock-out (KO) mice. We find that glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) is decreased in Ide KO mice due to impaired replenishment of the releasable pool of granules and that the Ide gene is haploinsufficient. We also show that autophagic flux and microtubule content is reduced in β-cells of Ide KO mice. One important cellular role for IDE involves the neutralization of amyloidogenic proteins and we find that α-synuclein and IDE levels are inversely correlated in β-cells of Ide KO mice and T2D patients. Moreover, we provide evidence that both gain- and loss-of-function of α-synuclein in β-cells in vivo not only impair GSIS but also autophagy. Together, these data identify the Ide gene as a regulator of GSIS, suggest a molecular mechanism for β-cell degeneration as a consequence of Ide deficiency, and additionally corroborates and extends a previously established important role for α-synuclein in β-cell function.
14596599	Crystal structure of serine dehydratase from rat liver.	SDH (L-serine dehydratase, EC 4.3.1.17) catalyzes the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent dehydration of L-serine to yield pyruvate and ammonia. Liver SDH plays an important role in gluconeogenesis. Formation of pyruvate by SDH is a two-step reaction in which the hydroxyl group of serine is cleaved to produce aminoacrylate, and then the aminoacrylate is deaminated by nonenzymatic hydrolysis to produce pyruvate. The crystal structure of rat liver apo-SDH was determined by single isomorphous replacement at 2.8 A resolution. The holo-SDH crystallized with O-methylserine (OMS) was also determined at 2.6 A resolution by molecular replacement. SDH is composed of two domains, and each domain has a typical alphabeta-open structure. The active site is located in the cleft between the two domains. The holo-SDH contained PLP-OMS aldimine in the active site, indicating that OMS can form the Schiff base linkage with PLP, but the subsequent dehydration did not occur. Apo-SDH forms a dimer by inserting the small domain into the catalytic cleft of the partner subunit so that the active site is closed. Holo-SDH also forms a dimer by making contacts at the back of the clefts so that the dimerization does not close the catalytic cleft. The phosphate group of PLP is surrounded by a characteristic G-rich sequence ((168)GGGGL(172)) and forms hydrogen bonds with the amide groups of those amino acid residues, suggesting that the phosphate group can be protonated. N(1) of PLP participates in a hydrogen bond with Cys303, and similar hydrogen bonds with N(1) participating are seen in other beta-elimination enzymes. These hydrogen bonding schemes indicate that N(1) is not protonated, and thus, the pyridine ring cannot take a quinone-like structure. These characteristics of the bound PLP suggest that SDH catalysis is not facilitated by forming the resonance-stabilized structure of the PLP-Ser aldimine as seen in aminotransferases. A possible catalytic mechanism involves the phosphate group, surrounded by the characteristic sequence, acting as a general acid to donate a proton to the leaving hydroxyl group of serine.
23142789	Effects of octylphenol and bisphenol A on the expression of calcium transport genes in the mouse duodenum and kidney during pregnancy.	Octylphenol (OP) is the degradative product of alkylphenol ethoxylates that are widely used to produce rubber, pesticides, and paints. Bisphenol A (BPA) is an organic compound with two functional phenol groups, and used for manufacturing polycarbonate plastic and epoxy resins, as well as other applications. OP and BPA are known as endocrine disruptors (EDs) with estrogenic activities, and may disturb natural calcium (Ca) metabolism. In the present study, the effects of OP and BPA on Ca levels in the serum and expression of Ca transport genes in the duodenum, and kidney were investigated in pregnant mice. Calbindin refers to several Ca-binding proteins originally described as vitamin D-dependent Ca-binding factors in the intestine, and kidney of birds and mammals. Transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 6 (TRPV6) and transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 5 (TRPV5) are Ca entry channels responsible for Ca absorption in the kidney and intestine, respectively. From 6.5 to 16.5 day post coitus (dpc), pregnant mice were given oral doses of 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE, 0.2mg/kg/day), BPA (5 or 50mg/kg/day), or OP (3, 12, or 48 mg/kg/day) dissolved in corn oil. Samples of the duodenum, kidney, and blood were obtained from the mice on day 17.5 of pregnancy. Serum Ca levels were decreased in the groups treated with OP and BPA. The expression levels of Ca transport genes, TRPV5 and calbindin-D9k (CaBP-9k), in the kidney were decreased after treatment with OP and BPA. Duodenal expression of TRPV6 was also reduced by BPA and OP administration. CaBP-9k expression was differentially regulated by BPA and OP. Transcriptional and translational levels of CaBP-9k were decreased by EE and BPA but increased by a high dose of OP. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that OP and BPA regulated the expression of genes associated with Ca transport in the pregnant mice, which may result in the decreased serum Ca levels.
23598085	Greater impairment of postprandial triacylglycerol than glucose response in metabolic syndrome subjects with fasting hyperglycaemia.	OBJECTIVE: Studies have started to question whether a specific component or combinations of metabolic syndrome (MetS) components may be more important in relation to cardiovascular disease risk. Our aim was to examine the impact of the presence of raised fasting glucose as a MetS component on postprandial lipaemia. METHODS: Men classified with the MetS underwent a sequential test meal investigation, in which blood samples were taken at regular intervals after a test breakfast (t=0 min) and lunch (t=330 min). Lipids, glucose and insulin were measured in the fasting and postprandial samples. RESULTS: MetS subjects with 3 or 4 components were subdivided into those without (n=34) and with (n=23) fasting hyperglycaemia (≥5.6mmol/l), irrespective of the combination of components. Fasting lipids and insulin were similar in the two groups, with glucose significantly higher in the men with glucose as a MetS component (P<0.001). Following the test meals, there were higher maximum concentration (maxC), area under the curve (AUC) and incremental AUC (P≤0.016) for the postprandial triacylglycerol (TAG) response in men with fasting hyperglycaemia. Greater glucose AUC (P<0.001) and insulin maxC (P=0.010) were also observed in these individuals after the test meals. Multiple regression analysis revealed fasting glucose to be an important predictor of the postprandial TAG and glucose response. CONCLUSION: Our data analysis has revealed a greater impairment of postprandial TAG than glucose response in MetS subjects with raised fasting glucose. The worsening of postprandial lipaemic control may contribute to the greater CVD risk reported in individuals with MetS component combinations which include hyperglycaemia.
8793745	AMPA receptor heterogeneity in rat hippocampal neurons revealed by differential sensitivity to cyclothiazide.	1. The kinetics of onset of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor desensitization by glutamate, and the extent of attenuation of AMPA receptor desensitization by cyclothiazide, showed pronounced cell-to-cell variation in cultures of rat hippocampal neurons. Cultures prepared from area CA1 stratum radiatum tended to show weaker modulation by cyclothiazide than cultures prepared from the whole hippocampus. 2. Kinetic analysis of concentration jump responses to glutamate revealed multiple populations of receptors with fast (approximately 400 ms), intermediate (approximately 2-4 s), and slow (> 20 s) time constants for recovery from modulation by cyclothiazide. The amplitudes of these components varied widely between cells, suggesting the existence of at least three populations of AMPA receptor subtypes, the relative density of which varied from cell to cell. 3. The complex patterns of sensitivity to cyclothiazide seen in hippocampal neurons could be reconstituted by assembly of recombinant AMPA receptor subunits generated from cDNAs encoding the flip (i) and flop (o) splice variants of the GluR-A and GluR-B subunits. Recovery from modulation by cyclothiazide was slower for GluR-AiBi and GluR-AoBi than for GluR-AiBo and GluR-AoBo. 4. Coexpression of the flip and flop splice variants of GluR-A, in the absence of GluR-B, revealed that heteromeric AMPA receptors with intermediate sensitivity to cyclothiazide, similar to responses observed for the combinations GluR-AoBi or GluR-AiBo, could be generated independently of the presence of the GluR-B subunit. However, recovery from modulation by cyclothiazide was twofold slower for GluR-AiBi than for homomeric GluR-Ai, indicating that the GluR-A and GluR-B subunits are not functionally equivalent in controlling sensitivity to cyclothiazide. 5. These results demonstrate that AMPA receptors expressed in hippocampal neurons are assembled in a variety of subunit and splice variant combinations that might serve as a mechanism to fine-tune the kinetics of synaptic transmission.
22975155	Mechanism of interaction of novel uncharged, centrally active reactivators with OP-hAChE conjugates.	A library of more than 200 novel uncharged oxime reactivators was used to select and refine lead reactivators of human acetylcholinesterase (hAChE) covalently conjugated with sarin, cyclosarin, VX, paraoxon and tabun. N-substituted 2-hydroxyiminoacetamido alkylamines were identified as best reactivators and reactivation kinetics of the lead oximes, RS41A and RS194B, were analyzed in detail. Compared to reference pyridinium reactivators, 2PAM and MMB4, molecular recognition of RS41A reflected in its Kox constant was compromised by an order of magnitude on average for different OP-hAChE conjugates, without significant differences in the first order maximal phosphorylation rate constant k2. Systematic structural modifications of the RS41A lead resulted in several-fold improvement with reactivator, RS194B. Kinetic analysis indicated Kox reduction for RS194B as the main kinetic constant leading to efficient reactivation. Subtle structural modifications of RS194B were used to identify essential determinants for efficient reactivation. Computational molecular modeling of RS41A and RS194B interactions with VX inhibited hAChE, bound reversibly in Michaelis type complex and covalently in the pentacoordinate reaction intermediate suggests that the faster reactivation reaction is a consequence of a tighter RS194B interactions with hAChE peripheral site (PAS) residues, in particular with D74, resulting in lower interaction energies for formation of both the binding and reactivation states. Desirable in vitro reactivation properties of RS194B, when coupled with its in vivo pharmacokinetics and disposition in the body, reveal the potential of this oxime design as promising centrally and peripherally active antidotes for OP toxicity.
23485615	Platycodi Radix attenuates dimethylnitrosamine-induced liver fibrosis in rats by inducing Nrf2-mediated antioxidant enzymes.	The purpose of this study was to investigate the anti-fibrotic effects of the aqueous extract of the Platycodi Radix root (Changkil: CK) on dimethylnitrosamine (DMN)-induced liver fibrosis in rats. DMN treatment for 4weeks led to marked liver fibrosis as assessed by serum biochemistry, histopathological examination, and hepatic lipid peroxidation and collagen content. CK significantly inhibited DMN-induced increases in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities, fibrosis score, and hepatic malondialdehyde and collagen content. CK also inhibited DMN-induced reductions in rat body and liver weights. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot analyses revealed that CK inhibited DMN-induced increases in matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) mRNA, and collagen type I and α-smooth muscle actin protein. DMN-induced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation was reduced by CK treatment. Furthermore, CK induced activation of nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-mediated antioxidant enzymes such as γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) in HepG2 cells. These results demonstrated that CK attenuates DMN-induced liver fibrosis through the activation of Nrf2-mediated antioxidant enzymes.
10579749	Pharmacological properties of angiotensin II receptor antagonists.	The availability of selective, potent, orally active and long acting nonpeptide angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonists has provided the opportunity to obtain the benefits of selectively blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system at the level of the AT1 receptor that mediates most, if not all, of the important actions of angiotensin II, and avoid the nonspecificity of the angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitors. Losartan was the first, but by no means remained the only, AT1 receptor antagonist. Numerous other 'sartans' have emerged in the past several years and successfully completed clinical development. With the exception of eprosartan, all others, ie, candesartan, irbesartan, saprisartan, tasosartan, telmisartan, valsartan and zolasartan, are based on medications of losartan's prototypical chemical structure. Among the current AT1 receptor antagonists, the rank order of the relative binding affinities (highest affinity = 1) is: candesartan 1, telmisartan 10, E3174 (the active metabolite of losartan) 10, tasosartan 20, losartan 50, eprosartan 100 and the prodrug candesartan cilexetil 280. The mode of (functional) AT1 receptor antagonism has been characterized as surmountable/noncompetitive (losartan, tasosartan, eprosartan) or insurmountable/noncompetitive (candesartan, saprisartan, zolasartan, irbesartan, valsartan, telmisartan, E3174). It is very likely that slow dissociation kinetics from the AT1 receptor underlie insurmountable antagonism. However, competitive or noncompetitive antagonism does not determine the antihypertensive efficacy, but the slow off-rate may extend the occupancy of the AT1 receptor and thereby lengthen the duration of the antihypertensive effect.
23550937	Monocarbonyl Curcumin Analogues: Heterocyclic Pleiotropic Kinase Inhibitors That Mediate Anticancer Properties.	Curcumin is a biologically active component of curry powder. A structurally related class of mimetics possesses similar anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties. Mechanism has been examined by exploring kinase inhibition trends. In a screen of 50 kinases relevant to many forms of cancer, one member of the series (4, EF31) showed ≥85% inhibition for 10 of the enzymes at 5 μM, while 22 of the proteins were blocked at ≥40%. IC50 values for an expanded set of curcumin analogues established a rank order of potencies, and analyses of IKKβ and AKT2 enzyme kinetics for 4 revealed a mixed inhibition model, ATP competition dominating. Our curcumin mimetics are generally selective for Ser/Thr kinases. Both selectivity and potency trends are compatible with protein sequence comparisons, while modeled kinase binding site geometries deliver a reasonable correlation with mixed inhibition. Overall, these analogues are shown to be pleiotropic inhibitors that operate at multiple points along cell signaling pathways.
23189968	Impact of thyroid dysfunction on erythropoietin dosage in hemodialysis patients.	Background: Although thyroid diseases exist in patients with renal failure, thyroid function tests are not routine tests in patients on chronic hemodialysis (HD). Therefore, the impact of thyroid diseases on erythropoietin (EPO) dosage in HD patients is not well defined. This study evaluated the relationship between the dose of EPO and the presence or absence of thyroid dysfunction in HD patients. Methods: This study included 1013 adult patients on HD who did not have a malignancy, liver cirrhosis, thalassemia, iron deficiency, gastrointestinal bleeding, or a major operation within 6 months. Patients were characterized as being euthyroid, or having the sick euthyroid syndrome, primary hypothyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, or subclinical hyperthyroidism based on thyroid function tests. Routine biochemistry profiles including an index of the efficiency of HD, along with clinical data over the previous 6-month period, were collected and analyzed. Multiple regression models were employed to assess the relationship between the dose of EPO and the presence or absence of thyroid status. Results: The mean monthly EPO dosages were 77.7±37.0, 70.2±40.6, 90.8±68.4, 78.5±46.7, and 82.3±41.2 μg, respectively, in the sick euthyroid syndrome, euthyroid patients, hypothyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism, and subclinical hyperthyroidism groups (p<0.05). After adjustment of all other variables in multiple regression, the mean monthly EPO dosage was 19.00±8.59 μg more in hypothyroid patients compared with euthyroid patients (p=0.027). Further, considering an interaction with the presence of diabetes, the mean monthly EPO dosage in patients with either hypothyroidism or subclinical hypothyroidism and diabetes was 54.66±17.12 μg (p=0.001) and 31.51±10.38 μg more than that of euthyroid patients, respectively (p=0.002). Conclusions: In HD patients, the EPO dosage required to maintain the target hemoglobin level is significantly higher in patients having both hypothyroidism or subclinical hypothyroidism and diabetes than in euthyroid patients.
23219161	DNA polymerase POLQ and cellular defense against DNA damage.	In mammalian cells, POLQ (pol θ) is an unusual specialized DNA polymerase whose in vivo function is under active investigation. POLQ has been implicated by different experiments to play a role in resistance to ionizing radiation and defense against genomic instability, in base excision repair, and in immunological diversification. The protein is formed by an N-terminal helicase-like domain, a C-terminal DNA polymerase domain, and a large central domain that spans between the two. This arrangement is also found in the Drosophila Mus308 protein, which functions in resistance to DNA interstrand crosslinking agents. Homologs of POLQ and Mus308 are found in multicellular eukaryotes, including plants, but a comparison of phenotypes suggests that not all of these genes are functional orthologs. Flies defective in Mus308 are sensitive to DNA interstrand crosslinking agents, while mammalian cells defective in POLQ are primarily sensitive to DNA double-strand breaking agents. Cells from Polq(-/-) mice are hypersensitive to radiation and peripheral blood cells display increased spontaneous and ionizing radiation-induced levels of micronuclei (a hallmark of gross chromosomal aberrations), though mice apparently develop normally. Loss of POLQ in human and mouse cells causes sensitivity to ionizing radiation and other double strand breaking agents and increased DNA damage signaling. Retrospective studies of clinical samples show that higher levels of POLQ gene expression in breast and colorectal cancer are correlated with poorer outcomes for patients. A clear understanding of the mechanism of action and physiologic function of POLQ in the cell is likely to bear clinical relevance.
23265530	Physicochemical properties of lard-based diacylglycerols in blends with lard.	The objective of the study was to investigate how blending of triacylglycerols and diacylglycerols affected the melting and crystallisation properties in a solid fat system. Lard-based diacylglycerols (DAGs) were blended with lard in various concentrations (0%, 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100%). The melting and crystallisation properties were investigated by the determination of dropping point (DP), solid fat content (SFC), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). In general, the effects of DAGs were found to be dependent on concentration. The DP was significantly (P<0.0001) decreased when DAGs were added to the lard from 5-50%, whereas the DP was increased (P<0.0001) when the blends contained more than 60% DAGs. The DSC thermograms showed that DAGs changed the melting and crystallisation profiles of lard. The crystallisation onset point increased (P<0.05) with increasing the DAG concentrations (10-100%). The melting peaks and off-set points generally shifted slightly towards higher temperatures as the content of DAGs increased above 50%. DAG content of 5% and 10% resulted in lowering of the off-set point. The lard contained both β and β' crystals. The β form was more pronounced in the blends with high concentrations of DAGs. Blending of TAGs and DAGs may serve as a solution to achieve specific functional properties in products containing solid fats.
16828882	Simvastatin regulates non-neuronal cholinergic activity in T lymphocytes via CD11a-mediated pathways.	Lymphocyte function associated antigen-1 (LFA-1; CD11a/CD18) is an important mediator of leukocyte migration and T cell activation. We previously showed that antithymocyte globulin stimulates an independent, non-neuronal cholinergic system in T cells via LFA-1-mediated pathways, as evidenced by increases in acetylcholine (ACh) synthesis and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) mRNA expression. The cholesterol-lowering drug simvastatin inhibits LFA-1 signaling by binding to an allosteric site on CD11a (LFA-1 alpha chain), which leads to immunomodulation. In the present study, we investigated whether simvastatin modulates lymphocytic cholinergic activity in T cells. We found that anti-CD11a monoclonal antibody (mAb) increased ChAT activity, ACh synthesis and release, and expression of ChAT and M5 muscarinic ACh receptor mRNA in MOLT-3 cells, a human leukemic T cell line. Simvastatin abolished these anti-CD11a mAb-induced increases in lymphocytic cholinergic activity in a manner independent of its cholesterol-lowering activity. These results indicate that LFA-1 contributes to the regulation of lymphocytic cholinergic activity via CD11a-mediated pathways, and suggest that simvastatin exerts its immunosuppressive effects in part via modification of lymphocytic cholinergic activity.
12527923	A novel matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, FYK-1388 suppresses tumor growth, metastasis and angiogenesis by human fibrosarcoma cell line.	The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are likely to contribute to tumor cell invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. Several MMP inhibitors have been developed, recently and their anti-tumor efficacy is being evaluated in clinical trials. FYK-1388 is a novel broad MMP inhibitor which blocks the activity of MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -9, -13 and -14 (MT-MMP-1). It is especially effective against MMP-2 and -9 more so than other MMP inhibitors such as Marimastat, Ro 32-3555 and D-2163. Here, we investigated the anti-tumor efficacy of FYK-1388 using the human fibrosarcoma cell line HT-1080. These cells produced MMP-2 and -9, which FYK-1388 inhibited at a dose of 10(-8) M. FYK-1388 at 0.2 mg/mouse/day significantly suppressed tumor growth when given by s.c. injection for 22 days, experimental lung metastasis after 5 days s.c. injection and also suppressed tumor-induced angiogenesis in the dorsal air sac assay after 7 days s.c. injection. In the MTT assay, FYK-1388 had no effect on the in vitro growth of HT-1080 cells. These results suggest that FYK-1388 possesses anti-tumor efficacy as a result of inhibiting angiogenesis through the suppression of MMP-2 and -9 activity.
23089045	Developmental consequences of the ColQ/MuSK interactions.	CollagenQ (ColQ) is a specific collagen that anchors acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the synaptic basal lamina of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Over 30 mutations in the COLQ gene have been identified that are responsible for a congenital myasthenic syndrome with AChE deficiency, highlighting the importance of this collagen in the physiology of the NMJ. The anchoring of AChE at the synapse requires the interaction of ColQ with MuSK (Muscle-Specific Kinase), a tyrosine kinase expressed on the muscle membrane that is necessary for the formation and the maintenance of the NMJ. MuSK forms with its co-receptor LRP4, a member of the Low-density Related Protein family, a receptor complex for agrin and Wnts, representing the core system from which the postsynaptic domain is built, the growth cone attracted and the presynaptic element instructed for some aspects of its differentiation. Therefore, the discovery that ColQ binds to MuSK prompted us to study a possible regulatory function of ColQ during NMJ development. In this review, after a brief survey on ColQ, we summarize our recent data demonstrating that ColQ, in addition to its anchoring role, exerts signaling functions and controls some aspects of postsynaptic differentiation such as the clustering of acetylcholine receptors. Our results also strengthen the hypothesis that the defects observed in synaptic congenital myasthenic syndromes might be linked, at least in part, to alterations of ColQ signaling functions and not only to AChE deficiency. Finally, we discuss future research directions to understand how ColQ may modulate the action of the other ligands of the MuSK/LRP4 complex and cooperate with them to coordinate the different steps of NMJ formation and maintenance.
23435916	Anti-inflammatory effect of pristimerin on lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory responses in murine macrophages.	Pristimerin, a quinonemethide triterpenoid derived from Celastraceae and Hippocrateaceae, has recently been found to suppress tumor promotion, metastasis and angiogenesis. In the present study, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory potentials of pristimerin in a cell culture system. Pristimerin suppressed not only the generation of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2, but also the expression of inducible NO synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 induced by lipopolysacharide (LPS) in murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Similarly, pristimerin inhibited the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, namely, tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6, induced by LPS. The underlying mechanism of the anti-inflammatory action of pristimerin was correlated with down-regulation of nuclear factor-κB and the mitogen-activated protein kinase signal pathway.
20188727	Phenformin has a direct inhibitory effect on the ATP-sensitive potassium channel.	The biguanides, phenformin and metformin, are used in the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus, as well as being routinely used in studies investigating AMPK activity. We used the patch-clamp technique and rubidium flux assays to determine the role of these drugs in ATP-sensitive K+ channel (K(ATP)) regulation in cell lines expressing the cloned components of K(ATP) and the current natively expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Phenformin but not metformin inhibits a number of variants of K(ATP) including the cloned equivalents of currents present in vascular and non-vascular smooth muscle (Kir6.1/SUR2B and Kir6.2/SUR2B) and pancreatic beta-cells (Kir6.2/SUR1). However it does not inhibit the current potentially present in cardiac myocytes (Kir6.2/SUR2A). The highest affinity interaction is seen with Kir6.1/SUR2B (IC50=0.55 mM) and it also inhibits the current in native vascular smooth muscle cells. The extent and rate of inhibition are similar to that seen with the known K(ATP) blocker PNU 37883A. Additionally, phenformin inhibited the current elicited through the Kir6.2DeltaC26 (functional without SUR) channel with an IC50 of 1.78 mM. Phenformin reduced the open probability of Kir6.1/SUR2B channels by approximately 90% in inside-out patches. These findings suggest that phenformin interacts directly with the pore-forming Kir6.0 subunit however the sulphonylurea receptor is able to significantly modulate the affinity. It is likely to block from the intracellular side of the channel in a manner analogous to that of PNU 37883A.
23042730	Tumor necrosis factor-alpha potentiates the cytotoxicity of amiodarone in Hepa1c1c7 cells: roles of caspase activation and oxidative stress.	Amiodarone (AMD), a class III antiarrhythmic drug, causes idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity in human patients. We demonstrated previously that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) plays an important role in a rat model of AMD-induced hepatotoxicity under inflammatory stress. In this study, we developed a model in vitro to study the roles of caspase activation and oxidative stress in TNF potentiation of AMD cytotoxicity. AMD caused cell death in Hepa1c1c7 cells, and TNF cotreatment potentiated its toxicity. Activation of caspases 9 and 3/7 was observed in AMD/TNF-cotreated cells, and caspase inhibitors provided minor protection from cytotoxicity. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and lipid peroxidation were observed after treatment with AMD and were further elevated by TNF cotreatment. Adding water-soluble antioxidants (trolox, N-acetylcysteine, glutathione, or ascorbate) produced only minor attenuation of AMD/TNF-induced cytotoxicity and did not influence the effect of AMD alone. On the other hand, α-tocopherol (TOCO), which reduced lipid peroxidation and ROS generation, prevented AMD toxicity and caused pronounced reduction in cytotoxicity from AMD/TNF cotreatment. α-TOCO plus a pancaspase inhibitor completely abolished AMD/TNF-induced cytotoxicity. In summary, activation of caspases and oxidative stress were observed after AMD/TNF cotreatment, and caspase inhibitors and a lipid-soluble free-radical scavenger attenuated AMD/TNF-induced cytotoxicity.
16901402	Therapeutic targets in melanoma: map kinase pathway.	Recent progress in our understanding of the genetic alterations that occur in the pathogenesis of melanoma provides exciting opportunities for therapy. The most important signaling pathways in melanoma lie downstream of NRAS: the RAS-BRAF-MAPK pathway. A great deal of attention has been focused on the high mutation rate in the BRAF oncogene, which approaches 60%, because BRAF itself is an appealing drug substrate and because of the central contribution of BRAF function to melanoma development that the mutation rate signifies. Agents that specifically target BRAF, such as sorafenib, as well as new molecules that function both upstream and downstream of BRAF, are being actively investigated.
23416070	Glucagon-induced acetylation of Foxa2 regulates hepatic lipid metabolism.	Circulating levels of insulin and glucagon reflect the nutritional state of animals and elicit regulatory responses in the liver that maintain glucose and lipid homeostasis. The transcription factor Foxa2 activates lipid metabolism and ketogenesis during fasting and is inhibited via insulin-PI3K-Akt signaling-mediated phosphorylation at Thr156 and nuclear exclusion. Here we show that, in addition, Foxa2 is acetylated at the conserved residue Lys259 following inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs) class I-III and the cofactors p300 and SirT1 are involved in Foxa2 acetylation and deacetylation, respectively. Physiologically, fasting states and glucagon stimulation are sufficient to induce Foxa2 acetylation. Introduction of the acetylation-mimicking (K259Q) or -deficient (K259R) mutations promotes or inhibits Foxa2 activity, respectively, and adenoviral expression of Foxa2-K259Q augments expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis. Our study reveals a molecular mechanism by which glucagon signaling activates a fasting response through acetylation of Foxa2.
23455314	Contribution of the m1 transmembrane helix and pre-m1 region to positive allosteric modulation and gating of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors.	N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are glutamate-gated ion channels whose function is critical for normal excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain and whose dysfunction has been implicated in several neurologic conditions. NMDA receptor function is subject to extensive allosteric regulation both by endogenous compounds and by exogenous small molecules. Elucidating the structural determinants and mechanism of action by which allosteric regulators control gating will enhance our understanding of NMDA receptor activation and facilitate the development of novel therapeutics. Here, we investigated the structural determinants for (3-chlorophenyl)(6,7-dimethoxy-1-((4-methoxyphenoxy)methyl)-3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-2(1H)-yl)methanone (CIQ), a GluN2C/2D-selective positive allosteric modulator. We show that CIQ does not bind to the amino-terminal domain of the NMDA receptor and does not share structural determinants with modulators acting at the agonist-binding domain dimer interface or ion channel pore. Rather, we identified critical determinants of CIQ modulation in the region near the first transmembrane helix of GluN2D, including in a putative pre-M1 cuff helix that may influence channel gating. We also show that mutations within the GluN2D pre-M1 region alter open probability of the NMDA receptor. These results suggest a novel site of action for potentiation of NMDA receptors by small molecules and implicate the pre-M1 region in NMDA receptor gating.
13679187	Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of ambenonium derivatives as AChE inhibitors.	Ambenonium (1), an old AChE inhibitor, is endowed with an outstanding affinity and a peculiar mechanism of action that, taken together, make it a very promising pharmacological tool for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Unfortunately, the bisquaternary structure of 1 prevents its passage through the blood brain barrier. In a search of centrally active ambenonium derivatives, we planned to synthesize tertiary amines of 1, such as 2 and 3. In addition, to add new insights into the binding mechanism of the inhibitor, we designed constrained analogues of ambenonium by incorporating the diamine functions into cyclic moieties (4-12). The biological evaluation of the new compounds has been assessed in vitro against human AChE and BChE. All tertiary amine derivatives resulted more than 1000-fold less potent than 1 and, unlike prototype, did not show any selectivity between the two enzymes. This result, because of recent findings concerning the role of BChE in AD, makes our compounds, endowed with a well-balanced profile of AChE/BChE inhibition, valuable candidates for further development. To better clarify the interactions that account for the high affinity of 1, docking simulations and molecular dynamics studies on the AChE-1 complex were also carried out.
15544504	Development of bivalent acetylcholinesterase inhibitors as potential therapeutic drugs for Alzheimer's disease.	At present the only FDA-approved therapy for Alzheimer's disease involves the administration of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, to alleviate the cholinergic deficit associated with this disease. However, none of the approved drugs is ideal in efficacy or tolerability. One possible strategy to improve selectivity and potency is to design drugs that can simultaneously bind to the catalytic and peripheral anionic sites of AChE. In this review we will describe the development of dimeric AChE inhibitors, from the early observations of high inhibition potency by bis-quaternary inhibitors, to the structure-based design of dimers based on tacrine, huperzine A, galanthamine, and polyamines.
23274893	EphA5-EphrinA5 interactions within the ventromedial hypothalamus influence counterregulatory hormone release and local glutamine/glutamate balance during hypoglycemia.	Activation of β-cell EphA5 receptors by its ligand ephrinA5 from adjacent β-cells has been reported to decrease insulin secretion during hypoglycemia. Given the similarities between islet and ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) glucose sensing, we tested the hypothesis that the EphA5/ephrinA5 system might function within the VMH during hypoglycemia to stimulate counterregulatory hormone release as well. Counterregulatory responses and glutamine/glutamate concentrations in the VMH were assessed during a hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic glucose clamp study in chronically catheterized awake male Sprague-Dawley rats that received an acute VMH microinjection of ephrinA5-Fc, chronic VMH knockdown, or overexpression of ephrinA5 using an adenoassociated viral construct. Local stimulation of VMH EphA5 receptors by ephrinA5-Fc or ephrinA5 overexpression increased, whereas knockdown of VMH ephrinA5 reduced counterregulatory responses during hypoglycemia. Overexpression of VMH ephrinA5 transiently increased local glutamate concentrations, whereas ephrinA5 knockdown produced profound suppression of VMH interstitial fluid glutamine concentrations in the basal state and during hypoglycemia. Changes in ephrinA5/EphA5 interactions within the VMH, a key brain glucose-sensing region, act in concert with islets to restore glucose homeostasis during acute hypoglycemia, and its effect on counterregulation may be mediated by changes in glutamate/glutamine cycling.
11278845	Atp-bound topoisomerase ii as a target for antitumor drugs.	Topoisomerase II (TOP2) poisons interfere with the breakage/reunion reaction of TOP2 resulting in DNA cleavage. In the current studies, we show that two different classes (ATP-sensitive and -insensitive) of TOP2 poisons can be identified based on their differential sensitivity to the ATP-bound conformation of TOP2. First, in the presence of 1 mm ATP or the nonhydrolyzable analog adenosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imino)triphosphate, TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage induced by ATP-sensitive TOP2 poisons (e.g. doxorubicin, etoposide, mitoxantrone, and 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide) was 30-100-fold stimulated, whereas DNA cleavage induced by ATP-insensitive TOP2 poisons (e.g. amonafide, batracylin, and menadione) was only slightly (less than 3-fold) affected. In addition, ADP was shown to strongly antagonize TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage induced by ATP-sensitive but not ATP-insensitive TOP2 poisons. Second, C427A mutant human TOP2alpha, which exhibits reduced ATPase activity, was shown to exhibit cross-resistance to all ATP-sensitive but not ATP-insensitive TOP2 poisons. Third, using ciprofloxacin competition assay, TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage induced by ATP-sensitive but not ATP-insensitive poisons was shown to be antagonized by ciprofloxacin. These results suggest that ATP-bound TOP2 may be the specific target of ATP-sensitive TOP2 poisons. Using Lac repressor-operator complexes as roadblocks, we show that ATP-bound TOP2 acts as a circular clamp capable of entering DNA ends and sliding on unobstructed duplex DNA.
23266453	Targeted adenovirus mediated inhibition of NF-κB-dependent inflammatory gene expression in endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo.	In chronic inflammatory diseases the endothelium expresses mediators responsible for harmful leukocyte infiltration. We investigated whether targeted delivery of a therapeutic transgene that inhibits nuclear factor κB signal transduction could silence the proinflammatory activation status of endothelial cells. For this, an adenovirus encoding dominant-negative IκB (dnIκB) as a therapeutic transgene was employed. Selectivity for the endothelial cells was achieved by introduction of antibodies specific for inflammatory endothelial adhesion molecules E-selectin or VCAM-1 chemically linked to the virus via polyethylene glycol. In vitro, the retargeted adenoviruses selectively infected cytokine-activated endothelial cells to express functional transgene. The comparison of transductional capacity of both retargeted viruses revealed that E-selectin based transgene delivery exerted superior pharmacological effects. Targeted delivery mediated dnIκB transgene expression in endothelial cells inhibited the induced expression of several inflammatory genes, including adhesion molecules, cytokines, and chemokines. In vivo, in mice suffering from glomerulonephritis, E-selectin-retargeted adenovirus selectively homed in the kidney to microvascular glomerular endothelium. Subsequent downregulation of endothelial adhesion molecule expression 2 days after induction of inflammation demonstrated the pharmacological potential of this gene therapy approach. The data justify further studies towards therapeutic virus design and optimization of treatment schedules to investigate their capacity to interfere with inflammatory disease progression.
23572405	Circulating glucagon to ghrelin ratio as a determinant of insulin resistance in hyperthyroidism.	Due to stimulated overall metabolism, a state of nutritional inadequacy often ensues, during thyrotoxicosis. We aimed to investigate circulating levels of some major components of the system that regulates energy stores, glucose, and fat metabolism, during thyrotoxicosis compared to euthyroidism. Fasting serum ghrelin, leptin, adiponectin, insulin, glucagon, glucose, as well as body fat composition were analyzed during thyrotoxicosis in 40 hyperthyroid patients (50.5 ± 15.2 years old, 22 females, 31 with Graves disease, and 9 with toxic nodular goiter). The same measurements were repeated an average 3 months later, when all patients achieved euthyroidism. Compared to euthyroidism, in thyrotoxicosis, patients had lower ghrelin and fat mass; had comparable insulin, HOMA-IR, glucagon, and leptin levels; higher levels of circulating adiponectin. Fasting serum glucose tended to be higher during thyrotoxicosis. The unique correlation of HOMA-IR was with the-glucagon to ghrelin ratio-(r = 0.801, p < 0.001) in hyperthyrodism, and with glucagon itself in euthyroidism (r = -0.844, p < 0.001). Circulating levels of ghrelin are decreased; leptin, insulin, glucagon are unchanged; adiponectin are increased during hyperthyroidism. The fasting HOMA-IR tends to be higher, despite the decreased adiposity in hyperthyroidism. The-glucagon to ghrelin ratio-strongly correlates with fasting HOMA-IR in hyperthyroidism.
23295739	Adaptive changes in basal and stress-induced HPA activity in lactating and post-lactating female rats.	Lactation represents a period of marked adaptation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal HPA axis. We characterized basal and stress-induced HPA activity during lactation and experimental weaning using dynamic blood sampling in rats. Pulsatile and diurnal corticosterone release occurred at all reproductive stages studied (virgin; day 10 of lactation; 3 and 14 days after experimental weaning on day 10 of lactation). However, in lactating rats the diurnal peak was significantly reduced, resulting in a flattened rhythm, and three days after weaning, basal HPA activity was markedly suppressed: the number of pulses and underlying basal levels of corticosterone were reduced and the diurnal rise phase delayed. Marked changes in the HPA response to 10 min noise stress also occurred at these times: being completely absent in lactating animals, but restored and highly prolonged in early weaned animals. Injection of methylprednisolone (2 mg, iv) was used to determine whether changes in fast glucocorticoid suppression correlated with these adaptive changes. Methylprednisolone induced a rapid suppression of corticosterone in virgin animals, but this effect was markedly attenuated in lactating and early weaned animals and was accompanied by significant changes in relative expression of hippocampal glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptor mRNA. All effects were reversed or partially reversed 14 days after experimental weaning. Thus, the presence of the pups has an important influence on regulation of the HPA axis, and while postpartum adaptations are reversible, acute weaning evokes marked reorganisation of basal and stress-induced HPA activity.
23567243	DICO, a novel nonaromatic B-ring flavonoid, induces G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human hepatoma cells.	DICO was a novel nonaromatic B-ring flavonoid obtained from Macrothelypteris torresiana. In the present work, we investigated the antitumor activity and the antineoplastic mechanism of DICO. Our study showed that DICO inhibited the growth of HepG2 cells in dose and time-dependent manners. As well as DICO induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via a ROS-mediated mitochondrial pathway. Western blot assay demonstrated that DICO decreased Bcl-2 level and induced Bax translocation to cause cytochrome c release. Subsequently, caspase-9 and caspase-3 were activated. Meanwhile, the alterations of cyclin A and B1, p-CDK1 and p-cdc25c levels were also observed in response to DICO treatment. Taken together, DICO displayed a significant antitumor effect through G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction, which suggested DICO might have therapeutic potential against tumors.
23053666	Claudin-3 and claudin-4 regulate sensitivity to cisplatin by controlling expression of the copper and cisplatin influx transporter CTR1.	Claudin-3 (CLDN3) and claudin-4 (CLDN4) are the major structural molecules that form tight junctions (TJs) between epithelial cells. We found that knockdown of the expression of either CLDN3 or CLDN4 produced marked changes in the phenotype of ovarian cancer cells, including an increase in resistance to cisplatin (cDDP). The effect of CLND3 and CLDN4 on cDDP cytotoxicity, cDDP cellular accumulation, and DNA adduct formation was compared in the CLDN3- and CLDN4-expressing parental human ovarian carcinoma 2008 cells and CLDN3 and CLDN4 knockdown sublines (CLDN3KD and CLDN4KD, respectively). Knockdown of CLDN3 or CLDN4 rendered human ovarian carcinoma 2008 cells resistant to cDDP in both in vitro culture and in vivo xenograft model. The net accumulation of platinum (Pt) and the Pt-DNA adduct levels were reduced in CLDN3KD and CLDN4KD cells. The endogenous mRNA levels of copper influx transporter CTR1 were found to be significantly reduced in the knockdown cells, and exogenous expression of CTR1 restored their sensitivity to cDDP. Reexpression of an shRNAi-resistant CLDN3 or CLDN4 up-regulated CTR1 levels, reversed the cDDP resistance, and enhanced TJ formation in the knockdown cells. Baseline copper (Cu) level, Cu uptake, and Cu cytotoxicity were also reduced in CLDN3KD and CLDN4KD cells. Cu-dependent tyrosinase activity was also markedly reduced in both types of CLDN knockdown cells when incubated with the substrate l-DOPA. These results indicate that CLDN3 and CLDN4 affect sensitivity of the ovarian cancer cells to the cytotoxic effect of cDDP by regulating expression of the Cu transporter CTR1.
23395825	Elevation of 4-hydroxynonenal and malondialdehyde modified protein levels in cerebral cortex with cognitive dysfunction in rats exposed to 1-bromopropane.	1-Bromopropane (1-BP), an alternative to ozone-depleting solvents (ODS), exhibits central nervous system (CNS) toxicity in animals and humans. This study was designed to relate CNS damage by Morris water maze (MWM) test and oxidative stress to 1-BP exposure in the rat. Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 4 groups (n=10), and treated with 0, 200, 400 and 800mg/kgbw 1-BP for consecutive 12 days, respectively. From day 8 to day 12 of the experiment, MWM test was employed to assess the cognitive function of rats. The cerebral cortex of rats was obtained immediately following the 24h after MWM test conclusion. Glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and total thiol (total-SH) content, GSH reductase (GR) and GSH peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities, malondialdehyde (MDA) level, as well as 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and MDA modified proteins in homogenates of cerebral cortex were measured. The obtained results showed that 1-BP led to cognitive dysfunction of rats, which was evidenced by delayed escape latency time and swimming distances in MWM performance. GSH and total-SH content, GSH/GSSG ratio, GR activity significantly decreased in cerebral cortex of rats, coupling with the increase of MDA level. 4-HNE and MDA modified protein levels obviously elevated after 1-BP exposure. GSH-Px activities in cerebral cortex of rats also increased. These data suggested that 1-BP resulted in enhanced lipid peroxidation of brain, which might play an important role in CNS damage induced by 1-BP.
23626400	Novel pentablock copolymer (PLA-PCL-PEG-PCL-PLA) based nanoparticles for controlled drug delivery: Effect of copolymer compositions on the crystallinity of copolymers and in vitro drug release profile from nanoparticles.	The purpose of this investigation was to design novel pentablock copolymers (polylatide-polycaprolactone-polyethylene glycol- polycaprolactone-polylatide) (PLA-PCL-PEG-PCL-PLA) to prepare nanoparticle formulations which provide continuous delivery of steroids over a longer duration with minimal burst effect. Another purpose was to evaluate the effect of poly (L-lactide) (PLLA) or poly (D, L-lactide) (PDLLA) incorporation on crystallinity of pentablock copolymers and in vitro release profile of triamcinolone acetonide (selected as model drug) from nanoparticles. PLA-PCL-PEG-PCL-PLA copolymers with different block ratio of PCL/PLA segment were synthesized. Release of triamcinolone acetonide from nanoparticles was significantly affected by crystallinity of the copolymers. Burst release of triamcinolone acetonide from nanoparticles was significantly minimized with incorporation of proper ratio of PDLLA in the existing triblock (PCL-PEG-PCL) copolymer. Moreover, pentablock copolymer based nanoparticles exhibited continuous release of triamcinolone acetonide. Pentablock copolymer based nanoparticles can be utilized to achieve continuous near zero-order delivery of corticosteroids from nanoparticles without any burst effect.
8797532	Striatal dopamine, dopamine transporter, and vesicular monoamine transporter in chronic cocaine users.	Depletion of striatal dopamine (DA) has been hypothesized to explain some of the neurological and psychiatric complications of chronic use of cocaine, including increased risk for neuroleptic-precipitated movement disorders. We measured levels of DA, as well as two DA nerve terminal indices, namely, the DA transporter (DAT) and the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) in autopsied brain of 12 chronic cocaine users. Mean DA levels were normal in the putamen, the motor component of the striatum; however 4 of the 12 subjects had DA values below the lower limit of the control range. DA concentrations were significantly reduced in the caudate head (head, -33%; tail, -39%) with a trend for reduction in nucleus accumbens (-27%). Striatal DAT protein (-25 to -46%) and VMAT2 (-17 to -22%) were reduced, whereas DAT determined by [3H]WIN 35,428 binding was normal. In conclusion, our data suggest that chronic cocaine use is associated with modestly reduced levels of striatal DA and the DA transporter in some subjects and that these changes might contribute to the neurological and psychiatric effects of the drug.
17899080	Modified expression of coagulation factor VIII by addition of a glycosylation site at the N terminus of the protein.	Recently, it was shown that glycoproteins with N-glycans close to the NH(2) terminus can directly enter the calnexin/calreticulin cycle and bypass BiP binding. This should allow efficient secretion of glycoproteins such as factor VIII (FVIII) whose secretion is negatively affected by BiP interaction. Examination of the glycosylation pattern of the NH(2) terminus of FV and FVIII revealed N-glycans at positions 23 and 27 in FV and at position 41 in FVIII. To improve FVIII secretion, a 14-amino-acid-long polypeptide with (G3) or without (G0; control) three N-linked glycosylation consensus sites was inserted upstream of the NH(2) terminus of a B-domain deleted FVIII protein. Expression of G3- and G0-constructs in three different cell lines resulted in the same or even higher expression rate of protein as found for the B-domain deleted FVIII. However, as demonstrated by Western blot analysis, the G3- as well as the G0-protein variants were mainly retained inside the cells in similar amounts. Thus, glycosylation alone does not automatically lead to higher secretion rates, but must be in context to the normal structure of the FVIII protein.
23348408	Anti-inflammatory activity of patchouli alcohol in RAW264.7 and HT-29 cells.	Patchouli alcohol (PA) is a chemical compound extracted from patchouli which belongs to the genus Pogostemon, herb of mint family. Recently, it has been reported that PA inhibits the production of inflammatory mediators. However, the biological mechanisms of PA for anti-inflammatory activities have not been studied. In this study, we investigated whether PA decreases the production of inflammatory mediators through downregulation of the NF-κB and ERK pathway. Our data indicated that PA inhibits the over-expression of iNOS and IL-6 in protein and mRNA levels in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 and TNF-α stimulated HT-29 cells. PA inhibited IκB-α degradation and p65 nuclear translocation, and subsequently suppressed transcriptional activity of NF-κB in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 and TNF-α-stimulated HT-29 cells. In addition, PA inhibited LPS- or TNF-α-stimulated ERK1/2 activation by decreasing phosphorylation of ERK1/2. These findings suggest that PA shows anti-inflammatory activities through suppressing ERK-mediated NF-κB pathway in mouse macrophage and human colorectal cancer cells.
23209285	Functional requirement for a highly conserved charged residue at position 75 in the gap junction protein connexin 32.	Charcot Marie Tooth disease (CMT) is a group of inherited disorders characterized clinically by exclusively or predominantly peripheral nerve dysfunction. CMT1X, the most common form of X-linked CMT is caused by mutations in connexin 32 (Cx32). In this work, we used dual whole cell patch clamp recording to examine the functional effects of mutations at the Arg(75) position. This residue is highly conserved among members of the connexin family, and disease-causing mutations have been identified at this (or the corresponding) position in Cx26, Cx43, and Cx46. Thus, a better understanding of the effects of mutations of this position in Cx32 may have relevance to pathogenesis of a number of different human diseases. All three mutants associated with CMT1X (R75P, R75Q, and R75W) showed very low levels of coupling similar to those of the cells transfected with vector alone. Heterotypic pairing with Cx32 WT showed that the absence of coupling for these mutants in the homotypic configuration could be explained by shifts in their hemichannel G(j)-V(j) relations. Examination of the expression levels and gating characteristics of seven additional mutants (R75A, R75D, R75E, R75H, R75K, R75L, and R75V) at this position suggest that the positive charge at position 75 in Cx32 is required for normal channel function but not for gap junction assembly. Our studies also suggest that disease treatment strategies for CMT1X, which correct trafficking abnormalities in Cx32, may be ineffective for the group of mutations also conferring changes in gating properties of Cx32 channels.
3532684	Activities of some antioxidative and hexose monophosphate shunt enzymes of skeletal muscle in neuromuscular diseases.	The activities of some antioxidative and hexose monophosphate shunt enzymes, as well as of 2 hydrolases were studied in skeletal muscle biopsy specimens taken from 39 patients with neuromuscular diseases and from 15 controls. The activity of Se-dependent glutathione peroxidase was higher in patients with congenital myotonia, whereas in the other diagnostic groups this enzyme activity was the same as in the controls. The Se-independent and total glutathione peroxidase activity of patients in the various diagnostic groups did not differ from the controls. Moreover, no difference were observed in catalase activity between the patient groups and the controls. The activities of the rate limiting enzymes of hexose monophosphate shunt, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase of muscle biopsy samples of various patient groups did not show any significant difference from controls. The activity of a lysosomal hydrolase, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, was increased in patients with polyneuropathy and the activity of a nonlysosomal protease, alkaline protease, was high in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. The activities of Se-dependent glutathione peroxidase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and of both hydrolases showed a significant correlation to the magnitude of muscle atrophy.
23165153	Pathophysiological roles of aldo-keto reductases (AKR1C1 and AKR1C3) in development of cisplatin resistance in human colon cancers.	Cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum, CDDP) is widely used for treatment of patients with solid tumors formed in various organs including the lung, prostate and cervix, but is much less sensitive in colon and breast cancers. One major factor implicated in the ineffectiveness has been suggested to be acquisition of the CDDP resistance. Here, we established the CDDP-resistant phenotypes of human colon HCT15 cells by continuously exposing them to incremental concentrations of the drug, and monitored expressions of aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) 1A1, 1B1, 1B10, 1C1, 1C2 and 1C3. Among the six AKRs, AKR1C1 and AKR1C3 are highly induced with the CDDP resistance. The resistance lowered the sensitivity toward cellular damages evoked by oxidative stress-derived aldehydes, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal and 4-oxo-2-nonenal that are detoxified by AKR1C1 and AKR1C3. Overexpression of AKR1C1 or AKR1C3 in the parental HCT15 cells mitigated the cytotoxicity of the aldehydes and CDDP. Knockdown of both AKR1C1 and AKR1C3 in the resistant cells or treatment of the cells with specific inhibitors of the AKRs increased the sensitivity to CDDP toxicity. Thus, the two AKRs participate in the mechanism underlying the CDDP resistance probably via detoxification of the aldehydes resulting from enhanced oxidative stress. The resistant cells also showed an enhancement in proteolytic activity of proteasome accompanied by overexpression of its catalytic subunits (PSMβ9 and PSMβ10). Pretreatment of the resistant cells with a potent proteasome inhibitor Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-al augmented the CDDP sensitization elicited by the AKR inhibitors. Additionally, the treatment of the cells with Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-al and the AKR inhibitors induced the expressions of the two AKRs and proteasome subunits. Collectively, these results suggest the involvement of up-regulated AKR1C1, AKR1C3 and proteasome in CDDP resistance of colon cancers and support a chemotherapeutic role for their inhibitors.
23265526	The antioxidant activity of teas measured by the FRAP method adapted to the FIA system: optimising the conditions using the response surface methodology.	This study proposes a FRAP assay adapted to FIA system with a merging zones configuration. The FIA system conditions were optimised with the response surface methodology using the central composite rotatable design. The optimisation parameters studied were: the carrier flow rate, the lengths of the sample and reagent loops, and reactor length. The conditions selected in accordance with the results were: carrier flow rate of 1.00 ml/min, length of the loops 18.2 cm and length of the reaction coil 210.1 cm. The detection and quantification limits were, respectively, 28.6 and 86.8 μmol/l Fe(2+), and the precision was 1.27%. The proposed method had an analytical frequency of 30 samples/h and about 95% less volume of FRAP reagent was consumed. The FRAP assay adapted to the FIA system under the optimised conditions was utilised to determine the antioxidant activity of tea samples.
22818713	Silibinin protects H9c2 cardiac cells from oxidative stress and inhibits phenylephrine-induced hypertrophy: potential mechanisms.	Cardiac hypertrophy is the main response of the heart to various extrinsic and intrinsic stimuli, and it is characterized by specific molecular and phenotypic changes. Recent in vitro and in vivo studies indicate the involvement of reactive oxygen species in the hypertrophic response. In this study, silibinin, a plant flavonolignan extracted from milk thistle with potent antioxidant activity, was evaluated for its effects in (a) preventing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced cellular damage and (b) blocking the phenylephrine-induced hypertrophic response. Using the in vitro model of embryonic rat heart-derived H9c2 cells, we showed that silibinin has a rather safe profile as concentrations up to 200μM did not affect cell viability. Pretreatment of H9c2 cells with silibinin resulted in better protection of H9c2 cells under conditions of H2O2-induced cellular stress compared to untreated cells as indicated by cell viability and DNA fragmentation assays. Furthermore, silibinin attenuated the phenylephrine-induced hypertrophic response as evidenced by the measurement of cell surface, up-regulation of atrial natriuretic peptide and increase of cellular protein levels. Moreover, silibinin repressed the phenylephrine-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 kinases, while it appeared to inhibit the weakly activated by phenylephrine phosphorylation of Akt. Based on our results, silibinin may attenuate the phenylephrine-induced hypertrophic response of H9c2 cells via antioxidant mechanisms involving mainly the inhibition of the intracellular signaling pathways mediated by ERK1/2 MAPKs and Akt.
14616353	Imiquimod in basal cell carcinoma: how does it work?	Imiquimod is a topical immune response modifier that binds to Toll-like receptor-7 and -8, inducing interferon-alpha. We treated superficial basal cell carcinomas (BCC) with imiquimod 5% cream daily for 5-8 days. The BCC lesions were biopsied before treatment and following imiquimod treatment, when the lesion showed the signs of erosion. We applied histology, immunohistochemistry and gene array technology (Affymetrix) to gain further insight into the mode of action of imiquimod. Our findings demonstrate that imiquimod-induced BCC regression is associated with a strong activity of the innate immune response, mediated by cells of macrophage-monocyte origin and is associated with the induction of apoptosis.
17003348	Imaging docking and fusion of insulin granules induced by antidiabetes agents: sulfonylurea and glinide drugs preferentially mediate the fusion of newcomer, but not previously docked, insulin granules.	Sulfonylurea and glinide drugs, commonly used for antidiabetes therapies, are known to stimulate insulin release from pancreatic beta-cells by closing ATP-sensitive K+ channels. However, the specific actions of these drugs on insulin granule motion are largely unknown. Here, we used total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to analyze the docking and fusion of single insulin granules in live beta-cells exposed to either the sulfonylurea drug glibenclamide or the glinide drug mitiglinide. TIRF images showed that both agents caused rapid fusion of newcomer insulin granules with the cell membrane in both control and diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat pancreatic beta-cells. However, in the context of beta-cells from sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) knockout mice, TIRF images showed that only mitiglinide, but not glibenclamide, caused fusion of newcomer insulin granules. Compositely, our data indicate that 1) the mechanism by which both sulfonylurea and glinide drugs promote insulin release entails the preferential fusion of newcomer, rather than previously docked, insulin granules, and that 2) mitiglinide can induce insulin release by a mechanism independent of mitiglinide binding to SUR1.
22532505	Extracts of Scutellaria baicalensis reduced body weight and blood triglyceride in db/db Mice.	Scutellaria baicalensis has been extensively employed for the clinical treatment of hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis, hypertension, dysentery, inflammatory diseases, and the common cold. The present study was performed to investigate the anti-obesity and anti-dyslipidemia effect of Scutellaria baicalensis extracts (SBE) in type 2 diabetic db/db mice. Male db/db mice were divided into three groups (n = 5) and orally administrated vehicle (control), SBE 10, and 100 mg/kg body weight/day for 4 weeks everyday. Administration of SBE improves weight gain, hypertriglyceridemia, and hyperinsulinemia in db/db mice. In obese db/db mice, SBE treatment also reduced plasma alanine aminotransferase levels. In the livers of db/db mice, SBE promoted 5' AMP-activated protein kinase activity and restored metabolic process and insulin signaling pathways. Our data demonstrate that SBE exerts potent anti-obesity and anti-hypertriglyceride effects suggesting its useful potential function as adjuvant therapeutic agent for the treatment of weight gain and hypertriglyceridemia.
1611705	Effect of amrinone on tumor necrosis factor production in endotoxic shock.	Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a macrophage-derived mediator responsible for many of the pathophysiologic manifestations of endotoxic shock. We now demonstrate that amrinone, a noncatechol inotrope, strongly inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced TNF production at concentrations readily achieved in vivo. This inhibition is apparent in murine macrophages, in macrophage cell lines, in vivo, and in cell lines containing a reporter gene construct that substitutes the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) coding sequence for the TNF coding sequence and introns. Inhibition by amrinone (like inhibition by pentoxifylline) is manifested at the level of mRNA accumulation, in contrast to inhibition caused by dexamethasone. Combined application of dexamethasone and amrinone caused additive inhibition of TNF biosynthesis in vitro. Furthermore, treatment of mice with amrinone immediately prior to endotoxin challenge led to significantly improved survival. These findings suggest that amrinone possesses antiinflammatory as well as inotropic properties that may make it an appropriate agent for use in septic shock or other serious bacterial infections. Abrupt removal of amrinone or pentoxifylline from the culture medium prior to LPS stimulation, however, caused significantly augmented TNF production. Therefore, amrinone and other phosphodiesterase inhibitors may also enhance sensitivity to LPS during a period of time following discontinuation of therapy.
10709635	Carnitine biosynthesis. Purification of gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylase from rat liver.	gamma-Butyrobetaine hydroxylase catalyse the last step in carnitine biosynthesis, the formation of L-carnitine from gamma-butyrobetaine, a reaction dependent on Fe2+, alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate and oxygen. Initial attempts to purify the protein from rat liver showed that gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylase is unstable. We, therefore, determined the influence of various compounds on the stability of gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylase at different storage temperatures. The enzyme activity was best conserved by storing the protein at 4 degrees C in the presence of 200 g/l glycerol and 10 mM DTT. We subsequently purified the enzyme from rat liver to apparent homogeneity by liquid chromatography.
11252887	Gemcitabine and Pemetrexed disodium in treating breast cancer.	Pemetrexed disodium (Alimta, LY231514) is a novel, multitargeted antifolate that inhibits thymidylate synthase, dihydrofolate reductase, and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyl transferase. This agent is broadly active in a wide variety of solid tumors, including breast cancer. Pemetrexed disodium has also shown clinically relevant activity in combination with gemcitabine (Gemzar). This combination is being evaluated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.
10839989	Contrasting effects of N5-substituted tetrahydrobiopterin derivatives on phenylalanine hydroxylase, dihydropteridine reductase and nitric oxide synthase.	Tetrahydrobiopterin [(6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-L-biopterin, H(4)biopterin] is one of several cofactors of nitric oxide synthases (EC 1.14.13.39). Here we compared the action of N(5)-substituted derivatives on recombinant rat neuronal nitric oxide synthase with their effects on dihydropteridine reductase (EC 1.6.99.7) and phenylalanine hydroxylase (EC 1.14.16.1),the well-studied classical H(4)biopterin-dependent reactions. H(4)biopterin substituted at N(5) with methyl, hydroxymethyl, formyl and acetyl groups were used. Substitution at N(5) occurs at a position critical to the redox cycle of the cofactor in phenylalanine hydroxylase/dihydropteridine reductase. We also included N(2)'-methyl H(4)biopterin, a derivative substituted at a position not directly involved in redox cycling, as a control. As compared with N(5)-methyl H(4)biopterin, N(5)-formyl H(4)biopterin bound with twice the capacity but stimulated nitric oxide synthase to a lesser extent. Depending on the substituent used, N(5)-substituted derivatives were redox-active: N(5)-methyl- and N(5)-hydroxyl methyl H(4)biopterin, but not N(5)-formyl- and N(5)-acetyl H(4)biopterin, reduced 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol. N(5)-Substituted H(4)biopterin derivatives were not oxidized to products serving as substrates for dihydropteridine reductase and,depending on the substituent, were competitive inhibitors of phenylalanine hydroxylase: N(5)-methyl- and N(5)-hydroxymethyl H(4)biopterin inhibited phenylalanine hydroxylase, whereas N(5)-formyl- and N(5)-acetyl H(4)biopterin had no effect. Our data demonstrate differences in the mechanism of stimulation of phenylalanine hydroxylase and nitric oxide synthase by H(4)biopterin. They are compatible with a novel, non-classical, redox-active contribution of H(4)biopterin to the catalysis of the nitric oxide synthase reaction.
2832297	Loperamide modifies but does not block the corticotropin-releasing hormone-induced ACTH response in patients with Addison's disease.	The effect of loperamide - a peripheral opiate agonist - on plasma ACTH response to Corticotropin-releasing Hormone (CRH) has been investigated in 6 patients with Addison's disease. After placebo administration CRH induced a marked ACTH increase. After loperamide administration ACTH levels fell to a nadir of 135 +/- 76 pg/ml, and then CRH was still able to induce an ACTH increase; the pattern of ACTH response to CRH was slightly delayed. There was a significant difference between the two ACTH curves after CRH only in the early phase of the response. These data suggest that the inhibitory role of loperamide on ACTH secretion is exerted at supra-pituitary level, although a pituitary site of action can not be excluded.
17290783	[Construction of the flavinogenic yeast Candida famata strains with high riboflavin kinase activity using gene engineering].	The recombinant strains of the flavinogenic yeast Candida famata, which contain the DNA fragment consisting of the FMN1 gene (encoding the riboflavin kinase, enzyme that converts riboflavin to flavinmononucleotide) driven by the strong promoters (the regulated RIB1 or constitutive TEF1 promoter) were isolated. Riboflavin kinase activity in the isolated transformants was tested. The 6-8-fold increase of the riboflavin kinase activity was shown in the recombinant strains containing the integrated Debaryomyces hansenii FMN1 gene under the strong constitutive TEF1 promoter. The recombinant strains can be used for the following construction of flavinmononucleotide overproducers.
23223234	The fidelity of transcription: RPB1 (RPO21) mutations that increase transcriptional slippage in S. cerevisiae.	The fidelity of RNA synthesis depends on both accurate template-mediated nucleotide selection and proper maintenance of register between template and RNA. Loss of register, or transcriptional slippage, is particularly likely on homopolymeric runs in the template. Transcriptional slippage can alter the coding capacity of mRNAs and is used as a regulatory mechanism. Here we describe mutations in the largest subunit of Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA polymerase II that substantially increase the level of transcriptional slippage. Alleles of RPB1 (RPO21) with elevated slippage rates were identified among 6-azauracil-sensitive mutants and were also isolated using a slippage-dependent reporter gene. Biochemical characterization of polymerase II isolated from these mutants confirms elevated levels of transcriptional slippage.
16469680	Prevalence and mechanism of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced clinical relapse in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: It has been variably suggested that nonselective NSAIDs and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 selective inhibitors aggravate or ameliorate clinical disease activity in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. We assessed the effect of these drugs in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (n = 209) and the possible mechanisms. METHODS: First, patients with quiescent Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis received the non-NSAID analgesic acetaminophen (n = 26) and the conventional NSAIDs naproxen (n = 32), diclofenac (n = 29), and indomethacin (n = 22) for 4 weeks. The Harvey-Bradshaw index was used to define relapse. Second, to assess the mechanism of relapse, intestinal inflammation was quantitated (fecal calprotectin) before and during treatment (20 patients/group) with acetaminophen, naproxen (topical effect, COX-1 and -2 inhibitor), nabumetone (COX-1 and -2 inhibitor), nimesulide (selective COX-2 inhibitor), and low-dose aspirin (selective COX-1 inhibition). RESULTS: Nonselective NSAIDs were associated with a 17%-28% relapse rate within 9 days of ingestion. No patient had an early relapse on acetaminophen, nimesulide, or aspirin, whereas those on naproxen and nabumetone (20%) experienced relapse. These clinical relapses were associated with escalating intestinal inflammatory activity. CONCLUSIONS: NSAID ingestion is associated with frequent and early clinical relapse of quiescent inflammatory bowel disease, and the mechanism appears to be due to dual inhibition of the COX enzymes. Selective COX-2 inhibition with nimesulide and COX-1 inhibition with low-dose aspirin appear to be well-tolerated in the short-term.
14659797	Serotonin 5-HT(2B) receptor loss of function mutation in a patient with fenfluramine-associated primary pulmonary hypertension.	OBJECTIVE: Appetite-suppressant drug fenfluramine is implicated in primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) but the molecular pathways that mediate this effect are unknown. A mouse model incriminates the serotonin 5-HT(2B) receptor but contrasts with other models where this receptor has been shown to mediate pulmonary arterial relaxation via nitric oxide production. METHODS: We analyzed the human 5-HT(2B) gene in 10 patients with appetite-suppressant drug-associated PPH. RESULTS: A mutation causing premature truncation of the protein product was found in one patient. The mutation was not found in 80 control subjects and no 5-HT(2B) mutation was found in 18 PPH patients not associated with appetite-suppressants. Functional analysis of the transfected receptor expressed either transiently in COS cells or stably in CHO cells demonstrated that the mutated receptor fails to activate the second messenger inositol-phosphates cascade and subsequent intracellular calcium release, in spite of normal expression at the cell membrane. The mutated receptor had no constitutive activity, and produced no dominant negative effect on the wild-type receptor. CONCLUSION: Loss of serotonin 5-HT(2B) receptor function may predispose to fenfluramine-associated PPH in man.
2583270	Alkaloid homoharringtonine inhibits polypeptide chain elongation on human ribosomes on the step of peptide bond formation.	The aim of the present study was to investigate homoharringtonine alkaloid effect on: (i) the nonenzymatic and eEF-1-dependent Phe-tRNAPhe binding to poly(U)-programmed human placenta 80 S ribosomes; (ii) diphenylalanine synthesis accompanying nonenzymatic Phe-tRNAPhe binding; and (iii) acetylphenylalanyl-puromycin formation. Neither nonenzymatic nor eEF-1-dependent Phe-tRNAPhe binding were noticeably affected by the alkaloid, whereas diphenylalanine synthesis and puromycin reaction were strongly inhibited by homoharringtonine. It has been proposed that the site of homoharringtonine binding on 80 S ribosomes should overlap or coincide with the acceptor site of the ribosome.
10954021	Accumulation of cystathionine, cystathionine ketimine, and perhydro-1,4-thiazepine-3,5-dicarboxylic acid in whole brain and various regions of the brain of D, L-propargylglycine-treated rats.	Experimental cystathioninuria was induced in rats by administration of the cystathionine gamma-lyase inhibitor, D,L-propargylglycine. The cystathionine metabolites, cystathionine ketimine (CK) and perhydro-1,4-thiazepine-3,5-dicarboxylic acid (PHTZDC), were identified in whole brain and various regions of the brain in D,L-propargylglycine-treated rats. The concentration of CK and PHTZDC in whole brain and various regions of the brain increased gradually after administration of D,L-propargylglycine, and reached the highest value at about 20 hours. CK and PHTZDC accumulated in whole brain and various regions of the brain in proportion to the amount of accumulated cystathionine after D,L-propargylglycine administration. The concentration of these compounds in the cerebellum was higher versus the other regions of the rat brain.
7500004	Sodium-dependent norepinephrine-induced currents in norepinephrine-transporter-transfected HEK-293 cells blocked by cocaine and antidepressants.	Transport of norepinephrine (NE+) by cocaine- and antidepressant-sensitive transporters in presynaptic terminals is predicted to involve the cotransport of Na+ and Cl-, resulting in a net movement of charge per transport cycle. To explore the relationship between catecholamine transport and ion permeation through the NE transporter, we established a human norepinephrine transporter (hNET) cell line suitable for biochemical analysis and patch-clamp recording. Stable transfection of hNET cDNA into HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney) cells results in lines exhibiting (1) a high number of transporter copies per cell (10(6)), as detected by radioligand binding and hNET-specific antibodies, (2) high-affinity, Na(+)-dependent transport of NE, and (3) inhibitor sensitivities similar to those of native membranes. Whole-cell voltage-clamp of hNET-293 cells reveals NE-induced, Na(+)-dependent currents blocked by antidepressants and cocaine that are absent in parental cells. In addition to NE-dependent currents, transfected cells posses an NE-independent mode of charge movement mediated by hNET. hNET antagonists without effect in non-transfected cells abolish both NE-dependent and NE-independent modes of charge movement in transfected cells. The magnitude of NE-dependent currents in these cells exceeds the expectations of simple carrier models using previous estimates of transport rates. To explain our observations, we propose that hNETs function as ion-gated ligand channels with an indefinite stoichiometry relating ion flux to NE transport. In this view, external Na+ and NE bind to the transporter with finite affinities in a cooperative fashion. However, coupled transport may not predict the magnitude or the kinetics of the total current through the transporter. We propose instead that Na+ gates NE transport and also the parallel inward flux of an indeterminate number of ions through a channel-like pore.
17408613	Hypophagic effect of the angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist irbesartan in rats.	Recent experimental and clinical studies report beneficial metabolic effects of antihypertensive drugs interfering with angiotensin. Antagonists at the angiotensin AT(1) receptor can reduce blood glucose and triglyceride levels. So far, there is little evidence, however, that angiotensin AT(1) receptor antagonists can also affect food intake. Particularly unknown is if drugs of this class can have acute effects on short term feeding. To address this issue, the angiotensin AT(1) receptor antagonist irbesartan was studied in a one-hour feeding paradigm in rats. In this study, irbesartan was investigated in comparison with fenfluramine, an established satiating drug, and the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril. We found a significant reduction of one-hour food intake following 100-200 mg/kg (i.p.) irbesartan. The ACE inhibitor captopril (25-100 mg/kg i.p.) remained without effect on food intake and fenfluramine showed the expected hypophagic action starting at 1 mg/kg (i.p.). The hypophagic effect of irbesartan could not be attributed to sedation or any gross effect on motor activity as determined both upon feeding and independent activity experiments. Fenfluramine (1 mg/kg) and irbesartan (100 mg/kg) did not reduce the latency to feed, but similarly reduced the eating rate at the beginning of the test meal. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates a hypophagic effect of the angiotensin AT(1) receptor antagonist irbesartan that cannot be attributed to sedation or antidipsic effects of the drug.
23421617	Impact of model perfume molecules on the self-assembly of anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl 6-benzene sulfonate.	The impact of two model perfumes with differing degrees of hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity, linalool (LL) and phenylethanol (PE), on the solution structure of anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl 6-benzene sulfonate, LAS-6, has been studied by small angle neutron scattering, SANS. For both types of perfume molecules, complex phase behavior is observed. The phase behavior depends upon the concentration, surfactant/perfume composition, and type of perfume. The more hydrophilic perfume PE promotes the formation of more highly curved structures. At relatively low surfactant concentrations, small globular micelles, L1, are formed. These become perfume droplets, L(sm), stabilized by the surfactant at much higher perfume solution compositions. At higher surfactant concentrations, the tendency of LAS-6 to form more planar structures is evident. The more hydrophobic linalool promotes the formation of more planar structures. Combined with the greater tendency of LAS-6 to form planar structures, this results in the planar structures dominating the phase behavior for the LAS-6/linalool mixtures. For the LAS-6/linalool mixture, the self-assembly is in the form of micelles only at the lowest surfactant and perfume concentrations. Over most of the concentration-composition space explored, the structures are predominantly lamellar, L(α), or vesicle, L(v), or in the form of a lamellar/micellar coexistence. At low and intermediate amounts of LL, a significantly different structure is observed, and the aggregates are in the form of small, relatively monodisperse vesicles (i.e., nanovesicles), L(sv).
23122098	Identification of a novel phenolic compound in litchi (Litchi chinensis Sonn.) pericarp and bioactivity evaluation.	Litchi (Litchi chinensis Sonn.) is a delicious fruit widely accepted by consumers all over the world. In this work, phytochemical investigation of litchi pericarp methanol extracts led to the isolation of a novel phenolic, 2-(2-hydroxyl-5-(methoxycarbonyl) phenoxy) benzoic acid, together with kaempferol, isolariciresinol, stigmasterol, butylated hydroxytoluene, 3,4-dihydroxyl benzoate, methyl shikimate and ethyl shikimate. Most were found in litchi pericarp for the first time. Their structures were mainly elucidated by NMR and MS evidences. Antioxidant activities of the eight compounds were determined by a DPPH radical scavenging assay and the results showed that 2-(2-hydroxy-5-(methoxycarbonyl) phenoxy)benzoic acid, kaempferol, isolariciresinol, butylated hydroxytoluene and 3,4-dihydroxy benzoate exhibited good antioxidant activities. An interesting finding was that butylated hydroxytoluene was detected as a natural antioxidant in this work, which was usually taken as a synthesized antioxidant. Furthermore, the novel compound exhibited no inhibitory effects against tyrosinase and α-glucosidase activities.
23640283	The design and realization of a large-area flexible nanofiber-based mat for pollutant degradation: an application in photocatalysis.	"This work demonstrates a novel multifunctional nanofibrous mat for photocatalytic applications based on TiO2 nanocables functionalized by Ag nanoparticles and coated with a thin (∼2 nm) graphitic shell. In this mat, which was realized by an electrospinning technique, each component serves a unique function: the carbon coating acts as both an adsorption material for capturing pollutants and as a charge-transfer material, the Ag nanoparticles act as a visible-light sensitizing agent and also as a charge-transfer material, finally the TiO2 nanocable mat acts as a UV sensitive photocatalytic matrix and as the flexible substrate for the other functional components. This multicomponent nanocable mat exhibits excellent photocatalytic activity under simulated solar irradiation for the degradation of model pollutants including RhB and phenol. The significant photocatalytic properties are attributed to the synergetic effect of the three functional components and the unique charge transport ""freeway"" property of the nanofibrous mat. In addition, the porous carbon coating infiltrated into the nanocable matrix endows the mat with excellent flexibility and enables robust, large-area (10 × 10 cm) fabrication, representing a significant advantage over previous brittle ceramic nanofibrous mat photocatalyst substrates. This study provides new insight into the design and preparation of an advanced, yet commercially practical and scaleable photocatalytic composite membrane material. The as-prepared photocatalytic mat might also be of interest in solar cell, catalysis, separation technology, biomedical engineering, and nanotechnology."
9808678	Morphine-6beta-glucuronide-induced hyperphagia: characterization of opioid action by selective antagonists and antisense mapping in rats.	Opiate drugs such as morphine stimulate food intake in rats. The morphine metabolite, morphine-6beta-glucuronide (M6G), is more active than morphine in analgesic assays, and appears to act through distinct receptors. Thus, although morphine analgesia is decreased by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (AS ODNs) targeting exons 1 and 4 of the MOR-1 clone, M6G analgesia is reduced by probes targeting exons 2 and 3 of the MOR-1 clone. Our study examined whether central administration of M6G increased food intake in rats, and characterized this response using either selective mu, kappa1, delta1 and delta2 antagonists, or antisense directed against the various cloned opioid receptors. Central M6G (10-1000 ng) significantly and dose-dependently increased intake after 4 hr. Whereas mu antagonism with betaFNA significantly and dose-dependently reduced M6G-induced hyperphagia, equimolar doses of delta1, delta2, and kappa1 antagonists were ineffective. AS ODNs directed against either exons 2 or 3 of the MOR-1 clone blocked M6G-induced hyperphagia, whereas either AS ODNs directed against exons 1 or 4, or a MS ODN directed against exon 2 were ineffective. In contrast, an AS ODN probe directed against exon 1, but not exon 2, of the MOR-1 clone reduced morphine-induced hyperphagia, an effect identical to DAMGO-induced hyperphagia. Whereas M6G-induced hyperphagia was insensitive to antisense probes directed against the DOR-1, KOR-1 and KOR-3/ORL1 clones, these probes respectively reduced hyperphagia induced by deltorphin II, U50488H and nociceptin. Although pharmacological data indicate that M6G-induced hyperphagia acts through mu receptors, antisense data imply that the hyperphagic actions of M6G are mediated by a receptor distinct from traditional mu agonists, either as an alternative splice variant of the MOR-1 clone or a distinct gene.
10871202	Effects of troglitazone on blood concentrations of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 in patients with type 2 diabetes and in lean and obese normal subjects.	Low plasma fibrinolytic activity in association with increased plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) levels has been linked to an increased risk of atherosclerosis in obesity and type 2 diabetes. We tested the hypothesis that troglitazone, which improves insulin sensitivity and lowers plasma insulin levels in insulin-resistant obese subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes, would also lower circulating PAI-1 antigen concentrations and activity. We assessed insulin sensitivity (5-h, 80 mU x m(-2) x min(-1) hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp) and measured plasma PAI-1 antigen and activities and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in 14 patients with type 2 diabetes and 20 normal control subjects (10 lean, 10 obese) before and after 3 months of treatment with troglitazone (600 mg/day). At baseline, plasma PAI-1 antigen levels after an overnight fast were significantly higher in the obese (33.5 +/- 4.7 microg/l) and type 2 diabetic subjects (54.9 +/- 6.3 microg/l) than in the lean control subjects (16.3 +/- 3.2 microg/l; P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively). Troglitazone decreased plasma PAI-1 antigen concentrations in the diabetic patients (36.8 +/- 5.0 microg/l; P < 0.001 vs. baseline), but the reduction in the obese subjects did not reach statistical significance (baseline, 33.5 +/- 4.7; after troglitazone, 25.6 +/- 5.2 microg/l). Changes in plasma PAI-1 activity paralleled those of PAI-1 antigen. The extent of the reduction in plasma PAI-1 antigen concentrations in the diabetic patients after troglitazone correlated with the reductions in fasting plasma insulin (r = 0.60, P < 0.05), nonesterified fatty acid (r = 0.63, P < 0.02), and glucose concentrations (r = 0.64, P < 0.02) but not with the improvement in glucose disposal rates during the glucose clamps. Three nonresponders to troglitazone with respect to effects on insulin sensitivity and fasting glucose and insulin levels also had no reduction in circulating PAI-1. In conclusion, troglitazone enhances fibrinolytic system activity in insulin-resistant type 2 diabetic patients. This effect appears to be intimately linked to its potential to lower plasma insulin levels and improve glycemic control through its peripheral tissue insulin-sensitizing effects.
23462104	Effects of seaweed-restructured pork diets enriched or not with cholesterol on rat cholesterolaemia and liver damage.	Seaweed enriched-restructured pork (RP) is a potential functional food. However, indications of adverse effects associated with herbal medications, which include among others liver failure, toxic hepatitis, and death have been reported. Cholesterol feeding produces hepatomegalia and fat liver infiltration. The effect of seaweed-RP diet, cholesterol-enriched or not, on plasma cholesterol, liver damage markers, structure, and cytochrome CYP4A-1 were evaluated after 5wk. Eight rat groups were fed a mix of 85% AIN-93M rodent-diet plus 15% RP. The Cholesterol-control (CC), Cholesterol-Wakame (CW), Cholesterol-Nori (CN) and Cholesterol-Sea Spaghetti (CS) groups respectively consumed similar diets to control (C), Wakame (W), Nori (N), and Sea Spaghetti (S) but as part of hypercholesterolaemic diets. CN and CS significantly blocked the hypercholesterolaemic effect observed in CC group. After 5-wk, N and S diets increased the CYP4A-1 expression. However, seaweed-RPs were unable to reduce the histological liver alterations observed in CC group. Larger and more abundant hepatocellular alterations were found in CS and CN rats suggesting that the hypocholesterolaemic effects of these seaweed-RPs seem to be a two-edged sword as they increased liver damage. Future studies are needed to understand the involved mechanisms.
23532918	Synthesis and in Vitro Characterisation of Ifenprodil-Based Fluorescein Conjugates as GluN1/GluN2B N-Methyl-D-aspartate Receptor Antagonists.	GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors are involved in many important physiological functions and play a pivotal role in mediating pain as well as in several neurodegenerative disorders. We aimed to develop fluorescent probes to target the GluN2B subunit selectively in order to allow better understanding of the relationships between receptor localisation and physiological importance. Ifenprodil, known as the GluNR2B antagonist of reference, was chosen as the template for the elaboration of probes. We had previously reported a fluorescein conjugate that was shown (by confocal microscopy imaging of DS-red-labelled cortical neurons) to bind specifically to GluN2B. To elaborate this probe, we explored the influence of both the nature and the attachment point of the spacer between the fluorophore and the parent compound, ifenprodil. We performed chemical modifications of ifenprodil at the benzylic position and on the phenol ring by introducing secondary amine or amide functions and evaluated alkyl chains from two to 20 bonds either including or not including secondary amide functions as spacers. The previously developed probe was found to display the greatest activity in the inhibition of NMDA-induced Ca(2+) influx by calcium imaging experiments on HEK293 cells transfected with the cDNA encoding for GluN1-1A and GluN2B. Further investigations revealed that this probe had a neuroprotective effect equivalent to that of ifenprodil in a standard test for neurotoxicity. Despite effects of lesser amplitude with these probes relative to ifenprodil, we demonstrated that they displaced [(3) H]ifenprodil in mouse brain slices in a similar manner.
22899102	Multidrug resistance-associated proteins are involved in the transport of the glutathione conjugates of the ultimate carcinogen of benzo[a]pyrene in human Caco-2 cells.	A wide variety of contaminants are ingested through food, among them the pro-carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon benzo[a]pyrene (BP) that is resorbed and partially metabolized in the enterocytes of the small intestine. Previous in vitro studies have revealed that BP phenols are excreted as Phase II metabolites including glucuronides and sulfates. This export is mediated by the breast cancer resistance protein (ABCG2). The ultimate carcinogenic Phase I BP metabolite anti-BP-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide (BPDE) can be detoxified by glutathione conjugate formation catalyzed by glutathione S-transferases. In the present study, differentiated human intestinal Caco-2 cells were used as a model for the human small intestine to investigate the detoxification of BPDE and excretion of stereoisomeric glutathione conjugates in the presence of an inhibitor of the glutathione-cleaving enzyme γ-glutamyl transpeptidase at the cell surface. The results indicate that the glutathione conjugates of BPDE are formed and excreted mainly to the apical and to a minor extent to the basolateral side of polarized Caco-2 monolayers. Inhibition studies revealed that the multidrug resistance-associated proteins (ABCCs) are involved in the transport of BPDE glutathione conjugates. Stable ABCC1, ABCC2 and ABCC3 knockdown cell lines were generated, thus making it possible to demonstrate that ABCC1 mediates the basolateral and ABCC2 the apical excretion of BPDE glutathione conjugates. In conclusion, the ultimate carcinogen BPDE is detoxified via glutathione conjugation and subsequently excreted by Caco-2 cells in both apical and basolateral directions. This finding is equivalent to a transport into feces as well as blood system in the in vivo situation.
23454527	Effect of serum on diesel exhaust particles (DEP)-induced apoptosis of airway epithelial cells in vitro.	Patients with chronic airway diseases may be more susceptible to adverse effects of air pollutants including diesel exhaust particles (DEP). We investigated effects of foetal calf serum (FCS) on DEP-induced changes in airway epithelial cell apoptosis and inflammation. DEP (50-200 μg/ml) increased A549 cell viability in the absence of FCS. In the presence of 3.3%FCS, DEP (50-400 μg/ml) decreased A549 cell viability. N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 33 mM) and the c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor (SP600125, 33 μM) further decreased the viability in the presence of DEP (200 μg/ml) and 3.3% FCS. Under serum-free (SF) condition, DEP (50 μg/ml) reduced apoptotic cells; however, when 3.3% FCS added to the culture medium, this effect was abolished. DEP (200 μg/ml) induced mRNA expression of p21(CIP1/WAF1) both in absence or presence of 3.3% FCS and enhanced JNK2 mRNA expression only in the presence of 3.3% FCS. Under SF condition, DEP (50 μg/ml) induced mRNA expression for p27 and p53, whereas cyclin E mRNA expression was inhibited by DEP (50 and 200 μg/ml). Furthermore, DEP (200 μg/ml) decreased the release of interleukin (IL)-8 in the absence of FCS. In conclusion, FCS modulates effects of DEP on cell death, cell cycle and apoptosis regulating proteins, and IL-8 release by activating oxidant stress pathways, JNK and NF-κB. Extravasation of serum, as occurs in the inflamed airways of patients with chronic airway diseases such as asthma and COPD, may render airway epithelial cells more susceptible to the deleterious effects of DEP.
9610840	Dietary alpha-linolenic acid increases TNF-alpha, and decreases IL-6, IL-10 in response to LPS: effects of sesamin on the delta-5 desaturation of omega6 and omega3 fatty acids in mice.	Sesamin (a non-fat portion of sesame seed oil) inhibits delta-5 desaturase activity resulting in an accumulation of dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) which can displace arachidonic acid (AA) and decrease the formation of pro-inflammatory mediators. We investigated the effects of consumption of diets containing 0.25wt% sesamin and 15 wt% safflower oil (SO) (providing 12% of the added fat as linoleic acid) or a 15 wt% 2:1 mixture of linseed oil and SO (LOSO) (providing 6% alpha-linolenic acid and 6% linoleic acid) for 3 weeks on the liver membrane fatty acid composition and on the production of prostaglandin (PG) E2, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL10 in mice. Consumption of sesamin-supplemented SO and LOSO diets resulted in a significant increase in the levels of 20:3omega6 (DGLA), suggesting that sesamin inhibited delta-5 desaturation of omega6 fatty acids. In animals fed LOSO diets, the levels of alpha-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were elevated with a concomitant decrease of arachidonic acid (AA) in the liver membrane phospholipids. Further, in animals fed LOSO diets with or without sesamin, an increase in the circulating levels of TNF-alpha was associated with a concomitant decrease in PGE2. Despite a lack of differences in the levels of AA, the PGE2 levels were significantly lower in mice fed sesamin-supplemented SO compared to those fed SO alone. Thus, these data suggest that irrespective of the availability of a specific fatty acid as a substrate, through regulating the PGE2 synthesis, the production of TNF-alpha could be modulated.
17035141	Neural tube defects and folate pathway genes: family-based association tests of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions.	BACKGROUND: Folate metabolism pathway genes have been examined for association with neural tube defects (NTDs) because folic acid supplementation reduces the risk of this debilitating birth defect. Most studies addressed these genes individually, often with different populations providing conflicting results. OBJECTIVES: Our study evaluates several folate pathway genes for association with human NTDs, incorporating an environmental cofactor: maternal folate supplementation. METHODS: In 304 Caucasian American NTD families with myelomeningocele or anencephaly, we examined 28 polymorphisms in 11 genes: folate receptor 1, folate receptor 2, solute carrier family 19 member 1, transcobalamin II, methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1, serine hydroxymethyl-transferase 1, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homo-cysteine methyltransferase, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase reductase, betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT), and cystathionine-beta-synthase. RESULTS: Only single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in BHMT were significantly associated in the overall data set; this significance was strongest when mothers took folate-containing nutritional supplements before conception. The BHMT SNP rs3733890 was more significant when the data were stratified by preferential transmission of the MTHFR rs1801133 thermolabile T allele from parent to offspring. Other SNPs in folate pathway genes were marginally significant in some analyses when stratified by maternal supplementation, MTHFR, or BHMT allele transmission. CONCLUSIONS: BHMT rs3733890 is significantly associated in our data set, whereas MTHFR rs1801133 is not a major risk factor. Further investigation of folate and methionine cycle genes will require extensive SNP genotyping and/or resequencing to identify novel variants, inclusion of environmental factors, and investigation of gene-gene interactions in large data sets.
23410161	Rationally designed multi-targeted agents against neurodegenerative diseases.	"Neurodegenerative diseases are complex disorders with several pathoetiological pathways leading to cell death. Rationally designed multi-targeted agents, or ""multi-targeted designed drugs"" (MTDD) show significant promise in preclinical studies as neuroprotective and disease-modifying agents. In this review, we highlight the use of chemical scaffolds that lend themselves exquisitely to the development of MTDDs in neurodegeneration. Notably, synthetic polycyclic cage compounds have served as scaffolds for novel voltage-gated calcium channel blockers, NMDA receptor antagonists, and sigma-receptor ligands - attractive targets in neurodegeneration. In an entirely different approach, compounds containing the thiazolidinedione moiety (referred to as glitazones) alter mitochondrial function through the mitochondrial protein mitoNEET, an attractive new drug target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. The design strategy for yet another agent, ladostigil, employed the amalgamation of active chemical moieties of the AChE inhibitor rivastigmine, and the monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitor rasagiline, leading to a single compound that targets both enzymes simultaneously. Natural products have also served as design templates for several MTDD design studies. In particular, the stilbene scaffold has become popular in particular due to the neuroprotective effects of the non-flavonoid natural product resveratrol. Recently, stilbene scaffold-based compounds were developed to reduce - through chelation with metal ions that interact with beta-amyloid - both metal-induced beta-amyloid protein aggregation, and ROS generated from this aggregate. Other subtle modifications of the stilbene motif led to the creation of reversible, non-competitive MAO inhibitors. Finally, compounds derived from the xanthine scaffold afford neuroprotection in Parkinson's disease through mechanisms that include dual adenosine A2A receptor antagonism and MAO-B inhibition."
23238783	The influence of sex, ethnicity, and CYP2B6 genotype on bupropion metabolism as an index of hepatic CYP2B6 activity in humans.	The effects of sex, ethnicity, and genetic polymorphism on hepatic CYP2B6 (cytochrome P450 2B6) expression and activity were previously demonstrated in vitro. Race/ethnic differences in CYP2B6 genotype and phenotype were observed only in women. To identify important covariates associated with interindividual variation in CYP2B6 activity in vivo, we evaluated these effects in healthy volunteers using bupropion (Wellbutrin SR GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC) as a CYP2B6 probe substrate. A fixed 150-mg oral sustained-release dose of bupropion was administered to 100 healthy volunteers comprising four sex/ethnicity cohorts (n = 25 each): Caucasian men and Caucasian, African American, and Hispanic women. Blood samples were obtained at 0 and 6 hours postdose for the measurement of serum bupropion (BU) and hydroxybupropion (HB) concentrations. Whole blood was obtained at baseline for CYP2B6 genotyping. To characterize the relationship between CYP2B6 activity and ethnicity, sex, and genotype when accounting for serum BU concentrations (dose-adjusted log(10)-transformed), analysis of covariance model was fitted in which the dependent variable was CYP2B6 activity represented as the log(10)-transformed, metabolic ratio of HB to BU concentrations. Several CYP2B6 polymorphisms were associated with CYP2B6 activity. Evidence of dependence of CYP2B6 activity on ethnicity or genotype-by-ethnicity interactions was not detected in women. These results suggest that CYP2B6 genotype is the most important patient variable for predicting the level of CYP2B6 activity in women, when measured by the metabolism of bupropion. The bupropion metabolic ratio appears to detect known differences in CYP2B6 activity associated with genetic polymorphism, across different ethnic groups. Prospective studies will be needed to validate the use of bupropion as a probe substrate for clinical use.
23620529	High salt diets during pregnancy affected fetal and offspring renal renin-angiotensin system.	Intrauterine environments are linked to fetal renal development and postnatal health. Influence of salt diets during pregnancy on renal functions and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) were determined in the ovine fetus and offspring. Pregnant ewes were fed high-salt diet (HSD) or normal-salt diet (NSD) for two months during middle-later gestation. Fetal renal functions, plasma hormones, mRNA and protein expressions of the key elements of renal RAS were measured in the fetus and offspring. Fetal renal excretion of sodium was increased while urine volume decreased in HSD group. Fetal blood urea nitrogen was increased, while kidney/body weight ratio decreased in HSD group. The altered ratio also was observed in the offspring at 15-day-old and 90-day-old. Maternal and fetal plasma antidiuretic hormone was elevated without change in plasma renin activity and Ang I levels, while plasma Ang II was decreased. The key elements of local renal RAS, including angiotensinogen, ACE, ACE2, AT1 and AT2 receptor expression in both mRNA and protein, except renin, were altered following maternal high salt intake. The results suggest that High intake of salt during pregnancy affected fetal renal development associated with an altered expression of the renal key elements of RAS, some alterations of fetal origins remained after birth as possible risks in developing renal or cardiovascular diseases.
22956632	Toxicity profile of small-molecule IAP antagonist GDC-0152 is linked to TNF-α pharmacology.	Inhibitor-of-apoptosis (IAP) proteins suppress apoptosis and are overexpressed in a variety of cancers. Small-molecule IAP antagonists are currently being tested in clinical trials as novel cancer therapeutics. GDC-0152 is a small-molecule drug that triggers tumor cell apoptosis by selectively antagonizing IAPs. GDC-0152 induces NF-κB transcriptional activity leading to expression of several chemokines and cytokines, of which tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) is the most important for single-agent tumor activity. TNF-α is a pleiotropic cytokine that drives a variety of cellular responses, comprising inflammation, proliferation, and cell survival or death depending on the cellular context. As malignant and normal cells produce TNF-α upon IAP antagonism, increased TNF-α could drive both efficacy and toxicity. The toxicity profile of GDC-0152 in dogs and rats was characterized after iv dose administration once every 2 weeks for four doses. Findings in both species consisted of a dose-related, acute, systemic inflammatory response, and hepatic injury. Laboratory findings included elevated plasma cytokines, an inflammatory leukogram, and increased liver transaminases with histopathological findings of inflammatory infiltrates and apoptosis/necrosis in multiple tissues; a toxicology profile consistent with TNF-α-mediated toxicity. Dogs exhibited more severe findings than rats, and humans did not exhibit these findings, at comparable exposures across species. Furthermore, elevations in blood neutrophil count, serum monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and other markers of inflammation corresponded to GDC-0152 exposure and toxicity and thus may have utility as safety biomarkers.
23454297	Caffeic acid treatment alters the extracellular adenine nucleotide hydrolysis in platelets and lymphocytes of adult rats.	This study evaluated the effects of caffeic acid on ectonucleotidase activities such as NTPDase (nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase), Ecto-NPP (nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase), 5'-nucleotidase and adenosine deaminase (ADA) in platelets and lymphocytes of rats, as well as in the profile of platelet aggregation. Animals were divided into five groups: I (control); II (oil); III (caffeic acid 10mg/kg); IV (caffeic acid 50mg/kg); and V (caffeic acid 100mg/kg). Animals were treated with caffeic acid diluted in oil for 30days. In platelets, caffeic acid decreased the ATP hydrolysis and increased ADP hydrolysis in groups III, IV and V when compared to control (P<0.05). The 5'-nucleotidase activity was decreased, while E-NPP and ADA activities were increased in platelets of rats of groups III, IV and V (P<0.05). Caffeic acid reduced significantly the platelet aggregation in the animals of groups III, IV and V in relation to group I (P<0.05). In lymphocytes, the NTPDase and ADA activities were increased in all groups treated with caffeic acid when compared to control (P<0.05). These findings demonstrated that the enzymes were altered in tissues by caffeic acid and this compound decreased the platelet aggregation suggesting that caffeic acid should be considered a potentially therapeutic agent in disorders related to the purinergic system.
23142425	4-(Methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) metabolism-related enzymes gene polymorphisms, NNK metabolites levels and urothelial carcinoma.	Gene polymorphisms of the 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) metabolism-related enzymes-cytochrome P450 (CYP) monooxygenase 2A13 (CYP2A13) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT)-2B7 could contribute to the levels of NNK-related metabolites in urine, thereby increasing the susceptibility to urothelial carcinoma (UC). Therefore, our study aimed to evaluate the roles of two gene polymorphisms (CYP2A13 and UGT2B7) of NNK metabolism-related enzymes in the carcinogenesis of UC in Taiwan. A hospital-based pilot case-control study was conducted. There were 121 UC cases and 121 age- and sex-matched healthy participants recruited from March 2007 to April 2009. Urine samples were analyzed for NNK-related metabolites using the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. Genotyping was conducted using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. ANCOVA and multivariate logistic regression were applied for data analyses. In healthy controls, former smokers had significantly higher total NNAL and higher NNAL-Gluc than never smokers or current smokers. Subjects carrying the UGT2B7 268 His/Tyr or Tyr/Tyr genotype had significantly lower total NNAL than those carrying His/His genotype. However, no association was seen between gene polymorphisms of CYP2A13 and UGT2B7 and UC risk after adjustment for age and sex. Significant dose -response associations between total NNAL, free NNAL, the ratios of free NNAL/total NNAL and NNAL-Gluc/total NNAL and UC risk were observed. In the future, large-scale studies will be required to verify the association between the single nucleotide polymorphisms of NNK metabolism-related enzymes and UC risk.
23346856	Controlled synthesis of amino acid-based pH-responsive chiral polymers and self-assembly of their block copolymers.	Leucine/isoleucine side chain polymers are of interest due to their hydrophobicity and reported role in the formation of α-helical structures. The synthesis and reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization of amino acid-based chiral monomers, namely Boc-L-leucine methacryloyloxyethyl ester (Boc-L-Leu-HEMA, 1a), Boc-L-leucine acryloyloxyethyl ester (Boc-L-Leu-HEA, 1b), Boc-L-isoleucine methacryloyloxyethyl ester (Boc-L-Ile-HEMA, 1c), and Boc-L-isoleucine acryloyloxyethyl ester (Boc-L-Ile-HEA, 1d), are reported. The controlled nature of the polymerization of the said chiral monomers in N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) at 70 °C is evident from the formation of narrow polydisperse polymers, the molecular weight controlled by the monomer/chain transfer agent (CTA) molar ratio and the linear relationship between molecular weight and monomer conversion. The resulting well-defined polymers were used as macro-CTAs to prepare corresponding diblock copolymers by RAFT polymerization of methyl (meth)acrylate monomers. Deprotection of Boc groups in the homopolymers and block copolymers under acidic conditions produced cationic, pH-responsive polymers with primary amine moieties at the side chains. The optical activity of the homopolymers and block copolymers were studied using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and specific rotation measurements. The self-assembling nature of the block copolymers to produce highly ordered structures was illustrated through dynamic light scattering (DLS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies. The side chain amine functionality instills pH-responsive behavior, which makes these cationic polymers attractive candidates for drug delivery applications, as well as for conjugation of biomolecules.
17635930	Potent inhibition of HIV-1 replication by novel non-peptidyl small molecule inhibitors of protease dimerization.	Dimerization of HIV-1 protease subunits is essential for its proteolytic activity, which plays a critical role in HIV-1 replication. Hence, the inhibition of protease dimerization represents a unique target for potential intervention of HIV-1. We developed an intermolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based HIV-1-expression assay employing cyan and yellow fluorescent protein-tagged protease monomers. Using this assay, we identified non-peptidyl small molecule inhibitors of protease dimerization. These inhibitors, including darunavir and two experimental protease inhibitors, blocked protease dimerization at concentrations of as low as 0.01 microm and blocked HIV-1 replication with IC(50) values of 0.0002-0.48 microm. These agents also inhibited the proteolytic activity of mature protease. Other approved anti-HIV-1 agents examined except tipranavir, a CCR5 inhibitor, and soluble CD4 failed to block the dimerization event. Once protease monomers dimerize to become mature protease, mature protease is not dissociated by this dimerization inhibition mechanism, suggesting that these agents block dimerization at the nascent stage of protease maturation. The proteolytic activity of mature protease that managed to undergo dimerization despite the presence of these agents is likely to be inhibited by the same agents acting as conventional protease inhibitors. Such a dual inhibition mechanism should lead to highly potent inhibition of HIV-1.
23436129	Impact of acamprosate on behavior and brain-derived neurotrophic factor: an open-label study in youth with fragile X syndrome.	"RATIONALE: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an inherited form of developmental disability and a single gene cause of autism. As a disorder with increasingly understood pathophysiology, FXS is a model form of developmental disability for targeted drug development efforts. Preclinical animal model findings have focused targeted drug treatment development in FXS on an imbalance between excessive glutamate and deficient gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission. METHODS: We conducted a prospective open-label 10-week trial of acamprosate in 12 youth aged 6-17 years (mean age: 11.9 years) with FXS. RESULTS: Acamprosate use (mean dose: 1,054 ± 422 mg/day) was associated with treatment response (defined by a Clinical Global Impressions Improvement (CGI-I) scale score of ""very much improved"" or ""much improved"") in nine of 12 (75 %) subjects. Improvement was noted in social behavior and inattention/hyperactivity using multiple standard behavioral outcome measures. No significant adverse effects or changes in vital signs, including weight or laboratory measures, occurred during treatment with acamprosate. Additionally, pre- and post-treatment blood biomarker analyses looking at brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels found a significant increase in BDNF with treatment. In our pilot sample, treatment response did not correlate with change in BDNF with treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Acamprosate was generally safe and well tolerated and was associated with a significant improvement in social behavior and a reduction in inattention/hyperactivity. The increase in BDNF that occurred with treatment may be a useful pharmacodynamic marker in future acamprosate studies. Given these findings, a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of acamprosate in youth with FXS is warranted."
19780818	The potassium channel subunit Kvbeta3 interacts with pannexin 1 and attenuates its sensitivity to changes in redox potentials.	Pannexin 1 (Panx1), a member of the second gap junction protein family identified in vertebrates, appears to preferentially form non-junctional membrane channels. A candidate regulatory protein of Panx1 is the potassium channel subunit Kvbeta3, previously identified by bacterial two-hybrid strategies. Here, we report on the physical association of Panx1 with Kvbeta3 by immunoprecipitation when co-expressed in a neuroblastoma cell line (Neuro2A). Furthermore, in vivo co-expression of Panx1 and Kvbeta3 was shown to occur in murine hippocampus and cerebellum. Kvbeta3 is known to accelerate inactivation of otherwise slowly inactivating potassium channels under reducing conditions. We subsequently found that Panx1 channel currents exhibit a significant reduction when exposed to reducing agents, and that this effect is attenuated in the presence of Kvbeta3. Apparently, Kvbeta3 is involved in regulating the susceptibility of Panx1 channels to redox potential. Furthermore, the Panx1 channel blockers carbenoxolone and Probenecid were less effective in inhibiting Panx1 currents when Kvbeta3 was co-expressed. The influence of Kvbeta3 on Panx1 is the first example of modulation of Panx1 channel function(s) by interacting proteins, and suggests the physiological importance of sensing changes in redox potentials.
23357565	Protective effect of silymarin against ethanol-induced gastritis in rats: role of sulfhydryls, nitric oxide and gastric sensory afferents.	Silymarin has been known to exert antioxidant, anti-carcinogenic and anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, we examined the effect of silymarin on gastritis in rats. Oral administration of silymarin dose-dependently decreased gastric lesions in ethanol-induced gastritis model. Silymarin also significantly suppressed the development of gastric lesions in aspirin- or water immersion-restraint stress-induced gastritis models. Further study demonstrated that the gastroprotective effect of silymarin was blocked by nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor l-NAME, SH blocker N-ethylmaleimide or TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine in ethanol-induced gastritis model. In addition, ex vivo analysis revealed that ethanol-induced decrease in gastric mucus and non-protein sulfhydryl (NPSH) groups was significantly reversed by silymarin treatment and lipid peroxidation was also suppressed by silymarin in ethanol-induced gastritis model. Taken together, these results suggest that silymarin exerts gastroprotective effects and the gastroprotective effects of silymarin might be related to the protection of gastric mucosal NO and NP-SH and the modulation of capsaicin-sensitive gastric sensory afferents.
17494951	IL-4 stimulates the expression of CXCL-8, E-selectin, VEGF, and inducible nitric oxide synthase mRNA by equine pulmonary artery endothelial cells.	Little is known concerning the possible contribution of T helper 2 (Th2)-type cytokines to the recruitment of neutrophils into the lung tissue. In the present study, endothelial cells from equine pulmonary arteries were cultured in the presence of recombinant equine (re) IL-4 and reIL-5, and the cytokine mRNA expression of molecules implicated in the chemotaxis and migration of neutrophils was studied using real-time RT-PCR. The functional response of reIL-4-induced endothelial cell stimulation on neutrophil migration was also studied using a chemotaxis chamber. ReIL-4 either increased the expression of CXCL-8, E-selectin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), or potentiated the coeffects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) on CXCL-8. Supernatants collected from cultured endothelial cells stimulated with reIL-4 significantly promoted neutrophil migration in a dose-dependent manner. Dexamethasone (DXM) decreased the expression of CXCL-8, VEGF, and iNOS induced by reIL-4, while 1400W dihydrochloride (1400W), a selective inhibitor of iNOS, decreased the expression of E-selectin, VEGF, and iNOS. DXM and 1400W attenuated the mRNA expression of E-selectin and iNOS induced by the costimulation of reIL-4, reTNF-alpha, and LPS. Neither equine nor human recombinant IL-5 influenced the mRNA expression of CXCL-8, E-selectin, or VEGF. These findings suggest that Th2-type cytokines may contribute to pulmonary neutrophilia during allergic inflammation by the increased expression of neutrophil chemokines and adhesion molecules by endothelial cells. DXM and the iNOS inhibitors may decrease pulmonary neutrophilia due, in part, to a direct inhibition of some of these factors.
23284002	Trichostatin A inhibits transforming growth factor-β-induced reactive oxygen species accumulation and myofibroblast differentiation via enhanced NF-E2-related factor 2-antioxidant response element signaling.	Trichostatin A (TSA) has been shown to prevent fibrosis in vitro and in vivo. The present study aimed at investigating the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging by TSA on transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-induced myofibroblast differentiation of corneal fibroblasts in vitro. Human immortalized corneal fibroblasts were treated with TGF-β in the presence of TSA, the NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), the NF-E2-related factor 2-antioxidant response element (Nrf2-ARE) activator sulforaphane, or small interfering RNA. Myofibroblast differentiation was assessed by α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression, F-actin bundle formation, and collagen gel contraction. ROS, H(2)O(2), intracellular glutathione (GSH) level, cellular total antioxidant capacity, and the activation of Nrf2-ARE signaling were determined with various assays. Treatment with TSA and the Nrf2-ARE activator resulted in increased inhibition of the TGF-β-induced myofibroblast differentiation as compared with treatment with DPI or NAC. Furthermore, TSA also decreased cellular ROS and H(2)O(2) accumulation induced by TGF-β, whereas it elevated intracellular GSH level and cellular total antioxidant capacity. In addition, TSA induced Nrf2 nuclear translocation and up-regulated the expression of Nrf2-ARE downstream antioxidant genes, whereas Nrf2 knockdown by RNA interference blocked the inhibition of TSA on myofibroblast differentiation. In conclusion, this study provides the first evidence implicating that TSA inhibits TGF-β-induced ROS accumulation and myofibroblast differentiation via enhanced Nrf2-ARE signaling.
23161664	Hypoxia-response element (HRE)-directed transcriptional regulation of the rat lysyl oxidase gene in response to cobalt and cadmium.	Lysyl oxidase (LO) catalyzes crosslink of collagen, elastin, and histone H1, stabilizing the extracellular matrix and cell nucleus. This enzyme displays dual functions for tumorigenesis, i.e., as a tumor suppressor inactivating the ras oncogene and as a tumor promoter enhancing malignant cell metastasis. To elucidate LO transcriptional regulation, we have cloned the 804 base pair region upstream of the translation start site (ATG) of the rat LO gene with the maximal promoter activity. Computer analysis indicated that at least four hypoxia-response element (HRE) consensuses (5'-ACGTG-3') exist in the cloned LO promoter. Treatment of rat lung fibroblasts (RFL6) with CoCl2 (Co, 10-100 μM), a chemical hypoxia reagent, enhanced LO mRNA expression and promoter activities. Overexpression of LO was associated with upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α at mRNA levels in cobalt (Co)-treated cells. Thus, LO is a hypoxia-responsive gene. Dominant negative-HIF-1α inhibited LO promoter activities stimulated by Co. Electrophoretic mobility shift, oligonucleotide competition, and in vitro translated HIF-1α binding assays indicated that only one HRE mapped at -387/-383 relative to ATG was functionally active among four consensuses. Site-directed mutation of this HRE significantly diminished the Co-induced and LO promoter-directed expression of the reporter gene. Cadmium (Cd), an inducer of reactive oxygen species, inhibited HIF-1α mRNA expression and HIF-1α binding to the LO gene in Co-treated cells as revealed by RT-PCR and ChIP assays, respectively. Thus, modulation of the HRE activity by Co and Cd plays a critical role in LO gene transactivation.
23050902	Ribavirin-induced intracellular GTP depletion activates transcription elongation in coagulation factor VII gene expression.	Coagulation FVII (Factor VII) is a vitamin K-dependent glycoprotein synthesized in hepatocytes. It was reported previously that FVII gene (F7) expression was up-regulated by ribavirin treatment in hepatitis C virus-infected haemophilia patients; however, its precise mechanism is still unknown. In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of ribavirin-induced up-regulation of F7 expression in HepG2 (human hepatoma cell line). We found that intracellular GTP depletion by ribavirin as well as other IMPDH (inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase) inhibitors, such as mycophenolic acid and 6-mercaptopurine, up-regulated F7 expression. FVII mRNA transcription was mainly enhanced by accelerated transcription elongation, which was mediated by the P-TEFb (positive-transcription elongation factor b) complex, rather than by promoter activation. Ribavirin unregulated ELL (eleven-nineteen lysine-rich leukaemia) 3 mRNA expression before F7 up-regulation. We observed that ribavirin enhanced ELL3 recruitment to F7, whereas knockdown of ELL3 diminished ribavirin-induced FVII mRNA up-regulation. Ribavirin also enhanced recruitment of CDK9 (cyclin-dependent kinase 9) and AFF4 to F7. These data suggest that ribavirin-induced intracellular GTP depletion recruits a super elongation complex containing P-TEFb, AFF4 and ELL3, to F7, and modulates FVII mRNA transcription elongation. Collectively, we have elucidated a basal mechanism for ribavirin-induced FVII mRNA up-regulation by acceleration of transcription elongation, which may be crucial in understanding its pleiotropic functions in vivo.
23424204	Effect of bisphenol-A on insulin signal transduction and glucose oxidation in skeletal muscle of adult male albino rat.	The estrogenic monomer bisphenol-A (BPA) is an endocrine-disrupting chemical used in the production of epoxy resins, plastic food and beverage containers, leading to ubiquitous human exposure. Environmentally relevant doses of BPA have profound effects on mice endocrine pancreas. It increases pancreatic insulin content and favors postprandial hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance in male mice. Skeletal muscle plays a crucial role in maintaining systemic glucose metabolism. In the present study, we investigated the possible effects of BPA on insulin-signaling molecules and glucose oxidation in skeletal muscle of male rat. Adult male Wistar albino rats were divided into three groups. Group I: control (vehicle treated) and groups II and III were administered with BPA orally (20 and 200 mg/kg bw/day, respectively). Although there was no change in the levels of insulin receptor (IR), Akt (protein kinase B) and glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4) messenger RNA, BPA significantly decreased the IR, Akt and GLUT4 protein levels (both plasma membrane and cytosolic fraction) of the gastrocnemius muscle. There was an increase in serum insulin and decrease in serum testosterone levels but fasting blood glucose level remained unaltered. In conclusion, BPA has adverse effects on phosphorylation of Akt, GLUT4 translocation and (14)C-glucose oxidation.
11319222	Expression and characterization of recombinant rat Acyl-CoA synthetases 1, 4, and 5. Selective inhibition by triacsin C and thiazolidinediones.	Inhibition by triacsins and troglitazone of long chain fatty acid incorporation into cellular lipids suggests the existence of inhibitor-sensitive and -resistant acyl-CoA synthetases (ACS, EC ) that are linked to specific metabolic pathways. In order to test this hypothesis, we cloned and purified rat ACS1, ACS4, and ACS5, the isoforms present in liver and fat cells, expressed the isoforms as ACS-Flag fusion proteins in Escherichia coli, and purified them by Flag affinity chromatography. The Flag epitope at the C terminus did not alter the kinetic properties of the enzyme. Purified ACS1-, 4-, and 5-Flag isoforms differed in their apparent K(m) values for ATP, thermolability, pH optima, requirement for Triton X-100, and sensitivity to N-ethylmaleimide and phenylglyoxal. The ACS inhibitor triacsin C strongly inhibited ACS1 and ACS4, but not ACS5. The thiazolidinedione (TZD) insulin-sensitizing drugs and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) ligands, troglitazone, rosiglitazone, and pioglitazone, strongly and specifically inhibited only ACS4, with an IC(50) of less than 1.5 microm. Troglitazone exhibited a mixed type inhibition of ACS4. alpha-Tocopherol, whose ring structure forms the non-TZD portion of troglitazone, did not inhibit ACS4, indicating that the thiazolidine-2,4-dione moiety is the critical component for inhibition. A non-TZD PPARgamma ligand, GW1929, which is 7-fold more potent than rosiglitazone, inhibited ACS1 and ACS4 poorly with an IC(50) of greater than 50 microm, more than 100-fold higher than was required for rosiglitazone, thereby demonstrating the specificity of TZD inhibition. Further, the PPARalpha ligands, clofibrate and GW4647, and various xenobiotic carboxylic acids known to be incorporated into complex lipids had no effect on ACS1, -4, or -5. These results, together with previous data showing that triacsin C and troglitazone strongly inhibit triacylglycerol synthesis compared with other metabolic pathways, suggest that ACS1 and ACS4 catalyze the synthesis of acyl-CoAs used for triacylglycerol synthesis and that lack of inhibition of a metabolic pathway by triacsin C does not prove lack of acyl-CoA involvement. The results further suggest the possibility that the insulin-sensitizing effects of the thiazolidinedione drugs might be achieved, in part, through direct interaction with ACS4 in a PPARgamma-independent manner.
23439480	Ghrelin inhibits sodium metabisulfite induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in rat gastric mucosa.	This study aimed to investigate the effect of ghrelin administration on sulfite induced oxidative and apoptotic changes in rat gastric mucosa. Forty male albino Wistar rats were randomized into control (C), sodium metabisulfite (Na2S2O5) treated (S), ghrelin treated (G) and, Na2S2O5+ghrelin treated (SG) groups. Sodium metabisulfite (100mg/kg/day) was given by gastric gavage and, ghrelin (20μg/kg/day) was given intraperitoneally for 5weeks. Plasma-S-sulfonate level was increased in S and SG groups. Na2S2O5 administration significantly elevated total oxidant status (TOS) levels while depleting total antioxidant status (TAS) levels in gastric mucosa. Ghrelin significantly decreased gastric TOS levels in the SG group compared with the S group. Additionally, TAS levels were found to be higher in SG group in reference to S group. Na2S2O5 administration also markedly increased the number of apoptotic cells, cleaved caspase-3 and PAR expression (PARP activity indicator) and, decreased Ki67 expression (cell proliferation index) in gastric mucosal cells. Ghrelin treatment decreased the number apoptotic cells, cytochrome C release, PAR and, caspase-3 expressions while increasing Ki67 expression in gastric mucosa exposed to Na2S2O5. In conclusion, we suggest that ghrelin treatment might ameliorate ingested-Na2S2O5 induced gastric mucosal injury stemming from apoptosis and oxidative stress in rats.
16867246	Association of DRD2 polymorphisms and chlorpromazine-induced extrapyramidal syndrome in Chinese schizophrenic patients.	AIM: Extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS) is most commonly affected by typical antipsychotic drugs that have a high affinity with the D2 receptor. Recently, many research groups have reported on the positive relationship between the genetic variations in the DRD2 gene and the therapeutic response in schizophrenia patients as a result of the role of variations in the receptor in modulating receptor expression. In this study, we evaluate the role DRD2 plays in chlorpromazine-induced EPS in schizophrenic patients. METHODS: We identified seven SNP(single nucleotide polymorphism) (-141Cins>del, TaqIB, TaqID, Ser311Cys, rs6275, rs6277 and TaqIA) in the DRD2 gene in 146 schizophrenic inpatients (59 with EPS and 87 without EPS according to the Simpson-Angus Scale) treated with chlorpromazine after 8 weeks. The alleles of all loci were determined by PCR (polymerase chain reaction). RESULTS: Polymorphisms TaqID, Ser311Cys and rs6277 were not polymorphic in the population recruited in the present study. No statistical significance was found in the allele distribution of -141Cins>del, TaqIB, rs6275 and TaqIA or in the estimated haplotypes (constituted by TaqIB, rs6275 and TaqIA) in linkage disequilibrium between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Our results did not lend strong support to the view that the genetic variation of the DRD2 gene plays a major role in the individually variable adverse effect induced by chlorpromazine, at least in Chinese patients with schizophrenia. Our results confirmed a previous study on the relationship between DRD2 and EPS in Caucasians.
23422872	Balancing societal needs and regulatory certainty: the case study of peramivir in Japan.	Regulators must balance societal and medical requirements against the need for certainty about benefit and risk for new medicines. This is described in a case study of the expedited review and approval of peramivir, a novel neuraminidase inhibitor, in Japan in the context of the emergence of new strain of influenza in 2009. The case illustrates the importance of regulatory science and transparency in supporting such decision making.
23454144	Role of oxidative stress in chemical allergens induced skin cells activation.	Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is an important occupational and environmental disease caused by topical exposure to chemical allergens. It describes the adverse effects that may results when exposure to a chemical elicits a T cell-mediated inflammatory skin disease. The ability of contact sensitizers to induce the oxidative stress pathway in keratinocytes and dendritic cells has been confirmed by several authors. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can serve as essential second messengers mediating cellular responses resulting in immune cells activation. Oxidative stress may be the starter point, as it leads to the activation of transcription factors and signaling pathways, including NF-kB and p38 MAPK, which leads to the release of cytokines and chemokines. ROS are also involved in the activation of the NLRP3/NALP3 inflammasome, which is required to direct the proteolytic maturation of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18, which are all integral to the process of dendritic cells mobilization, migration and functional maturation. Moreover, emerging evidence correlates ROS to changes in the constitution of the extracellular microenvironment found to facilitate ACD. The purpose of this review is to provide both conceptual and technical frameworks on the role of oxidative stress in chemical allergy.
23265893	Heterobivalent dual-target probe for targeting GRP and Y1 receptors on tumor cells.	Receptor targeting ligands for imaging and/or therapy of cancer are limited by heterogeneity of receptor expression by tumor cells, both inter-patient and intra-patient. It is often more important for imaging agents to identify local and distant spread of disease than it is to identify a specific receptor presence. Two natural hormone peptide receptors, GRPR and Y1, are specifically interesting because expression of GRPR, Y1 or both is up-regulated in most breast cancers. We describe here the design and development of a new heterobivalent peptide ligand, truncated bombesin (t-BBN)/BVD15-DO3A, for dual-targeting of GRPR and Y1, and validation of its dual binding capability. Such a probe should be useful in imaging cells, tissues and tumors that are GRPR and/or Y1 positive and should target radioisotopes, for example, (68)Ga and/or (177)Lu, to more tumors cells than single GRPR or Y1 targeted probes. A GRP targeting ligand, J-G-Abz4-QWAVGHLM-NH(2) (J-G-Abz4-t-BBN), and an Y1 targeting ligand, INP-K[ε-J-(α-DO3A-ε-DGa)-K]-YRLRY-NH(2)([ε-J-(α-DO3A-ε-DGa)-K]-BVD-15), were synthesized and coupled to produce the heterobivalent ligand, t-BBN/BVD15-DO3A. Competitive displacement binding assays using t-BBN/BVD15-DO3A against (125)I-Tyr(4)-BBN yielded an IC(50) value of 18 ± 0.7 nM for GRPR in T-47D cells, a human breast cancer cell line. A similar assay using t-BBN/BVD15-DO3A against porcine (125)I-NPY showed IC(50) values of 80 ± 11 nM for Y1 receptor in MCF7 cells, another human breast cancer cell line. In conclusion, it is possible to construct a single DO3A chelate containing probe that can target both GRPR and Y1 on human tumor cells.
12564641	Effects of clozapine on the efflux of serotonin and dopamine in the rat brain: the role of 5-HT1A receptors.	In vivo microdialysis in conscious rats was used to examine the effect of clozapine on serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) efflux in the prefrontal cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus and dopamine efflux in the prefrontal cortex. Both systemic and local administration of clozapine (systemic, 10 or 20 mg/kg, i.p.; local, 100 microM) increased 5-HT efflux in the dorsal raphe. However, in the prefrontal cortex, dialysate 5-HT increased when clozapine (100 microM) was administered through the probe, while no effect was observed when it was administered systemically. By pretreatment with the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist p-MPPI (3 mg/kg, i.p.), systemic treatment of clozapine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly increased 5-HT efflux in the prefrontal cortex. This result suggests that the ability of clozapine to enhance the extracellular concentrations of 5-HT in the dorsal raphe attenuates this drug's effect in the frontal cortex, probably through the stimulation of 5-HT1A somatodendritic autoreceptors in the dorsal raphe. We also found that pretreatment with p-MPPI (3 mg/kg, i.p.) attenuated by 45% the rise in cortical dopamine levels induced by clozapine (10 mg/kg, i.p.). These findings imply that the reduction in serotonergic input from the dorsal raphe nucleus induced by clozapine could lead to an increase in dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex.
23605692	Using multiple targeted therapies in oncology: considerations for use, and progress to date in breast cancer.	There has been significant progress in our basic understanding of drugs and targets in the management of breast cancer. Recent breast cancer clinical trials have examined whether combinations of drugs targeting transmembrane receptors or their downstream effectors involved in cell signal transduction can increase response rates and overcome acquired and/or de novo drug resistance compared to a single targeted agent with or without systemic chemotherapy. We reviewed published clinical trials and conference proceedings examining combinations of targeted therapies across different breast cancer subtypes. Improvements in pathological complete response (pCR) rates and progression free survival (PFS) in preoperatively treated and metastatic human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer, respectively, have been observed with combinations of anti-HER2 therapies given concomitantly. Promising results were also observed in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer using a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor with tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor (AI) in the preoperative setting and for patients with metastatic breast cancer that had previously progressed on endocrine therapy alone. A recent phase II trial reported a statistically significant improvement in PFS with the addition of an oral inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 to letrozole compared to letrozole alone (26.1 versus 7.5 months). A phase III study is planned for early 2013. On the basis of preclinical data, clinical trials have examined combinations of hormonal agents such as fulvestrant with an AI. However, the results are conflicting. Early data indicated that poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors exploiting the concept of synthetic lethality would offer improved outcomes for patients with ER-negative, progesterone receptor (PR)-negative, HER2-negative breast cancer often referred to as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC); however, data in the phase III setting failed to confirm these findings but this may be because the drug was not a true PARP inhibitor. Chemotherapy continues to be the mainstay of treatment for TNBC until specific drugs and their associated targets are identified. As advances in medical technologies continue to identify multiple molecularly distinct breast cancer subgroups that are predicted to respond to combinations of targeted agents new challenges have arisen. In particular, how do we evaluate the safety and efficacy of these new drug combinations in relatively small subgroups of patients? Novel clinical trial designs will be required and increasingly regulatory agencies will require companion diagnostic tests that can identify the subgroups likely to respond to these therapies. The US Food and Drug Administration is assessing the role of pCR in breast cancer studies as a surrogate endpoint to predict clinical benefit in the accelerated drug approval process.
23193186	Hyperglycemia slows embryonic growth and suppresses cell cycle via cyclin D1 and p21.	In pregnant women, the diabetic condition results in a three- to fivefold increased risk for fetal cardiac malformations as a result of elevated glucose concentrations and the resultant osmotic stress in the developing embryo and fetus. Heart development before septation in the chick embryo was studied under two hyperglycemic conditions. Pulsed hyperglycemia induced by daily administration of glucose during 3 days of development caused daily spikes in plasma glucose concentration. In a second model, sustained hyperglycemia was induced with a single injection of glucose into the yolk on day 0. The sustained model raised the average plasma glucose concentration from 70 mg/dL to 180 mg/dL and led to decreased gene expression of glucose transporter GLUT1. Both models of hyperglycemia reduced embryo size, increased mortality, and delayed development. Within the heart outflow tract, reduced proliferation of myocardial and endocardial cells resulted from the sustained hyperglycemia and hyperosmolarity. The cell cycle inhibitor p21 was significantly increased, whereas cyclin D1, a cell cycle promoter, decreased in sustained hyperglycemia compared with controls. The evidence suggests that hyperglycemia-induced developmental delays are associated with slowed cell cycle progression, leading to reduced cellular proliferation. The suppression of critical developmental steps may underlie the cardiac defects observed during late gestation under hyperglycemic conditions.
23147375	Characteristic molecular signature for the early detection and prediction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in rat liver.	Predictions of toxicity are central for the assessment of chemical toxicity, and the effects of environmental toxic compounds are still a major issue for predicting potential human health risks. Among the various environmental toxicants, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are an important class of environmental pollutant, and many PAHs are known or suspected carcinogens. In the present study, to investigate whether characteristic expression profiles of PAHs exist in rat liver and whether a characteristic molecular signature can discriminate and predict among different PAHs at an early exposure time, we analyzed the genome-wide expression profiles of rat livers exposed to PAHs [benzo[a]anthracene (BA), benzo[a]pyrene (BP), phenanthrene (PA) and naphthalene (NT)]. At early time-point PAH exposure, large-scale gene expression analysis resulted in characteristic molecular signatures for each PAH, and supervised analysis identified 1183 outlier genes as a distinct molecular signature discerning PAHs from the normal control group. We identified 158 outlier genes as early predictive and surrogate markers for predicting each tested PAH by combination of two different multi-classification algorithms with 100% accuracy through a leave-one out cross-validation method. In conclusion, the characteristic gene expression signatures from a rat model system could be used as predictable and discernible gene-based biomarkers for the detection and prediction of PAHs, and these molecular markers may provide insights into the underlying mechanisms for genotoxicity of exposure to PAHs from environmental aspect.
15224175	5-HT1B receptors, alpha2A/2C- and, to a lesser extent, alpha1-adrenoceptors mediate the external carotid vasoconstriction to ergotamine in vagosympathectomised dogs.	It has previously been suggested that ergotamine produces external carotid vasoconstriction in vagosympathectomised dogs via 5-HT1B/1D receptors and alpha2-adrenoceptors. The present study has reanalysed this suggestion by using more selective antagonists alone and in combination. Fifty-two anaesthetised dogs were prepared for ultrasonic measurements of external carotid blood flow. The animals were divided into thirteen groups (n=4 each) receiving an i.v. bolus injection of, either physiological saline (0.3 ml/kg; control), or the antagonists SB224289 (300 microg/kg; 5-HT1B), BRL15572 (300 microg/kg; 5-HT1D), rauwolscine (300 microg/kg; alpha2), SB224289 + BRL15572 (300 microg/kg each), SB224289 + rauwolscine (300 microg/kg each), BRL15572 + rauwolscine (300 microg/kg each), rauwolscine (300 microg/kg) + prazosin (100 microg/kg; alpha1), SB224289 (300 microg/kg) + prazosin (100 microg/kg), SB224289 (300 microg/kg) + rauwolscine (300 microg/kg) + prazosin (100 microg/kg), SB224289 (300 microg/kg) + prazosin (100 microg/kg) + BRL44408 (1,000 microg/kg; alpha2A), SB224289 (300 microg/kg) + prazosin (100 microg/kg)+ imiloxan (1,000 microg/kg; alpha2B), or SB224289 (300 microg/kg) + prazosin (100 microg/kg) + MK912 (300 microg/kg; alpha2C). Each group received consecutive 1-min intracarotid infusions of ergotamine (0.56, 1, 1.8, 3.1, 5.6, 10 and 18 microg/min), following a cumulative schedule. In saline-pretreated animals, ergotamine induced dose-dependent decreases in external carotid blood flow without affecting arterial blood pressure or heart rate. These control responses were: unaffected by SB224289, BRL15572, rauwolscine or the combinations of SB224289 + BRL15572, BRL15572 + rauwolscine, rauwolscine + prazosin, SB224289 + prazosin, or SB224289 + prazosin + imiloxan; slightly blocked by SB224289 + rauwolscine; and markedly blocked by SB224289 + rauwolscine + prazosin, SB224289 + prazosin + BRL44408 or SB224289 + prazosin + MK912. Thus, the cranio-selective vasoconstriction elicited by ergotamine in dogs is predominantly mediated by 5-HT1B receptors as well as alpha2A/2C-adrenoceptor subtypes and, to a lesser extent, by alpha1-adrenoceptors.
23291341	Bombesin receptor subtype-3 (BRS-3), a novel candidate as therapeutic molecular target in obesity and diabetes.	BRS-3 KO-mice developed obesity and unbalanced glucose metabolism, suggesting an important role of BRS-3 receptor in glucose homeostasis. We explored BRS-3 expression in skeletal muscle from normal, obese or type-2 diabetic (T2D) patients, and the effect of [D-Phe(6), β-Ala(11),Phe(13),Nle(14)]bombesin(6-14)-BRS-3-agonist-peptide (BRS-3-AP) - on glucose-related effects, before or after BRS-3 gene silencing. In muscle tissue and primary cultured myocytes from altered metabolic states, BRS-3 gene/protein expressions were down-regulated. In normal, obese and T2D cells: A) BRS-3-AP as insulin enhanced BRS-3 and GLUT-4 mRNA/protein levels; improving glucotransporter translocation to plasma membrane, and B) BRS-3-AP caused a concentration-related-stimulation of glucose transport, being obese and T2D myocytes more sensitive to the ligand than normal. Wortmannin and PD98059, but not rapamycin, abolished the stimulatory action of BRS-3-AP on glucose transport. BRS-3 plays an important role in glucose metabolism, and could be use as a molecular target, and/or its ligand, as a therapeutic agent for obesity and diabetes treatments.
7875228	Alpha 1-adrenoceptor subtypes mediating the regulation and modulation of Ca2+ sensitization in rabbit thoracic aorta.	Norepinephrine (10 microM), methoxamine (100 microM) and clonidine (100 microM) with guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP, 50 microM) or guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma-S, 10 microM) all significantly enhanced the contraction induced by 0.3 microM Ca2+ (pCa6.5) in beta-escin-skinned smooth muscle of rabbit thoracic aorta. The enhancement of Ca2+ contraction produced by norepinephrine was greater than that produced by methoxamine or clonidine. In beta-escin-skinned strips of chloroethylclonidine-pretreated smooth muscle, the enhancement of Ca2+ contraction produced by norepinephrine was significantly decreased, whereas the amplitude was the same as that produced by methoxamine or clonidine; this enhancement was inhibited by the selective alpha 1A-adrenoceptor antagonist WB 4101 (100 nM). The enhancement of Ca2+ contraction produced by methoxamine and clonidine was not affected by chloroethylclonidine pretreatment. The effects of methoxamine, clonidine and norepinephrine in the chloroethylclonidine-pretreated tissue were all inhibited by guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDP beta-S, 1 mM) and 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-methylpiperazine (H-7, 20 microM). Furthermore, the phosphorylation of myosin light chain produced by norepinephrine was greater than that produced by clonidine. These results suggest that both alpha 1-adrenoceptor subtypes (alpha 1A and alpha 1B) increase the Ca2+ sensitivity of contractile elements, and that the Ca2+ sensitization produced by alpha 1A-subtype receptors is mediated through G-protein and protein kinase C, and plays an important role in contraction of smooth muscle of rabbit thoracic aorta.
23086748	Effects of silver nanoparticles on the liver and hepatocytes in vitro.	With the increasing use and incorporation of nanoparticles (NPs) into consumer products, screening for potential toxicity is necessary to ensure customer safety. NPs have been shown to translocate to the bloodstream following inhalation and ingestion, and such studies demonstrate that the liver is an important organ for accumulation. Silver (Ag) NPs are highly relevant for human exposure due to their use in food contact materials, dietary supplements, and antibacterial wound treatments. Due to the large number of different NPs already used in various products and being developed for new applications, it is essential that relevant, quick, and cheap methods of in vitro risk assessment suitable for these new materials are established. Therefore, this study used a simple hepatocytes model combined with an in vivo injection model to simulate the passage of a small amount of NPs into the bloodstream following exposure, e.g., via ingestion or inhalation, and examined the potential of Ag NPs of 20 nm diameter to cause toxicity, inflammation, and oxidative stress in the liver following in vivo exposures of female Wistar rats via iv injection to 50 μg of NPs and in vitro exposures using the human hepatocyte cell line C3A. We found that Ag NPs were highly cytotoxic to hepatocytes (LC(50) lactate dehydrogenase: 2.5 μg/cm(2)) and affected hepatocyte homeostasis by reducing albumin release. At sublethal concentrations with normal cell or tissue morphology, Ag NPs were detected in cytoplasm and nuclei of hepatocytes. We observed similar effects of Ag NPs on inflammatory mediator expression in vitro and in vivo with increase of interleukin-8 (IL-8)/macrophage inflammatory protein 2, IL-1RI, and tumor necrosis factor-α expression in both models and increased IL-8 protein release in vitro. This article presents evidence of the potential toxicity and inflammogenic potential of Ag NPs in the liver following ingestion. In addition, the similarities between in vitro and in vivo responses are striking and encouraging for future reduction, refinement, and replacement of animal studies by the use of hepatocyte cell lines in particle risk assessment.
15045033	Yttrium-90-ibritumomab tiuxetan radioimmunotherapy: a new treatment approach for B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.	"This article will review the clinical development of ibritumomab tiuxetan, a yttrium-90-conjugated monoclonal antibody to CD20, for patients with relapsed B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Ibritumomab is the murine parent anti-CD20 antibody that was engineered to make the human chimeric antibody rituximab. Tiuxetan is an MX-DTPA chelator that is linked to ibritumomab to form ibritumomab tiuxetan. Since yttrium-90 ((90)Y) is a pure beta emitter and cannot be used for patient imaging, indium-111 ((111)In) is chelated to ibritumomab tiuxetan for tumor and normal organ imaging in clinical practice and for dosimetry in clinical trials. (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan is the form used for therapy. This review discusses the clinical trials that have demonstrated the efficacy of ibritumomab tiuxetan and summarizes the safety data in patients with relapsed B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Two phase I trials of (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan were conducted to establish the toxicity profile and the maximum tolerated single dose that could be administered to outpatients without the use of stem cells or prophylactic growth factors. In the first trial, cold ibritumomab was used prior to ibritumomab tiuxetan; the second trial used the human chimeric antibody rituximab. The phase I trials determined that in patients with a platelet count of greater than or equal to 150 x 10(9)/l, a schedule of intravenous rituximab 250 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8, and 0.4 mCi/ kg of intravenous (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan on day 8 was safe and efficacious and did not require stem cells. A dose of 0.3 mCi/kg was recommended for patients with a baseline platelet count of 100,000- 149,000 x 10(6)/l. Adverse events were primarily hematologic, and nonhematologic adverse events were primarily due to rituximab. There was no normal organ toxicity. The overall response rate was 67% for all patients and 82% in patients with low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. A subsequent phase III trial randomized 143 eligible patients to either rituximab or ibritumomab tiuxetan. The aim was to demonstrate that the addition of the yttrium-90 radioisotope to the antibody provided additional efficacy over the unconjugated (""cold"") rituximab alone. The results of this study showed an overall response rate of 80% with (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan versus 56% for rituximab (p = 0.002). An additional trial enrolled 54 patients who were nonresponsive or refractory to rituximab and treated the patients with a single dose of 0.4 mCi/kg (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan. An overall response rate of 74% was found in these rituximab-refractory patients. These data provide further evidence of the added value of the yttrium-90. Finally, a fifth trial treated 30 patients with mild thrombocytopenia using 0.3 mCi/kg (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan and found an overall response rate of 83%. (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan radioimmunotherapy is a new treatment modality for patients with relapsed B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The advantages of this therapy are that it utilizes targeted radiation in a single-dose, outpatient schedule that is well tolerated and accepted by the patient. Future trials will build on these results and determine at what point in the disease course this modality can best be utilized to maximize the benefits to the patient."
23408858	Novel inhibition of archaeal family-D DNA polymerase by uracil.	Archaeal family-D DNA polymerase is inhibited by the presence of uracil in DNA template strands. When the enzyme encounters uracil, following three parameters change: DNA binding increases roughly 2-fold, the rate of polymerization slows by a factor of ∼5 and 3'-5' proof-reading exonuclease activity is stimulated by a factor of ∼2. Together these changes result in a significant decrease in polymerization activity and a reduction in net DNA synthesis. Pol D appears to interact with template strand uracil irrespective of its distance ahead of the replication fork. Polymerization does not stop at a defined location relative to uracil, rather a general decrease in DNA synthesis is observed. 'Trans' inhibition, the slowing of Pol D by uracil on a DNA strand not being replicated is also observed. It is proposed that Pol D is able to interact with uracil by looping out the single-stranded template, allowing simultaneous contact of both the base and the primer-template junction to give a polymerase-DNA complex with diminished extension ability.
15347780	Case-control study of multiple chemical sensitivity, comparing haematology, biochemistry, vitamins and serum volatile organic compound measures.	BACKGROUND: Multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS), although poorly understood, is associated with considerable morbidity. AIM: To investigate potential biological mechanisms underlying MCS in a case-control study. METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-three MCS cases and 194 controls (urban females, aged 30-64 years) fulfilled reproducible eligibility criteria with discriminant validity. Routine laboratory results and serum levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were compared. Dose-response relationships, a criterion for causality, were examined linking exposures to likelihood of case status. RESULTS: Routine laboratory investigations revealed clinically unimportant case-control differences in means. Confounder-adjusted odds ratios (OR) showed MCS was negatively associated with lymphocyte count and total plasma homocysteine, positively associated with mean cell haemoglobin concentration, alanine aminotransferase and serum vitamin B6, and not associated with thyroid stimulating hormone, folate or serum vitamin B12. More cases than controls had detectable serum chloroform (P = 0.001) with the OR for detectability 2.78 (95% confidence interval = 1.73-4.48, P < 0.001). Chloroform levels were higher in cases. However, cases had significantly lower means of detectable serum levels of ethylbenzene, m&p-xylene, 3-methylpentane and hexane, and means of all serum levels of 1,3,5- and 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene, 2- and 3-methylpentane, and m&p-xylene. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are inconsistent with proposals that MCS is associated with vitamin deficiency or thyroid dysfunction, but the association of lower lymphocyte counts with an increased likelihood of MCS is consistent with theories of immune dysfunction in MCS. Whether avoidance of exposures or different metabolic pathways in cases explain the observed lower VOC levels or the higher chloroform levels should be investigated.
1351412	Ocular beta-blockers in glaucoma management. Clinical pharmacological aspects.	Topical beta-blockers reduce the intraocular pressure (IOP) by blockade of sympathetic nerve endings in the ciliary epithelium causing a fall in aqueous humour production. Two types of topical beta-blockers are available for use in glaucoma: nonselective, which block both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors; and cardioselective, which block only beta 1-receptors. Of the beta-Blockers commercially available, timolol, levobunolol, metipranolol and carteolol are nonselective, and betaxolol is cardioselective. Twice-daily timolol is probably the most effective agent in lowering IOP, although levobunolol is equally effective and can be used once daily with little difference in effect. Carteolol is used twice daily and any theoretical advantage in diminished side effects conferred by its partial beta-agonist activity compared with timolol has not been fully substantiated. Metipranolol is effective twice daily and does not have partial beta-agonist activity. Betaxolol has an effect comparable to timolol in lowering IOP, but is less effective in some patients. beta-Blockers can be used with other antiglaucoma medications, but their combined action with epinephrine (adrenaline) is suspect, particularly in the case of the nonselective beta-blockers, and the effect should be assessed in patients on an individual basis. Local stinging can be a problem in some patients with betaxolol. The most serious side effects of beta-blockers are the exacerbation of chronic obstructive airways disease with nonselective agents and the precipitation of bronchospasm in some patients. Betaxolol seems relatively free of adverse respiratory effects, although this may be dose-related and extreme caution should still be exercised in patients with any history of respiratory illness. Because of the lower risk of precipitating side effects, betaxolol is probably the beta-blocker of first choice for use in glaucoma; timolol or levobunolol are reserved for patients who do not respond satisfactorily to betaxolol and are quite free of respiratory disease.
15325927	Effects of carvedilol on plasma B-type natriuretic peptide concentration and symptoms in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction.	Although the benefits of carvedilol in patients with heart failure and depressed ejection fraction (EF) have been elucidated, those in patients with preserved EF are not understood. We enrolled 40 patients with mild or moderate heart failure and EF >/=45%. They were randomly assigned to carvedilol (n = 19) or conventional therapy (n = 21). After 12 months of treatment, carvedilol significantly improved all end points (plasma concentration of B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP] from 175 (35 to 209) to 106 (52 to 160) pg/ml, mean (95% confidence interval) p <0.01; New York Heart Association functional class from 2.37 (2.13 to 2.61) to 1.56 (1.21 to 1.91), p <0.01; exercise capacity estimated with the Specific Activity Scale from 4.75 (4.50 to 5.00) to 5.68 (5.22 to 6.14) METs, p <0.02), whereas conventional therapy did not (plasma BNP concentration from 150 (114 to 186) to 174 (100 to 248) pg/ml; New York Heart Association functional class from 2.29 (2.08 to 2.50) to 2.11 (1.73 to 2.49); exercise capacity from 4.57 (4.34 to 4.80) to 4.72 (4.41 to 5.03) METs). Univariate regression analyses showed that only the use of carvedilol was correlated with the decrease in plasma BNP concentration (p <0.03). Multivariate analyses demonstrated that an ischemic cause of heart failure (p <0.02), high plasma concentration of BNP (p <0.02), left ventricular dilation (p <0.03), and use of carvedilol (p <0.04) at baseline were predictive of a decrease in plasma concentration of BNP. In conclusion, carvedilol potentially decreased neurohumoral activation, decreased symptoms, and increased exercise capacity in patients with heart failure and preserved EF.
23537747	Nobiletin attenuates metastasis via both ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways in HGF-treated liver cancer HepG2 cells.	Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and its receptor, c-Met activation has recently been shown to play important roles in cancer invasion and metastasis in a wide variety of tumor cells. We use HGF as an invasive inducer of human HepG2 cells to investigate the effect of four flavones including apigenin, tricetin, tangeretin, and nobiletin on HGF/c-Met-mediated tumor invasion and metastasis. Among them, nobiletin markedly inhibited HGF-induced the abilities of the adhesion, invasion, and migration by cell-matrix adhesion assay and transwell-chamber invasion/migration assay under non-cytotoxic concentrations. Data also showed nobiletin inhibited HGF-induced cell scattering and cytoskeleton changed such as filopodia and lamellipodia. Furthermore, nobiletin could inhibit HGF-induced the membrane localization of phosphorylated c-Met, ERK2, and Akt, but not phosphorylated JNK1/2 and p38. Next, nobiletin significantly decreased the levels of phospho-ERK2 and phospho-Akt in ERK2 or Akt siRNA-transfected cells concomitantly with a marked reduction on cell invasion and migration. In conclusion, nobiletin attenuates HGF-induced HepG2 cells metastasis involving both ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways and are potentially useful as anti-metastatic agents for the treatment of hepatoma.
23531160	Inflammation, serotonin and major depression.	The understanding of the neurobiological processes leading to major depressive disorder (MDD) is an active field of research in the scientific community. For years, the alteration of monoamine neurotransmission, in particular serotonin (5-HT), has been considered the most significant pathophysiological mechanism of the disorder. However, biological data supporting the postulated MDD-related monoamine alterations have been inconclusive, and the use of monoaminergic antidepressants has not yielded the expected results. In the last few years, it has been demonstrated that inflammatory pathways have a significant role in the pathophysiology of MDD. According to the cytokine hypothesis, the disorder would be due to a stress-related increased production of cytokines, including interleukins, tumor necrosis factor- α and interferon- α and γ . These, in turns, would cause the activation of the indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO), with subsequent production of tryptophan (TRP) catabolites along the IDO pathway (TRYCATs) and decreased availability of TRP and 5-HT. Besides monoamines, other molecular mechanisms, as those within the inflammatory pathways, should be taken into account in the attempt to clarify the pathophysiology of MDD and to improve its treatment.
17079868	Methionine synthase reductase polymorphisms are associated with serum osteocalcin levels in postmenopausal women.	Homocysteine (Hcy) is thought to play an important role in the development of osteoporosis and fracture. Methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) is an enzyme involved in the conversion of Hcy to methionine. We hypothesized that certain genetic polymorphisms of MTRR leading to reduced enzyme activity may cause hyperhomocysteinemia and affect bone metabolism. We therefore examined the associations of the A66G and C524T polymorphisms of the MTRR gene with bone mineral density (BMD) and serum osteocalcin levels in postmenopausal women. Although we did not detect any significant associations between MTRR polymorphisms and BMD or serum osteocalcin levels, we found that the 66G/524C haplotype, which has reduced enzyme activity, was significantly associated with serum osteocalcin levels in a gene-dose dependent manner (P = 0.002). That is, the highest osteocalcin levels (34.5 +/- 16.8 ng/ml) were observed in subjects bearing two copies, intermediate osteocalcin levels (32.6 +/- 14.4 ng/ml) were observed in subjects bearing one copy, and the lowest levels of osteocalcin (28.8 +/- 10.9 ng/ml) were observed in subjects bearing no copies. These results suggest that the 66G/524C haplotype of the MTRR gene affect bone turn over rate.
23238233	Four new triterpenoid saponins from the leaves of Panax japonicus grown in southern Miyazaki Prefecture (4).	Four new dammarane-type triterpenoid saponins such as chikusetsusaponin LM3 (1), chikusetsusaponin LM4 (2), chikusetsusaponin LM5 (3), chikusetsusaponin LM6 (4), and twenty known triterpenoid saponins such as ginsenoside Rb3 (5), ginsenoside Rc (6), ginsenoside Rd (7), ginsenoside Re (8), ginsenoside Rg1 (9), ginsenoside F3 (10), ginsenoside F5 (11), ginsenoside F6 (12), chikusetsusaponin IVa (13), chikusetsusaponin V (14), chikusetsusaponin L5 (15), chikusetsusaponin L9a (16), chikusetsusaponin L9bc (17), chikusetsusaponin L10 (18), chikusetsusaponin FK2 (19), chikusetsusaponin FK6 (20), chikusetsusaponin FK7 (21), chikusetsusaponin FT1 (22), chikusetsusaponin LM1 (23), and chikusetsusaponin LM2 (24), were isolated from the leaves of Panax japonicus C. A. MEYER collected in Miyazaki prefecture, Japan. The structures of new chikusetsusaponins were elucidated on the basis of spectral and physicochemical evidences.
22619007	Silibinin triggers apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest of SGC7901 cells.	Silibinin, a flavonoid compound, has shown to be of chemopreventive potential against many cancers. However, its efficacy against gastric cancer has not been well elucidated. Here, we assessed the activity of Silibinin on apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest in human gastric cells culture system using SGC-7901 as the model. Silibinin treatment could inhibit the cell growth and cause a prominent G2 phase arrest and apoptosis in dose- and time-dependent manner. In mechanistic studies, Silibinin decreased the protein level of p34cdc2, which might be the possible molecular mechanism of Silibinin efficacy on the growth inhibition in SGC-7901 cells. In addition, Silibinin caused an increase in p53 and p21 protein level as well as mRNA levels. Interestingly, Silibinin-induced apoptosis in SGC-7901 cells was independent of caspases activation. These results indicated that Silibinin is a cell-cycle regulator and apoptosis inducer in human gastric carcinoma SGC-7901 cells and might be used as a candidate chemopreventive agent for gastric carcinoma prevention and intervention.

23169608	Metabolism and pharmacokinetics of 3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) in humans: the role of cytochrome P450s and alcohol dehydrogenase in biotransformation.	3-n-Butylphthalide (NBP) is a cardiovascular drug currently used for the treatment of cerebral ischemia. The present study aims to investigate the metabolism, pharmacokinetics, and excretion of NBP in humans and identify the enzymes responsible for the formation of major metabolites. NBP underwent extensive metabolism after an oral administration of 200 mg NBP and 23 metabolites were identified in human plasma and urine. Principal metabolic pathways included hydroxylation on alkyl side chain, particularly at 3-, ω-1-, and ω-carbons, and further oxidation and conjugation. Approximately 81.6% of the dose was recovered in urine, mainly as NBP-11-oic acid (M5-2) and glucuronide conjugates of M5-2 and mono-hydroxylated products. 10-Keto-NBP (M2), 3-hydroxy-NBP (M3-1), 10-hydroxy-NBP (M3-2), and M5-2 were the major circulating metabolites, wherein the areas under the curve values were 1.6-, 2.9-, 10.3-, and 4.1-fold higher than that of NBP. Reference standards of these four metabolites were obtained through microbial biotransformation by Cunninghamella blakesleana. In vitro phenotyping studies demonstrated that multiple cytochrome P450 (P450) isoforms, especially CYP3A4, 2E1, and 1A2, were involved in the formation of M3-1, M3-2, and 11-hydroxy-NBP. Using M3-2 and 11-hydroxy-NBP as substrates, human subcellular fractions experiments revealed that P450, alcohol dehydrogenase, and aldehyde dehydrogenase catalyzed the generation of M2 and M5-2. Formation of M5-2 was much faster than that of M2, and M5-2 can undergo β-oxidation to yield phthalide-3-acetic acid in rat liver homogenate. Overall, our study demonstrated that NBP was well absorbed and extensively metabolized by multiple enzymes to various metabolites prior to urinary excretion.
10822066	Functional evidence that gastroprotection can be induced by activation of central alpha(2B)-adrenoceptor subtypes in the rat.	Clonidine injected intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) (0.47 nmol/rat) exerted gastric mucosal protective effect against acidified ethanol. Evidence was obtained that the gastroprotective effect of clonidine was blocked by i.c.v. injected alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonists yohimbine (non-subtype selective antagonist), prazosin and 2-[2-(4-(O-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl)ethyl]-4,4-dimethyl-1,3-(2 H, 4H)-isoquinolindione (ARC-239) (representative alpha(2B/2C)-adrenoceptor blocking agents) and opioid receptor antagonists naloxone (a non-selective, moderately mu-opioid receptor preferring antagonist), naltrindole and naltriben delta-opioid receptor antagonists). The centrally injected naltrindole (0.5 nmol/rat) antagonised also the gastroprotective effect of clonidine --but not that of the delta-agonist [D-Ala(2), D-Leu(5)]enkephalin--administered peripherally. The results suggest that central alpha(2B/2C)-adrenoceptor subtypes and opioid--particularly delta--receptors are likely to be involved in the gastric mucosal protective effect of clonidine.
17389249	Cooperation of the conserved aspartate 439 and bound amino acid substrate is important for high-affinity Na+ binding to the glutamate transporter EAAC1.	The neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC1 contains several conserved acidic amino acids in its transmembrane domain, which are possibly important in catalyzing transport and/or binding of co/countertransported cations. Here, we have studied the effects of neutralization by site-directed mutagenesis of three of these amino acid side chains, glutamate 373, aspartate 439, and aspartate 454, on the functional properties of the transporter. Transport was analyzed by whole-cell current recording from EAAC1-expressing mammalian cells after applying jumps in voltage, substrate, or cation concentration. Neutralization mutations in positions 373 and 454, although eliminating steady-state glutamate transport, have little effect on the kinetics and thermodynamics of Na(+) and glutamate binding, suggesting that these two positions do not constitute the sites of Na(+) and glutamate association with EAAC1. In contrast, the D439N mutation resulted in an approximately 10-fold decrease of apparent affinity of the glutamate-bound transporter form for Na(+), and an approximately 2,000-fold reduction in the rate of Na(+) binding, whereas the kinetics and thermodynamics of Na(+) binding to the glutamate-free transporter were almost unchanged compared to EAAC1(WT). Furthermore, the D439N mutation converted l-glutamate, THA, and PDC, which are activating substrates for the wild-type anion conductance, but not l-aspartate, into transient inhibitors of the EAAC1(D439) anion conductance. Activation of the anion conductance by l-glutamate was biphasic, allowing us to directly analyze binding of two of the three cotransported Na(+) ions as a function of time and [Na(+)]. The data can be explained with a model in which the D439N mutation results in a dramatic slowing of Na(+) binding and a reduced affinity of the substrate-bound EAAC1 for Na(+). We propose that the bound substrate controls the rate and the extent of Na(+) interaction with the transporter, depending on the amino acid side chain in position 439.
9138687	Pharmacological characterization of an alpha 1A-adrenoceptor mediating contractile responses to noradrenaline in isolated caudal artery of rat.	1. The alpha 1-adrenoceptor population mediating contraction of caudal artery of rat has been characterized by using quantitative receptor pharmacology. 2. Cumulative concentration-effect (E/[A]) curves to noradrenaline (NA) yielded a p[A]50 of 5.56 +/- 0.05 (n = 16). Prazosin caused concentration-dependent, parallel, dextral shifts of E/[A] curves to NA yielding a pKb of 8.9 (Schild regression slope = 1.0). RS-17053 (N-[2-(2-cyclopropyl methoxy phenoxy) ethyl]-5-chloro-alpha, alpha-dimethyl-1H-indole- 3-ethanamine hydrochloride; 10-100 nM), a selective alpha 1 A-adrenoceptor antagonist, produced non-parallel, biphasic, dextral shifts of E/[A] curves to NA, suggesting the involvement of more than one alpha 1-adrenoceptor subtype. Analysis of the high affinity component yielded an apparent pA2 value of 9.2 +/- 0.3. 3. A-61603, a selective agonist at alpha 1A adrenoceptors behaved as a full agonist relative to NA and yielded monophasic E/[A] curves with a p[A50] of 7.59 +/- 0.04 (n = 15). Pretreatment of tissues with chloroethylclonidine (CEC; 100 microM for 20 min, followed by 40 min washout), which preferentially alkylates alpha 1B- and alpha 1D-adrenoceptors, did not alter E/[A] curves to A-61603. Prazosin (3-300 nM) caused concentration-dependent, parallel, dextral shifts of E/[A] curves to A-61603 yielding a pA2 estimate of 9.2 +/- 0.2. 4. Experiments with alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists of varying subtype selectivities (RS-17053, SNAP 5089, tamsulosin, 5-methylurapidil, BMY 7378, HV 723 and REC 15/2739) revealed parallel dextral shifts of E/[A] curves to A-61603. Schild regression analyses yielded pA2 estimates of 9.2, 9.3, 11.2, 9.0, 6.3, 8.7 and 10.0 for RS-17053, SNAP 5089, tamsulosin, 5-methylurapidil, BMY 7378, HV 723 and REC 15/2739, respectively, although deviations from unit slope (possibly reflecting a secondary involvement of another alpha 1-adrenoceptor) hindered estimations of pKb for some antagonists. The antagonist affinity profile obtained reflects best that described for the alpha 1A-adrenoceptor. 5. In conclusion, caudal artery of rat contracts in response to NA via activation of at least two alpha 1-adrenoceptor subtypes. One of these subtypes displays the pharmacology of the alpha 1A-adrenoceptor, while the other remains to be defined. Use of the novel selective agonist, A-61603, allows for limited pharmacological isolation of the alpha 1A-adrenoceptor permitting characterization of the properties of selective antagonists.
23458950	Antioxidant and Anti-inflammatory Meroterpenoids from the Brown Alga Cystoseira usneoides.	A chemical study of the alga Cystoseira usneoides has led to the isolation of six new meroterpenoids, cystodiones A-F (1-6), together with six known related compounds (7-12). The structures of the new metabolites have been established by spectroscopic techniques. In antioxidant assays all of the tested meroterpenes, and in particular cystodiones A (1) and B (2), 6-cis-amentadione-1'-methyl ether (7), and amentadione-1'-methyl ether (8), exhibited strong radical-scavenging activity. In anti-inflammatory assays, usneoidone Z (11) and its corresponding 6E isomer (12) showed significant activity as inhibitors of the production of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α in LPS-stimulated THP-1 human macrophages.
2986673	Drug-protein interactions: binding of chlorpromazine to calmodulin, calmodulin fragments, and related calcium binding proteins.	The quantitative binding of a phenothiazine drug to calmodulin, calmodulin fragments, and structurally related calcium binding proteins was measured under conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium by using a gel filtration method. Plant and animal calmodulins, troponin C, S100 alpha, and S100 beta bind chlorpromazine in a calcium-dependent manner with different stoichiometries and affinities for the drug. The interaction between calmodulin and chlorpromazine appears to be a complex, calcium-dependent phenomenon. Bovine brain calmodulin bound approximately 5 mol of drug per mol of protein with apparent half-maximal binding at 17 microM drug. Large fragments of calmodulin had limited ability to bind chlorpromazine. The largest fragment, containing residues 1-90, retained only 5% of the drug binding activity of the intact protein. A reinvestigation of the chlorpromazine inhibition of calmodulin stimulation of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase further indicated a complex, multiple equilibrium among the reaction components and demonstrated that the order of addition of components to the reaction altered the drug concentration required for half-maximal inhibition of the activity over a 10-fold range. These results confirm previous observations using immobilized phenothiazines [Marshak, D.R., Watterson, D.M., & Van Eldik, L.J. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78, 6793-6797] that indicated a subclass of calcium-modulated proteins bound phenothiazines in a calcium-dependent manner, demonstrate that the interaction between phenothiazines and calmodulin is more complex than previously assumed, and suggest that extended regions of the calmodulin molecule capable of forming the appropriate conformation are required for specific, high-affinity, calcium-dependent drug binding activity.
23645211	Role of quercetin in cadmium-induced oxidative stress, neuronal damage, and apoptosis in rats.	The present study was carried out to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of quercetin (QE) in protecting the cadmium (Cd)-induced neuronal injury in frontal cortex of rats. A total of 30 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups of 10 animals each: control, Cd treated and Cd treated with QE. The Cd-treated group was injected subcutaneously with cadmium chloride (CdCl2) dissolved in saline at a dose of 2 ml/kg/day for 30 days, resulting in a dosage of 1 mg/kg Cd. The rats in QE-treated groups were given QE (15 mg/kg body weight) once a day intraperitoneally starting 2 days prior to Cd injection, during the study period. Rats were sacrificed at the end of the study and the frontal cortex tissues were removed for biochemical and histopathological investigation. To date, there is no available information on the effect of QE on neuronal injury after Cd exposure. Rats intoxicated with Cd for 30 days, significantly increased tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and significantly decreased enzymatic antioxidants superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase in the frontal cortex tissue. Administration of QE with Cd significantly diminished the levels of MDA and significantly elevated the levels of enzymatic antioxidants in the frontal cortex tissue. The histopathological studies in the brain of rats also supported that QE markedly reduced the Cd-induced histopathological changes and well preserved the normal histological architecture of the frontal cortex tissue. The caspase-3 immunopositivity was increased in degenerating neurons of the Cd group. Treatment with QE markedly reduced the immunoreactivity of degenerating neurons. In conclusion, the results of the current study suggest that QE may be beneficial in combating the Cd-induced neurotoxicity in the brain of rats. We believe that further preclinical research into the utility of QE may indicate its usefulness as a potential treatment for neurodegeneration after Cd exposure in rats.
23328072	Dose-dependent effects of vitamin D on transdifferentiation of skeletal muscle cells to adipose cells.	Fat infiltration within muscle is one of a number of features of vitamin D deficiency, which leads to a decline in muscle functionality. The origin of this fat is unclear, but one possibility is that it forms from myogenic precursor cells present in the muscle, which transdifferentiate into mature adipocytes. The current study examined the effect of the active form of vitamin D₃, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D₃ (1,25(OH)₂D₃), on the capacity of the C2C12 muscle cell line to differentiate towards the myogenic and adipogenic lineages. Cells were cultured in myogenic or adipogenic differentiation media containing increasing concentrations (0, 10⁻¹³, 10⁻¹¹, 10⁻⁹, 10⁻⁷ or 10⁻⁵  M) of 1,25(OH)₂D₃ for up to 6 days and markers of muscle and fat development measured. Mature myofibres were formed in both adipogenic and myogenic media, but fat droplets were only observed in adipogenic media. Relative to controls, low physiological concentrations (10⁻¹³ and 10⁻¹¹  M) of 1,25(OH)₂D3 increased fat droplet accumulation, whereas high physiological (10⁻⁹  M) and supraphysiological concentrations (≥10⁻⁷  M) inhibited fat accumulation. This increased accumulation of fat with low physiological concentrations (10⁻¹³ and 10⁻¹¹  M) was associated with a sequential up-regulation of PPARγ2 (PPARG) and FABP4 mRNA, indicating formation of adipocytes, whereas higher concentrations (≥10⁻⁹  M) reduced all these effects, and the highest concentration (10⁻⁵  M) appeared to have toxic effects. This is the first study to demonstrate dose-dependent effects of 1,25(OH)₂D₃ on the transdifferentiation of muscle cells into adipose cells. Low physiological concentrations (possibly mimicking a deficient state) induced adipogenesis, whereas higher (physiological and supraphysiological) concentrations attenuated this effect.
23052195	Neuropeptide Y Y1 receptor knockdown can modify glutathione peroxidase and c-AMP response element-binding protein in phenylpropanolamine-treated rats.	It has been reported that antioxidative enzymes, neuropeptide Y (NPY), and c-AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) are involved in regulating phenylpropanolamine (PPA)-mediated appetite suppression. Here, we investigated whether Y1 receptor (Y1R) might be involved in this regulation. Rats were daily treated with PPA for 4 days. Changes in the contents of NPY, Y1R, glutathione peroxidase (GP), and CREB were assessed and compared. Results showed that Y1R, GP, and CREB increased, with a maximal increase about 100, 200, and 150 %, respectively, on Day 2. By contrast, NPY decreased with a biggest reduction about 48 % on Day 2 and the pattern of expression during PPA treatment was opposite to those of Y1R, GP, and CREB. Central knockdown (using antisense) or inhibition (using antagonist) of Y1R expression modulated the anorectic response of PPA and the reciprocal regulation between NPY and GP (or CREB), revealing an essential role of Y1R in regulating NPY, GP, and CREB. These results suggest that Y1R participates in the reciprocal regulation of NPY, GP, and CREB in the hypothalamus during PPA treatment in conscious rats. The present results may aid the therapeutic research of PPA and related antiobesity drugs.
23578651	Development and validation of ethylenethiourea determination in foods using methanol-based extraction, solid-phase extraction cleanup and LC-MS/MS.	To response to the need for a rapid, cost-effective, eco-friendly and efficient extraction process, a sensitive method for the determination of ethylenethiourea (ETU) in food matrices by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-LC/MS) was developed and validated. ETU was extracted from food commodities with methanol, cleaned up by alumina-SPE column, and then determined by HPLC-MS/MS. The MS detection was operated in positive ionization mode. For confirmation of target compound, two precursor ion>product ion transitions were selected by multi-reaction monitoring mode (MRM). The method showed good linearity with correlation coefficient higher than 0.9950. Recoveries at three spiked levels (10, 50, 100ng/g) in random selected food matrices were in range of 71-121% with RSDs not larger than 25%. The limit of quantitation for the analyte was estimated at 5ng/g.
16835302	The active metabolite of Clopidogrel disrupts P2Y12 receptor oligomers and partitions them out of lipid rafts.	P2Y12, a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a central role in platelet activation has been recently identified as the receptor targeted by the antithrombotic drug, clopidogrel. In this study, we further deciphered the mechanism of action of clopidogrel and of its active metabolite (Act-Met) on P2Y12 receptors. Using biochemical approaches, we demonstrated the existence of homooligomeric complexes of P2Y12 receptors at the surface of mammalian cells and in freshly isolated platelets. In vitro treatment with Act-Met or in vivo oral administration to rats with clopidogrel induced the breakdown of these oligomers into dimeric and monomeric entities in P2Y12 expressing HEK293 and platelets respectively. In addition, we showed the predominant association of P2Y12 oligomers to cell membrane lipid rafts and the partitioning of P2Y12 out of rafts in response to clopidogrel and Act-Met. The raft-associated P2Y12 oligomers represented the functional form of the receptor, as demonstrated by binding and signal transduction studies. Finally, using a series of receptors individually mutated at each cysteine residue and a chimeric P2Y12/P2Y13 receptor, we pointed out the involvement of cysteine 97 within the first extracellular loop of P2Y12 in the mechanism of action of Act-Met.
23495691	Targeting protein-protein interactions within the cyclic AMP signaling system as a therapeutic strategy for cardiovascular disease.	The cAMP signaling system can trigger precise physiological cellular responses that depend on the fidelity of many protein-protein interactions, which act to bring together signaling intermediates at defined locations within cells. In the heart, cAMP participates in the fine control of excitation-contraction coupling, hence, any disregulation of this signaling cascade can lead to cardiac disease. Due to the ubiquitous nature of the cAMP pathway, general inhibitors of cAMP signaling proteins such as PKA, EPAC and PDEs would act non-specifically and universally, increasing the likelihood of serious 'off target' effects. Recent advances in the discovery of peptides and small molecules that disrupt the protein-protein interactions that underpin cellular targeting of cAMP signaling proteins are described and discussed.
16809898	Effect of chronic renal failure on arginase and argininosuccinate synthetase expression.	BACKGROUND: L-arginine (L-arg) participates in numerous biological functions including urea and nitric oxide synthesis. Sources of L-arg include dietary proteins and endogenous synthesis by argininosuccinate synthetase and argininosuccinate lyase. L-arg is converted to urea by arginase I in the liver and arginase II in the kidney. Normally, the liver fully consumes L-arg for urea generation and does not contribute to its circulating pool. Instead, much of the circulating L-arg is produced by the kidney. If true, plasma L-arg should be severely reduced in chronic renal failure (CRF); however, plasma L-arg is frequently unchanged in CRF. We hypothesized that preservation of plasma L-arg in CRF may be, partly, due to downregulation/inhibition of arginase. METHODS: Argininosuccinate synthetase, arginase I and II protein abundance and activity were measured in the liver and kidneys of rats 6 weeks after 5/6 nephrectomy or sham operation. In addition, arginase activity was measured in the presence of different urea concentrations to simulate azotemia in vitro. RESULTS: Arginases I and II protein abundance as well as arginase activity in the liver, measured in the physiological buffer, were similar among the CRF and control groups. However, in vitro experiments simulating a uremic milieu revealed a marked concentration-dependent inhibition of arginase activity by urea in the tissue lysates. CRF had no significant effect on argininosuccinate synthetase abundance in the kidney, liver, spleen or intestine. CONCLUSIONS: Although CRF does not change the abundance or intrinsic properties of arginase, the inherent rise in urea concentration inhibits its enzymatic activity. The latter, in turn, attenuates L-arg catabolism and urea production and, thereby, mitigates the fall in plasma L-arg.
18041889	Abatacept: a novel treatment for moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis.	Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disease that often leads to functional disability and reduced quality of life. The pathogenesis of synovial inflammation that is associated with this disease is thought to result from T-cell activation. To become fully activated, T cells require an antigen-specific signal through the T-cell receptor and a second signal through a costimulatory receptor. Abatacept is the first drug in a new class of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) known as selective costimulation modulators. Costimulation modulators block the second signal and decrease T-cell activation. Abatacept has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for reducing signs and symptoms, inducing major clinical response, slowing the progression of structural damage, and improving physical function in adults with moderate-to-severe active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to at least one other DMARD, such as methotrexate or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitors. Randomized controlled trials have shown that abatacept improves both clinical outcomes and health-related quality of life in patients who have had an inadequate response to other DMARDs. Abatacept has been shown to be well tolerated. In clinical trials, however, abatacept treatment was associated with a higher rate of infections compared with placebo. This finding was compounded when abatacept was used with TNF-alpha inhibitors; thus, this combination should be avoided. Abatacept appears to be a useful treatment option for patients with rheumatoid arthritis who have previously failed other DMARDs. However, additional clinical trials evaluating its long-term effect on patient safety and disease outcomes are needed.
2568212	Nonsedating histamine H1-receptor antagonists.	The chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, and dosages of the nonsedating histamine H1-receptor antagonists terfenadine, astemizole, loratadine, and acrivastine are reviewed. Terfenadine and astemizole are chemically unrelated to histamine H1-receptor antagonists such as diphenhydramine and chlorpheniramine. Loratadine is structurally related to the antihistamine azatadine, and acrivastine is a side-chain-reduced metabolite of the antihistamine triprolidine. Like other histamine H1-receptor antagonists, they competitively block histamine receptor sites rather than inhibiting histamine release. All four drugs have relatively long half-lives and are rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Terfenadine, astemizole, and loratadine are metabolized extensively in the liver; terfenadine and astemizole are both 97% protein bound. Terfenadine 60 mg twice daily has been shown to be as effective as conventional antihistamines for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis. In clinical trials, astemizole 10 mg daily was comparable to or better than chlorpheniramine for treatment of chronic rhinitis. Both terfenadine and astemizole were effective for treatment of chronic urticaria. For treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis, loratadine combined with pseudoephedrine may be preferable to triprolidine-pseudoephedrine and acrivastine-pseudoephedrine combinations that require more frequent dosing. Acrivastine must be administered more frequently than the other nonsedating antihistamines. None of these four agents impairs psychomotor activity. Infrequently reported adverse effects include dry mouth, skin reactions, and weight gain. The absence of substantial sedative effects and the less-frequent dosing schedules make these agents good alternatives to the classic antihistamines for treatment of seasonal and chronic rhinitis and chronic urticaria.
23568554	Cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein- a vital link in embryonic hormonal adaptation.	The transcription factor cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein (CREB) and activating transcription factors (ATFs) are downstream components of the insulin/IGF cascade, playing crucial roles in maintaining cell viability and embryo survival. One of the CREB target genes is adiponectin which acts synergistically with insulin. We have studied the CREB-ATF-adiponectin network in rabbit preimplantation development in vivo and in vitro.From the blastocyst stage onwards CREB and ATF1, 3 and 4 are present with increasing expression for CREB, ATF1 and 3 during gastrulation and with a dominant expression in the embryoblast (EB). In vitro stimulation with insulin and IGF1 reduced CREB and ATF1 transcripts by approx. 50%, while CREB phosphorylation was increased. Activation of CREB was accompanied by subsequent reduction in adiponectin and adiponectin receptor 1 (adipoR1) expression.Under in vivo conditions of diabetes type 1, maternal adiponectin levels were up-regulated in serum and endometrium. Embryonic CREB expression was altered in a cell lineage-specific pattern. While in EB cells CREB localization did not change, it was translocated from the nucleus into the cytosol in trophoblast (TB) cells. In TB adiponectin expression was increased [diabetic 427.8±59.3 pg/ml versus normoinsulinaemic 143.9±26.5 pg/ml], while it was no longer measureable in the EB. Analysis of embryonic adiponectin receptors showed an increased expression of adipoR1 and no changes in adipoR2 transcription.We conclude that the transcription factors CREB and ATFs vitally participate in embryo-maternal crosstalk prior to implantation in a cell lineage-specific manner. Embryonic CREB/ATFs act as insulin/IGF sensors. Lack of insulin is compensated by a CREB-mediated adiponectin expression which may maintain glucose uptake in blastocysts grown in diabetic mothers.
23585058	NMDA Receptor Activation Down-Regulates Expression of δ Subunit-Containing GABA-A Receptors in Cultured Hippocampal Neurons.	Neurosteroids are endogenous allosteric modulators of γ amino-butyric acid type A receptors (GABARs), and enhance GABAR-mediated inhibition. However, GABARs expressed on hippocampal dentate granule neurons of epileptic animals are modified such that their neurosteroid sensitivity is reduced and δ subunit expression is diminished. The molecular mechanisms triggering this GABAR plasticity were explored. In the cultured hippocampal neurons treatment with NMDA (10 μM) for 48 hrs reduced surface expression of δ and α4 subunits, but did not increase expression of γ2 subunits. The tonic current recorded from neurons in NMDA-treated cultures was reduced, and its neurosteroid modulation was also diminished. In contrast, synaptic inhibition and its modulation by neurosteroids were preserved in these neurons. The time course of NMDA effects on surface and total δ subunit expression were distinct; shorter (6 hrs) treatment decreased surface expression, whereas longer treatment reduced both surface and total expression. APV blocked NMDA effects on δ subunit expression. Chelation of calcium ions by BAPTA-AM or blockade of ERK1/2 activation by UO126 also prevented the NMDA effects. Thus prolonged activation of NMDA receptors in hippocampal neurons reduced GABAR δ subunit expression through Ca2+ entry and at least in part by ERK1/2 activation.
20025554	Combination therapy with mitiglinide and voglibose improves glycemic control in type 2 diabetic patients on hemodialysis.	OBJECTIVE: Mitiglinide, a rapid- and short-acting insulinotropic sulfonylurea receptor ligand, exhibits hypoglycemic action unlike other sulfonylureas. The efficacy of the combination of mitiglinide and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors for diabetic patients on hemodialysis (HD) has not been prospectively evaluated; therefore, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of mitiglinide in these patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed an open-label randomized study with 36 type 2 diabetics with poor glycemic control on HD and receiving daily doses of voglibose (0.9 mg). The patients were randomly assigned to two groups: a combination-therapy group (mitiglinide group), mitiglinide initial dose 7.5 - 15 mg titrated to 30 mg daily and constant daily dose 0.9 mg of voglibose, and a monotherapy group (control group), constant daily dose 0.9 mg of voglibose alone. The efficacy of the treatment was determined by monitoring plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1c (Hb(A1c)), and glycated albumin (GA) levels and using homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Safety and tolerance were determined by monitoring clinical and laboratory parameters. RESULTS: The final dose of mitiglinide was 22.9 +/- 8.9 (mean +/- s.d.) mg (0.41 mg/kg) daily. Mitiglinide reduced fasting plasma glucose and GA levels after 4 weeks and Hb(A1c) levels after 8 weeks. Triglyceride levels and HOMA-IR values also decreased significantly after mitiglinide treatment. No significant changes in blood pressure levels or serious adverse effects such as hypoglycemia or liver impairment were observed. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests a combination therapy of mitiglinide and voglibose may have potential for the treatment of diabetics on HD. Due to the small sample size used, further studies should be performed, particularly to assess the safety of mitiglinide treatment.
23353902	Gender-specific effects of fluoxetine on hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor phosphorylation and behavior in chronically stressed rats.	Chronic psychosocial isolation stress (CPSI) modulates glucocorticoid receptor (GR) functioning in Wistar male rat hippocampus (HIPPO) through alteration of nuclear GR phosphorylation and its upstream kinases signaling, which parallels animal depressive-like behavior. The current study investigated potential gender specificities regarding the effect of chronic therapy by an antidepressant fluoxetine (FLU) on GR signaling in HIPPO and depressive-like behavior in CPSI animals. FLU was administrated to female and male naïve or CPSI rats for 21 days and GR protein, its phosphorylation status and upstream kinases, as well as GR and BDNF mRNA were followed in HIPPO together with animal serum corticosterone (CORT) and depressive-like behavior. The results showed that CPSI increased immobility in males versus hyperactivity in females and disrupted nuclear pGR232-Cdk5 pathway and JNK signaling in a gender-specific way. In contrast, in both genders CPSI increased the nuclear levels of GR and pGR246 but decreased CORT and mRNA levels of GR and BDNF. Concomitant FLU normalized the depressive-like behavior and altered the nuclear pGR232-Cdk5 signaling in a gender-specific manner. In both females and males, FLU reversed the nuclear levels of GR and pGR246 without affecting CORT and GR mRNA levels. In contrast, FLU exhibited gender-specific effect on BDNF mRNA in CPSI animals, by increasing it in females, but not in males. In spite of normalization the total nuclear GR level upon FLU treatment in both gender, down-regulation of GR mRNA is possibly maintained through prevalence of pGR232 isoform only in males. The gender-specific alterations of pGR232-Cdk5 signaling and BDNF gene expression in HIPPO and normalization of depressive-like behavior upon FLU treatment distinguishes this signaling pathway as potential future antidepressant target for gender-specific therapy of stress related mood disorders.
6311012	Penicillin-binding proteins and role of amdinocillin in causing bacterial cell death.	The activity of penicillins against bacteria is in large part related to binding to specific receptor proteins involved in cell wall biosynthesis. These proteins have been designated penicillin-binding proteins. They can be separated into distinct entities through the use of acrylamide gel electrophoresis and binding of radioactive 14C-labeled penicillin G. Six major proteins have been defined in the Enterobacteriaceae, penicillin-binding proteins 1 to 6. Selection of mutants has shown that there are three essential proteins: penicillin-binding protein 1, which is divided into penicillin-binding protein 1Bs, a peptidoglycan transpeptidase, and penicillin-binding protein 1A, which acts as a replacement for penicillin-binding protein 1Bs. Penicillin-binding protein 2 is a murein-elongation initiating enzyme and penicillin-binding protein 3 is a septal murein-synthesizing enzyme. Penicillin-binding proteins 4, 5, and 6 are not essential for bacterial survival. Binding of penicillins to penicillin-binding protein 1Bs produces lysis, binding to penicillin-binding protein 2 produces round cells, and binding to penicillin-binding protein 3 produces long filaments. Amdinocillin is a beta-amidino penicillanic acid derivative that binds specifically to penicillin-binding protein 2. The compound is more beta-lactamase stable than ampicillin and has no major delay in entry into the periplasmic space as do some penicillins. Amdinocillin inhibits most of the Enterobacteriaceae, with the exception of some indole-positive Proteus species, but it does not inhibit gram-positive cocci or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Amdinocillin produces spherical bacterial cells that eventually lyse. Its activity in vitro is markedly affected by ionic content of media. This agent acts synergistically with many penicillins, such as ampicillin, carbenicillin, and the like, and with cephalosporins, cefazolin, cefamandole, or cefoxitin to inhibit gram-negative bacilli, probably on the basis of binding to different proteins needed for the production of the peptidoglycan of the bacterial cell wall. Amdinocillin possesses a number of the essentials for effective antimicrobial activity and, by virtue of its enhancement of the activity of other beta-lactams, may prove to be a useful agent in the chemotherapy of certain infections.
23412992	Cardiotonic steroids-mediated Na+/K+-ATPase targeting could circumvent various chemoresistance pathways.	Many cancer patients fail to respond to chemotherapy because of the intrinsic resistance of their cancer to pro-apoptotic stimuli or the acquisition of the multidrug resistant phenotype during chronic treatment. Previous data from our groups and from others point to the sodium/potassium pump (the Na+/K+-ATPase, i.e., NaK) with its highly specific ligands (i.e., cardiotonic steroids) as a new target for combating cancers associated with dismal prognoses, including gliomas, melanomas, non-small cell lung cancers, renal cell carcinomas, and colon cancers. Cardiotonic steroid-mediated Na+/K+-ATPase targeting could circumvent various resistance pathways. The most probable pathways include the involvement of Na+/K+-ATPase β subunits in invasion features and Na+/K+-ATPase α subunits in chemosensitisation by specific cardiotonic steroid-mediated apoptosis and anoïkis-sensitisation; the regulation of the expression of multidrug resistant-related genes; post-translational regulation, including glycosylation and ubiquitinylation of multidrug resistant-related proteins; c-Myc downregulation; hypoxia-inducible factor downregulation; NF-κB downregulation and deactivation; the inhibition of the glycolytic pathway with a reduction of intra-cellular ATP levels and an induction of non-apoptotic cell death. The aims of this review are to examine the various molecular pathways by which the NaK targeting can be more deleterious to biologically aggressive cancer cells than to normal cells.
23439479	Biosafety and antioxidant effects of a beverage containing silymarin and arginine. A pilot, human intervention cross-over trial.	The study objective was to investigate the potential of a beverage containing silymarin and l-arginine to alter basic physiological and urodynamic parameters in 22 normal healthy men aged 38-59years. The volunteers drank 500ml/day beverage without silymarin and l-arginine for 10days followed, after a 7-day washout period, by the beverage with 400mg silymarin and 295mg l-arginine for 10days. Blood and urine samples were collected on days 0, 10 and 27. The beverages were well-tolerated with no adverse effects. Most of the biochemical, hematological and urodynamic parameters remained unchanged. Total antioxidant capacity, total level of antioxidants, lipoperoxidation products (malondialdehyde), advanced oxidation products of proteins in plasma and glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase and catalase levels in erythrocytes were not influenced. Serum γ-glutamyl transferase, malondialdehyde level and activity of glutathione S-transferase in erythrocytes were lowered at day 27 and the concentration of total plasma SH-groups was higher on day 10. Using an ex vivo system, we found that silymarin/silybin at 10-100μM is able to adsorb onto human erythrocytes and the complexes displayed antioxidant properties as studied using ex situ square-wave voltammetry. The trial showed that silymarin in vivo may protect erythrocytes against oxidative damage.
15992934	Molecular tools to study melatonin pathways and actions.	Melatonin, an indoleamine neurohormone that is synthesized mainly in the pineal gland and derived from 5-HT, has many effects on a wide range of physio-pathological functions. Some of these effects are mediated by the interactions of melatonin with the two melatonin MT1 and MT2 receptors. Other effects are often suggested to be due to the chemical antioxidant nature of this indoleamine, and are observed at high, non-physiological concentrations. However, it is increasingly believed that some of these effects are due to interactions with other protein targets. In this review, we summarize the molecular pharmacology of melatonin, including the main enzymes involved in its synthesis and catabolism, and the proteins that mediate its actions. Furthermore, various compounds, mainly inhibitors and antagonists, that can be used to dissect these functions and pathways are presented.
22986456	Decreased serum chemerin levels in male Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes: sex dimorphism.	Chemerin, a recently discovered adipocytokine plays an important role in obesity and obesity-associated metabolic complications. However, the role of chemerin in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has not fully been elucidated. We compared the serum chemerin levels and metabolic parameters between 88 control subjects, 86 patients with metabolic syndrome (MS), and 147 patients with T2DM in a Japanese population and further analyzed their correlation. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the serum chemerin levels. The chemerin levels were significantly higher in male than in female control subjects (p < 0.005), with significant decreases in patients with T2DM compared with those with MS and control subjects (164.9 ± 6.3 ng/mL vs. 209.8 ± 7.7 and 218.7 ± 7.3 ng/mL; p < 0.0001 vs. p < 0.0001, respectively) but no significant differences in female subjects. The multiple regression analysis revealed that the chemerin levels negatively correlated with the fasting glucose and HbA1c levels in total and male subjects. In the patients with T2DM, the chemerin levels negatively correlated with fasting glucose and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol but positively correlated with body mass index (BMI), and total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. The negative correlation between the chemerin and fasting glucose levels remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, and BMI in the total and male subjects and those with T2DM. These results suggest the role of chemerin in sex dimorphism and a potential link between chemerin levels and T2DM pathogenesis in a Japanese population.
23483201	Effects of treatment with a carbon monoxide-releasing molecule and a heme oxygenase 1 inducer in the antinociceptive effects of morphine in different models of acute and chronic pain in mice.	RATIONALE: Treatment with a carbon monoxide-releasing molecule (tricarbonyldichlororuthenium(II) dimer, CORM-2) or a classical heme oxygenase 1 inducer (cobalt protoporphyrin IX, CoPP) has potent anti-inflammatory effects, but the role played by these treatments in the antinociceptive effects of morphine during acute and chronic pain was not evaluated. OBJECTIVES: In wild type (WT), neuronal (NOS1-KO), or inducible (NOS2-KO) nitric oxide synthases knockout mice, we evaluated the effects of CORM-2 and CoPP treatments in the antinociceptive actions of morphine and their interaction with nitric oxide during acute, visceral, and chronic inflammatory or neuropathic pain. METHODS: Acute and visceral pain was assessed through formalin and acid acetic writhing tests. Chronic inflammatory pain induced by the intra-articular administration of complete Freund's adjuvant and neuropathic pain by partial ligation of sciatic nerve were evaluated by measuring allodynia and hyperalgesia using the von Frey filaments, plantar, or cold plate tests. RESULTS: While nitric oxide, synthetized by NOS1 and/or NOS2, increased the local antinociceptive effects of morphine during acute and chronic pain, it decreased the inhibitory effects of morphine after visceral pain. Moreover, while CORM-2 or CoPP treatments did not alter or reduced the antinociceptive effects of morphine during acute and visceral pain, both treatments improved the local antiallodynic and antihyperalgesic effects of morphine after chronic inflammatory or neuropathic pain in WT, but not in KO mice. CONCLUSIONS: CORM-2 and CoPP treatments improved the local antinociceptive effects of morphine during chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain by interaction with nitric oxide synthetized by NOS1 and NOS2 isoforms.
23522564	Addition of artificial salt bridge by Ile646Lys mutation in gp41 coiled-coil domain regulates 6-helical bundle formation.	HIV entry is mediated by the envelope glycoproteins gp120 and gp41. The gp41 subunit contains several functional domains: the N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR) domains fold a triple stranded coiled-coil forming a meta-stable prefusion intermediate. C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR) subsequently folds onto the hydrophobic grooves of the NHR coiled-coil to form a stable 6-helix bundle, which juxtaposes the viral and cellular membranes for fusion. The C34 which has 34 amino acid residues is known as the core structure in CHR. A highly anti-HIV peptide inhibitor derived from C34 was designed. An artificial salt bridge was added in the 6-helical bundle by substitution of lysine for Ile646. With a cholesterol modification at C-terminal, the inhibitor containing I646K mutation represented higher anti-viral activity than C34-cholesterol combination without mutation.
15106733	Salicylate regulates COX-2 expression through ERK and subsequent NF-kappaB activation in osteoblasts.	The expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a characteristic response to inflammation and can be inhibited with sodium salicylate. TNF-alpha plus IFN-gamma can induce extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), IKK, IkappaB degradation and NF-kappaB activation. The inhibition of the ERK pathway with selective inhibitor, PD098059, blocked cytokine-induced COX-2 expression and PGE2 release. Salicylate treatment inhibited COX-2 expression induced by TNF-alpha/IFN-gamma and regulated the activation of ERK, IKK and IkappaB degradation and subsequent NF-kappaB activation in MC3T3E1 osteoblasts. As well, antioxidant-catalase, N-acetyl-cysteine or reduced glutathione-attenuated COX-2 expression in combined cytokines-treated cells. These antioxidants also inhibited the activation of ERK, IKK and NF-kappaB in MC3T3E1 osteoblasts. In addition, TNF-alpha/IFN-gamma stimulated ROS release in the osteoblasts. However salicylate had no obvious effect on ROS release in DCFDA assay. The results showed that salicylate inhibited the activation of ERK and IKK, IkappaB degradation and NF-kappaB activation independent of ROS release and suggested that salicylate exerts its anti-inflammatory action in part through inhibition of the ERK, IKK, IkappaB, NF-kappaB and resultant COX-2 expression pathway.
12589193	Arginine availability, arginase, and the immune response.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Arginine, often found in immunonutrition regimens, is an important modulator of immune system activation. However, the mechanism of how arginine may be beneficial in immunonutrition is poorly understood. This review details the importance of arginine, its metabolism, and ultimately, its physiologic role in critically ill and immunocompromised patients. RECENT FINDINGS: The metabolism of arginine is determined by the expression of the arginine metabolizing enzymes inducible nitric oxide synthase and two arginase isoforms (arginase I and II). Inducible nitric oxide synthase is induced by T helper I cytokines (interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor and gamma-interferon), while arginases are induced by T helper II cytokines and other immune regulators such as interleukins 4, 10, and 13, transforming growth factor-beta and prostaglandin E2. Endotoxin induces inducible nitric oxide synthase and arginases I and II. Arginase plays an important role in the production of ornithine, a precursor of proline and polyamines, both of which are necessary for cellular proliferation and wound healing. Arginase also induces nitric oxide synthase activity by competing for arginine availability in the extracellular environment, and producing polyamines, which may modulate macrophage activation. Through limitation of arginine availability in the extracellular environment, arginases also potentially regulate other 'arginine-dependent' immune functions such as T-lymphocyte activation, although this hypothesis remains to be proven. SUMMARY: The availability of arginine during critical illness may be regulated by arginase activity. Thus, arginase expression appears to be essential in the regulation of the cellular immune response and the inflammatory process during critical illness.
11053214	A comparison of agonist-specific coupling of cloned human alpha(2)-adrenoceptor subtypes.	The agonist-specific coupling properties of the three cloned human alpha(2)-adrenoceptor subtypes have been compared, when expressed at similar levels in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines, using noradrenaline and (+/-)-meta-octopamine as agonists. Noradrenaline can couple the receptor to both the inhibition and stimulation of forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production in all three receptor subtypes, with the relative strength of the coupling to the pathways varying for each of the receptor subtypes. meta-Octopamine selectively couples the alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor only to the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production. However, meta-octopamine couples the alpha(2B)- and alpha(2C)-adrenoceptors to both the inhibition and stimulation of forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production. The relative potency of meta-octopamine to noradrenaline varies between the different alpha(2)-adrenoceptor subtypes. The effects of meta-octopamine are around two orders of magnitude less potent than those of noradrenaline on both the alpha(2A)- and alpha(2B)-adrenoceptor subtypes. In contrast, in the case of the alpha(2C)-adrenoceptor, meta-octopamine is only one order of magnitude less potent than noradrenaline in the stimulation of forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production and, in addition, is equipotent with noradrenaline in the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production and has an increased maximal response. This raises the possibility that meta-octopamine may have physiologically important actions via alpha(2C)-adrenoceptors in vivo. The results show that the modulation of cyclic AMP production occurs in both a subtype- and agonist-specific manner for alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors and in a subtype specific manner for alpha(2B)- and alpha(2C)-adrenoceptors.
23551329	Low-Dose Dexamethasone Treatment Promotes Pro-Survival Signalling Pathway In Adult Rat Prefrontal Cortex.	Synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX), a highly potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agent, is widely used in treatments of brain cancer, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The objective of the current study was to determine whether a low-dose subchronic DEX treatment (100 μg/kg for 8 consecutive days) exerts long-term effects on apoptosis in the adult rat prefrontal cortex (PFC) by examining the expression of cell death-promoting molecules (poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), p53, procaspase 3, cleaved caspase 3, Bax) and cell-survival molecules (AKT, Bcl-2). Our results revealed that body, thymus and adrenal weight as well corticosterone level in the serum and PFC were reduced a day following last DEX injection. In PFC, DEX caused activation of AKT, augmentation of pro-survival Bcl-2 protein and enhanced Bcl-2/Bax protein ratio, as well Bcl-2 translocation to mitochondria. The unaltered profile in the protein expression of apoptotic molecules PARP, procaspase 3 and Bax was detected, while the p53 protein was decreased. Results of RT-PCR analysis showed decrease of p53 mRNA level and no significant difference in Bcl-2 and Bax mRNA expressions in DEX-treated rats. Finally, the DNA fragmentation assay and Fluoro-Jade staining demonstrated no considerable changes in the apoptosis in rat PFC. Our findings support the concept that a low-dose DEX creates the hypocorticoid state in the brain and indicate that subchronic DEX treatment activates pro-survival signalling pathway but does not change apoptotic markers in rat PFC. This mechanism might be relevant for DEX-induced apoptosis resistance observed during and after chemotherapy of patients with brain tumours. © 2013 British Society for Neuroendocrinology.
23256719	Antioxidants and mucolytics in COPD management: when (if ever) and in whom?	Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Oxidative stress is an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of this disease. The oxidant/ antioxidant imbalance occurring in smokers and patients with COPD is well established. Thus, therapeutic strategies targeting oxidative stress with pharmacological antioxidant agents or boosting the endogenous levels of antioxidants is likely to be beneficial as an adjunctive tool in the treatment of COPD patients. Thiol compounts such as N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), carbocysteine, erdosteine, and fudosteine have been extensively studied. Although some results remain controversial, NAC and carbocysteine seem to have beneficial effect in patients not receiving inhaled corticosteroids who suffer from frequent exacerbations. In addition, other antioxidants like superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetics and nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) are shown to decrease markers of oxidative stress in patients with emphysema, while others like glutathione peroxidase (GPx) mimetics and NO synthase (iNOS) can prevent both inflammation and oxidative stress in clinical trials in vivo (or in mouse models). In this article we review the effectiveness of various antioxidant factors in COPD and their potential beneficial effect in the treatment of the disease.
23462380	Non-front-fanged colubroid snakes: A current evidence-based analysis of medical significance.	"Non-front-fanged colubroid snakes (NFFC; formerly and artificially taxonomically assembled as ""colubrids"") comprise about 70% of extant snake species and include several taxa now known to cause lethal or life threatening envenoming in humans. Although the medical risks of bites by only a handful of species have been documented, a growing number of NFFC are implicated in medically significant bites. The majority of these snakes have oral products (Duvernoy's secretions, or venoms) with unknown biomedical properties and their potential for causing harm in humans is unknown. Increasingly, multiple NFFC species are entering the commercial snake trade posing an uncertain risk. Published case reports describing NFFC bites were assessed for evidence-based value, clinical detail and verified species identification. These data were subjected to meta-analysis and a hazard index was generated for select taxa. Cases on which we consulted or personally treated were included and subjected to the same assessment criteria. Cases involving approximately 120 species met the selection criteria, and a small subset designated Hazard Level 1 (most hazardous), contained 5 species with lethal potential. Recommended management of these cases included antivenom for 3 species, Dispholidus typus, Rhabdophis tiginis, Rhabdophis subminiatus, whereas others in this subset without commercially available antivenoms (Thelotornis spp.) were treated with plasma/erythrocyte replacement therapy and supportive care. Heparin, antifibrinolytics and/or plasmapheresis/exchange transfusion have been used in the management of some Hazard Level 1 envenomings, but evidence-based analysis positively contraindicates the use of any of these interventions. Hazard Level 2/3 species were involved in cases containing mixed quality data that implicated these taxa (e.g. Boiga irregularis, Philodryas olfersii, Malpolon monspessulanus) with bites that caused rare systemic effects. Recommended management may include use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (e.g. neostigmine) and wound care on a case-by-case basis. Hazard level 3 species comprised a larger group capable of producing significant local effects only, often associated with a protracted bite (eg Heterodon nasicus, Borikenophis (Alsophis) portoricensis, Platyceps (Coluber) rhodorachis). Management is restricted to wound care. Bites by Hazard level 4 species comprised the majority of surveyed taxa and these showed only minor effects of no clinical importance. This study has produced a comprehensive evidence-based listing of NFFC snakes tabulated against medical significance of bites, together with best-practice management recommendations. This analysis assumes increasing importance, as there is growing exposure to lesser-known NFFC snakes, particularly in captive collections that may uncover further species of significance in the future. Careful and accurate documentation of bites by verified species of NFFC snakes is required to increase the evidence base and establish the best medical management approach for each species."
23473268	Mechanistic investigation of seeded growth in triblock copolymer stabilized gold nanoparticles.	We report the seeded synthesis of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) via the reduction of HAuCl4 by (L31 and F68) triblock copolymer (TBP) mixtures. In the present study, we focused on [TBP]/[Au(III)] ratios of 1-5 (≈1 mM HAuCl4) and seed sizes ~20 nm. Under these conditions, the GNP growth rate is dominated by both the TBP and seed concentrations. With seeding, the final GNP size distributions are bimodal. Increasing the seed concentration (up to ~0.1 nM) decreases the mean particle sizes 10-fold, from ~1000 to 100 nm. The particles in the bimodal distribution are formed by the competitive direct growth in solution and the aggregative growth on the seeds. By monitoring kinetics of GNP growth, we propose that (1) the surface of the GNP seeds embedded in the TBP cavities form catalytic centers for GNP growth and (2) large GNPs are formed by the aggregation of GNP seeds in an autocatalytic growth process.
23435541	Attenuation by statins of membrane raft-redox signaling in coronary arterial endothelium.	Membrane raft (MR)-redox signaling platforms associated with NADPH oxidase are involved in coronary endothelial dysfunction. Here, we studied whether statins interfere with the formation of MR-redox signaling platforms to protect the coronary arterial endothelium from oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OxLDL)-induced injury and from acute hypercholesterolemia. In cultured human coronary arterial endothelial cells, confocal microscopy detected the formation of an MRs clustering when they were exposed to OxLDL, and such MR platform formation was inhibited markedly by statins, including pravastatin and simvastatin. In these MR clusters, NADPH oxidase subunits gp91(phox) and p47(phox) were aggregated and were markedly blocked by both statins. In addition, colocalization of acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) and ceramide was induced by OxLDL, which was blocked by statins. Electron spin resonance spectrometry showed that OxLDL-induced superoxide (O2(.-)) production in the MR fractions was substantially reduced by statins. In coronary artery intima of mice with acute hypercholesterolemia, confocal microscopy revealed a colocalization of gp91(phox), p47(phox), ASM, or ceramide in MR clusters. Such colocalization was rarely observed in the arteries of normal mice or significantly reduced by pretreatment of hypercholesterolemic mice with statins. Furthermore, O2(.-) production in situ was 3-fold higher in the coronary arteries from hypercholesterolemic mice than in those from normal mice, and such increase was inhibited by statins. Our results indicate that blockade of MR-redox signaling platform formation in endothelial cell membrane may be another important therapeutic mechanism of statins in preventing endothelial injury and atherosclerosis and may be associated with their direct action on membrane cholesterol structure and function.
23219337	Anti-tumor and anti-metastatic actions of wogonin isolated from Scutellaria baicalensis roots through anti-lymphangiogenesis.	Tumor growth and metastasis are associated with angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis through the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or VEGF-C in tumors, and the phosphorylation of VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-2 or VEGFR-3 in vascular endothelial cells or lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play an important role in tumor lymphangiogenesis, and consequently stimulate metastasis through the lymphatic system to lymph nodes. We examined the effects of wogonin isolated from Scutellaria baicalensis roots on tumor growth and metastasis using a highly metastatic model in osteosarcoma LM8-bearing mice. Wogonin (25 and 50 mg/kg, twice daily) reduced tumor growth and metastasis to the lung, liver and kidney, angiogenesis (CD31-positive cells), lymphangiogenesis (LYVE-1-positive cells), and TAM (F4/80-positive cell) numbers in the tumors of LM8-bearing mice. Wogonin (10-100 μM) also inhibited increases in IL-1β production and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression induced by lipopolysaccharide in THP-1 macrophages. Wogonin had no effect on VEGF-C production in LM8 cells, or VEGFR-3 expression in human lymphatic endothelial cells (HLECs), however, it inhibited VEGF-C-induced VEGFR-3 phosphorylation in HLECs. The anti-tumor and anti-metastatic actions of wogonin may be associated with the inhibition of VEGF-C-induced lymphangiogenesis through a reduction in VEGF-C-induced VEGFR-3 phosphorylation by the inhibition of COX-2 expression and IL-1β production in TAMs.
23564646	ALLERGIC SKIN INFLAMMATION INDUCED BY CHEMICAL SENSITIZERS IS CONTROLLED BY THE TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR NRF2.	Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is induced by low molecular weight electrophilic chemicals and metal ions. Chemical contact sensitizers trigger reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and provoke electrophilic stress leading to the accumulation of the transcription factor nuclear related factor 2 (Nrf2) in innate immune cell types. The objective of this work was to identify the role of Nrf2 in the regulation of ACD. We used the Local Lymph Node Assay (LLNA) and the Mouse Ear Swelling Test (MEST) to study the role of Nrf2 in both the sensitization and elicitation phase in nrf2 knock out (nrf2(-/-)) and wild type (nrf2(+/+)) mice. Five chemicals were used: two compounds known to react with cysteine residues, 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) and cinnamaldehyde (CinA); one sensitizer known to exhibit mixed reactivity to cysteine and lysine residues, isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI); and one reacting specifically with lysine residues, trimellitic anhydride (TMA) and croton oil a well-known irritant. In the MEST assay, DNCB (1% and 2%) induced a significant increase in ear thickness in nrf2(-/-) as compared to nrf2(+/+) mice suggesting a role for Nrf2 in the control of the inflammatory process. When DNCB was used at 0.25% and 0.5% or when mice were treated with CinA, inflammation was found only in nrf2(-/-) mice. In the LLNA all chemical sensitizers induced an increase of lymphocyte proliferation in nrf2(-/-) compared to nrf2(+/+) mice for the same chemical concentration.These results reveal an important role for Nrf2 in controlling ACD and lymphocyte proliferation in response to sensitizers.
23543412	Nicotine-Induced Structural Plasticity in Mesencephalic Dopaminergic Neurons Is Mediated by Dopamine D3 Receptors and Akt-mTORC1 Signalling.	"Though long-term exposure to nicotine is highly addictive, one ""beneficial"" consequence of chronic tobacco use is a reduced risk for Parkinson's disease. Interestingly, these effects both reflect structural and functional plasticity of brain circuits controlling reward and motor behavior, and specifically recruitment of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) in mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons. Since the underlying cellular mechanisms are poorly understood, we addressed this issue employing primary cultures of mouse mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons. Exposure to nicotine (1-10 μM) for 72 hr in vitro increased dendritic arborization and soma size in primary cultures. These effects were blocked by mecamylamine and dihydro-β-erythroidine, but not methyllycaconitine. The involvement of α4β2 nAChR was supported by the lack of nicotine-induced structural remodeling in neurons from α4 null mutant mice (KO). Challenge with nicotine triggered phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and the thymoma viral proto-oncogene (Akt) followed by activation of the mTORC1-dependent p70 ribosomal S6 protein kinase. Upstream pathway blockade using the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 resulted in suppression of nicotine-induced phosphorylations and structural plasticity. These effects were dependent upon functional DA D3 receptor (D3R) since nicotine was inactive both in cultures from D3R KO mice and following pharmacologic blockade with D3R antagonist SB-277011-A (50 nM). Finally, exposure to nicotine in utero (5 mg/kg/day for 5 days) resulted in increased soma area of DAergic neurons of newborn mice, effects not observed in D3KO mice. These findings indicate that nicotine-induced structural plasticity in mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons involves α4β2 nAChRs together with dopamine D3R-mediated recruitment of ERK/Akt-mTORC1 signaling."
23194750	Reversible inhibition of vasoconstriction by thiazolidinediones related to PI3K/Akt inhibition in vascular smooth muscle cells.	Thiazolidinediones (also referred to as glitazones), agonists for Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma (PPARγ), are used for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus, where they decrease insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk. Compounds bearing the thiazolidinedione structure have also been shown to inhibit phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Here we tried to elucidate the poorly defined role of PI3K/Akt in the physiology of vascular smooth muscle cell contraction and tested the hypothesis that thiazolidinediones, by affecting the PI3K/Akt pathway, may influence vascular physiology. Isolated rat femoral arteries segments were mounted in a wire myograph and challenged with 100mM KCl or phenylephrine (PE), in the absence or presence of troglitazone, rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor) and 10-DEBC (Akt inhibitor). All these compounds dose-dependently inhibited vasoconstriction to KCl or PE; their effect was reversible (after 60-120 min washout) and not affected by GW9662 (a PPARγ antagonist) or by N(G)-nitro-L-arginine (LNNA, an inhibitor of NO biosynthesis). Analysis of phospho-Akt (ser 473) in lysates from rat arteries (by immunoblot) revealed that thiazolidinediones, LY294002 and 10-DEBC, at the same concentration and kinetics inhibiting vasoconstriction, produced a similar decrease of Akt phosphorylation. PI3K/Akt pathway therefore appears to be an important, fast acting, modulator of contraction of vascular smooth muscle. Thiazolidinediones decrease vasoconstriction of isolated vessels possibly by inhibiting PI3K/Akt pathway. Such an effect of glitazones, if occurring in vivo, may impact cardiovascular syndromes related to vasospasm in diabetic patients.
2994716	Nucleotide sequence of the gene for human factor IX (antihemophilic factor B).	Two different human genomic DNA libraries were screened for the gene for blood coagulation factor IX by employing a cDNA for the human protein as a hybridization probe. Five overlapping lambda phages were identified that contained the gene for factor IX. The complete DNA sequence of about 38 kilobases for the gene and the adjacent 5' and 3' flanking regions was established by the dideoxy chain termination and chemical degradation methods. The gene contained about 33.5 kilobases of DNA, including seven introns and eight exons within the coding and 3' noncoding regions of the gene. The eight exons code for a prepro leader sequence and 415 amino acids that make up the mature protein circulating in plasma. The intervening sequences range in size from 188 to 9473 nucleotides and contain four Alu repetitive sequences, including one in intron A and three in intron F. A fifth Alu repetitive sequence was found immediately flanking the 3' end of the gene. A 50 base pair insert in intron A was found in a clone from one of the genomic libraries but was absent in clones from the other library. Intron A as well as the 3' noncoding region of the gene also contained alternating purine-pyrimidine sequences that provide potential left-handed helical DNA or Z-DNA structures for the gene. KpnI repetitive sequences were identified in intron D and the region flanking the 5' end of the gene. The 5' flanking region also contained a 1.9-kb HindIII subfamily repeat. The seven introns in the gene for factor IX were located in essentially the same position as the seven introns in the gene for human protein C, while the first three were found in positions identical with those in the gene for human prothrombin.
17463062	Corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor type 1 and type 2 mediate differential effects on 15-hydroxy prostaglandin dehydrogenase expression in cultured human chorion trophoblasts.	Throughout gestation, the chorion laeve controls the levels of biologically active prostaglandins (PGs) by its high level of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent 15-hydroxy PG dehydrogenase (PGDH). In this study, we investigate the effects mediated by CRH receptors on the expression of PGDH in the chorion. We found that both CRHR1 and CRHR2 were localized in cultured chorion trophoblast cells, with CRH-R1alpha, R1beta, R1c, R1e, and R1f and CRHR2beta isoforms identified in these cells. To block the actions of endogenous CRH and its related peptides, cultured chorion trophoblasts were treated with an increasing concentration of alpha-helical CRH 9-41, the nonselective CRH receptor antagonist, which resulted in decreased mRNA and protein expression as well as the activity of PGDH. To investigate the individual role of CRHR1 and CRHR2, cell cultures were treated with the specific CRHR1 antagonist antalarmin and CRHR2 antagonist astressin2B, respectively. The results showed that antalarmin increased whereas astressin2B decreased mRNA and protein expression as well as the activity of PGDH in chorion cells. When the cells were treated with an exclusive CRHR2 agonist, urocortin II, elevated expression and activity of PGDH was exhibited. However, cells treated with either exogenous CRH or urocortin I showed significantly increased PGDH expression, and these effects could be blocked by astressin2B but not by antalarmin. We suggest that, in chorion trophoblast cells, CRHR1 and CRHR2 mediate divergent effects on PGDH expression, and this may provide a precise regulation of PGs levels from chorion to myometrium during pregnancy.
19920913	Ambrisentan for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension.	Ambrisentan is an endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) that was recently approved for treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Endothelin (ET) is a potent vasoconstrictor with mitogenic, hypertrophic and pro-inflammatory properties that is upregulated in pulmonary hypertensive diseases. The biologic effects of ET are mediated by 2 cell surface receptors termed ET(A) and ET(B). ET(A) mediates the vasoconstrictor effect of ET on vascular smooth muscle, whereas ET(B) is expressed primarily on vascular endothelial cells where it induces nitric oxide synthesis and acts to clear ET from the circulation. Ambrisentan is the first ET(A) selective ERA approved for use in the US. Recently published clinical trials in patients with PAH demonstrate improvement in functional capacity and pulmonary hemodynamics similar to other ET(A) selective and non-selective ERAs. Its once daily dosing and lower incidence of serum aminotransferase elevation offer potential advantages over other ERAs, but further experience with this agent is needed to fully understand its long-term efficacy and safety. This review discusses the endothelin family of proteins and receptors and their role in the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertensive diseases. It also examines the development process, safety profile and clinical trials that have resulted in ambrisentan being approved for treatment of PAH.
12184062	The clinical profile of the angiotensin II receptor blocker eprosartan.	Angiotensin II receptor antagonists block angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptors and reduce the pressor effects of angiotensin in the vasculature. By this mechanism, they induce similar pharmacological effects to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, resulting in a lowering of blood pressure (BP). However, AT1 antagonists differ from ACE inhibitors with respect to side effects, and induce less cough, which is related to bradykinin activation. Within the class of angiotensin II antagonists, eprosartan differs from other currently clinically available agents in terms of its chemical structure and its dual pharmacological mode of action. Eprosartan acts not only at vascular AT1 receptors but also at presynaptic AT1 receptors, causing inhibition of sympathetically stimulated noradrenaline release. Eprosartan is not metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes and therefore has a low potential for metabolic drug interactions, which may be of importance when treating the elderly and patients on multiple drugs. In clinical trials eprosartan has proven to be at least as effective as the ACE inhibitor enalapril in reducing BP, but with a significantly lower incidence of side effects. Eprosartan is safe, effective and well tolerated in long-term treatment, either as monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs such as hydrochlorothiazide.
19690271	The effect of a peripheral block on inflammation-induced prostaglandin E2 and cyclooxygenase expression in rats.	BACKGROUND: Peripheral inflammatory pain is associated with an upregulation of spinal cord COX-2 (cyclooxygenase-2), with a subsequent increase in central prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels associated with the development of hyperalgesia. In this study, we evaluated the effect of bupivacaine administered via a nerve block or via a systemic route on the spinal expression of PGE2 and COX in a model of peripheral inflammation in rats. METHODS: All rats randomly received three injections: 1) a left subcutaneous hindpaw injection (0.2 mL with either carrageenan 2% w/v or saline), 2) a left sciatic block (0.2 mL with either bupivacaine 0.5% or saline), and 3) a systemic injection (subcutaneous interscapular with 0.2 mL with either bupivacaine 0.5% or saline). Local edema, thermal, and mechanical hyperalgesia as well as cerebrospinal fluid PGE2 concentration and COX-1 and COX-2 expression in the spinal cord in dorsal root ganglions were measured. RESULTS: We confirmed that a bupivacaine block attenuates hyperalgesia and local inflammation in a model of inflammatory pain. This effect was associated with an inhibition of the increase in COX-2 expression induced by peripheral inflammation in dorsal root ganglions and cord. The subsequent production of PGE2 in cerebrospinal fluid was also impaired. Systemic bupivacaine did not modify either the hyperalgesia and local inflammation or COX expression. CONCLUSION: These results constitute a key element strongly suggesting that local anesthetics act at a different level when administered systematically or via a nerve block.
23604819	Synthesis, cytotoxicity and QSAR study of N-tosyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives.	1-Substituted-N-tosyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline analogs (4a-4l) were synthesized using the modified Pictet-Spengler reaction and evaluated for cytotoxicity. All tetrahydroisoquinolines displayed cytotoxicity against MOLT-3 cell lines, except for p-methoxy analog 4d. Interestingly, the o-hydroxy derivative 4k was shown to be the most potent cytotoxic against HuCCA-1, A-549 and MOLT-3 cell lines. The lowest IC50 value of 1.23 μM was observed for MOLT-3 cells. Trimethoxy analog 4f exerted the most potent activity against HepG2 with an IC50 of 22.70 μM, which is lower than the reference drug, etoposide. QSAR studies showed that total symmetry index (Gu), 3D-MoRSE (Mor31v and Mor32u) and 3D Petitjean index (PJI3) were the most important descriptors accounting for the observed cytotoxicities. The most potent cytotoxic compound (4k) against MOLT-3 had the highest Gu value, correspondingly the inactive p-methoxy analog (4d) had the lowest Gu value. On the other hand, the highest molecular mass compound (4f) was shown to be the most potent cytotoxic against HepG2 cells. The studies disclose that tetrahydroisoquinolines 4f and 4k are potentially interesting lead pharmacophores that should be further explored. The QSAR models provided insights into the physicochemical properties of the investigated compounds.
23261705	Stimulatory effect of insulin on theca-interstitial cell proliferation and cell cycle regulatory proteins through MTORC1 dependent pathway.	The present study examined the effect of insulin-mediated activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (MTORC1) signaling network on the proliferation of primary culture of theca-interstitial (T-I) cells. Our results show that insulin treatment increased proliferation of the T-I cells through the MTORC1-dependent signaling pathway by increasing cell cycle regulatory proteins. Inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling caused partial reduction of insulin-induced phosphorylation of RPS6KB1 and RPS6 whereas inhibition of PI3-kinase signaling completely blocked the insulin response. Pharmacological inhibition of MTORC1 with rapamycin abrogated the insulin-induced phosphorylation of EIF4EBP1, RPS6KB1 and its downstream effector, RPS6. These results were further confirmed by demonstrating that knockdown of Mtor using siRNA reduced the insulin-stimulated MTORC1 signaling. Furthermore, insulin-stimulated T-I cell proliferation and the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins CDK4, CCND3 and PCNA were also blocked by rapamycin. Taken together, the present studies show that insulin stimulates cell proliferation and cell cycle regulatory proteins in T-I cells via activation of the MTORC1 signaling pathway.
12110374	Dopamine D(2) receptor-induced COX-2-mediated production of prostaglandin E(2) in D(2)-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells without simultaneous administration of a Ca(2+)-mobilizing agent.	We have earlier demonstrated that dopamine stimulates the liberation of the prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) precursor, arachidonic acid, in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the rat dopamine D(2) receptor (long isoform), also without concomitant administration of a Ca(2+)-releasing agent [Nilsson et al., Br J Pharmacol 1998;124:1651-8]. In the present report, we show that dopamine, under the same conditions, also induces a concentration-dependent increase in the production of PGE(2), with a maximal effect of 235% at approximately 100 microM, and with an EC(50) of 794 nM. The effect was counteracted by the D(2) antagonist eticlopride, pertussis toxin, the inhibitor of intracellular Ca(2+) release TMB-8, incubation in Ca(2+)-free experimental medium, and PKC desensitization obtained by chronic pretreatment with the phorbol ester TPA. It was also antagonized by the non-specific cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, indomethacin, and by the selective COX-2 inhibitor, NS-398, but not by the specific COX-1 inhibitor, valeryl salicylate. Both the non-specific phospholipase A(2) inhibitor, quinacrine, and an inhibitor of cPLA(2) and iPLA(2), AACOF3, counteracted the effect; in contrast, a selective iPLA(2) inhibitor, BEL, and a selective sPLA(2) inhibitor, TAPC, were ineffective. No effects of dopamine were obtained in control cells mock-transfected with the p3C vector only. The results reinforce previous assumptions that dopamine may interact with eicosanoid metabolism by means of D(2) receptor activation, and implicate an involvement of cPLA(2) and COX-2 in this effect. It is suggested that measurement of dopamine-induced PGE(2) production may serve as a convenient way to study D(2) receptor function in vitro.
20427668	Rapid glucocorticoid receptor-mediated inhibition of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ultradian activity in healthy males.	A complex dynamic ultradian rhythm underlies the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) circadian rhythm. We have investigated in normal human male subjects the importance, site of action, and receptor-mediated processes involved in rapid basal corticosteroid feedback and its interaction with corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) drive. Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), ACTH, and cortisol were measured every 10 min from healthy males during the awakening period or late afternoon using an automated blood sampling system. Mathematical modeling into discrete pulses of activity revealed that intravenous infusion of the synthetic mixed glucocorticoid/mineralocorticoid agonist prednisolone produced rapid inhibition of ACTH and cortisol pulsatility within 30 min in the morning and afternoon. Any pulse that had commenced at the time of injection was unaffected, and subsequent pulsatility was inhibited. Prednisolone also inhibited ACTH and cortisol secretion in response to exogenous CRH stimulation, inferring rapid feedback inhibition at the anterior pituitary. Circulating POMC peptide concentrations were unaffected, suggesting that the rapid corticosteroid inhibitory effect specifically targeted ACTH secretion from pituitary corticotrophs. Prednisolone fast feedback was only reduced by glucocorticoid receptor antagonist pretreatment and not by mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism, suggesting a glucocorticoid receptor-mediated pathway. The intravenous prednisolone suppression test provides a powerful new tool to investigate HPA abnormalities underlying metabolic and psychiatric disease states.
16425993	Sorafenib: scientific rationales for single-agent and combination therapy in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma.	Clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is characterized by the loss of von Hippel-Lindau disease protein and the resultant dysregulation of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor (VEGFR), platelet-derived growth factor-beta (PDGF-beta)/PDGF receptor-beta (PDGFR-beta), and transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha)/epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/Raf pathways, which contribute to angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, and tumor cell growth and survival. Significant advances in the treatment of clear-cell RCC have been derived from agents that target these pathways, including the multiple-kinase inhibitors (MKIs) sorafenib, sunitinib, and AG013736, which target multiple VEGFRs as well as PDGFR-beta. Sorafenib has the added advantage of inhibiting multiple different Raf isoforms, which enables it to target TGF-alpha/EGFR signaling and may also enhance its inhibition of VEGFR and PDGFR-beta. This review will examine the recent advances in our understanding of the biology of clear-cell RCC and show how those advances have helped delineate new targets of opportunity for treatment. It will also present the early clinical results of agents that target the pathways dysregulated in clear-cell RCC, with special emphasis on sorafenib and the other active MKIs, and will describe the scientific rationales for ongoing and future sorafenib-based combination therapy trials in RCC.
11544332	Urokinase plasminogen activator and plasmin efficiently convert hemofiltrate CC chemokine 1 into its active.	We have previously isolated from human hemofiltrate an N-terminally truncated form of the hemofiltrate CC chemokine 1 (HCC-1), and characterized HCC-1[9-74] as a strong agonist of CCR1, CCR5, and to a lower extent CCR3. In this study, we show that conditioned media from human tumor cell lines PC-3 and 143B contain proteolytic activities that convert HCC-1 into the [9-74] form. This activity was fully inhibited by inhibitors of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), including PA inhibitor-1, an anti-uPA mAb, and amiloride. Pure preparations of uPA processed HCC-1 with high efficiency, without further degrading HCC-1[9-74]. Plasmin could also generate HCC-1[9-74], but degraded the active product as well. The kinetics of HCC-1 cleavage by uPA and plasmin (Michaelis constant, K(m), of 0.76 +/- 0.4 microM for uPA, and 0.096 +/- 0.05 microM for plasmin; catalytic rate constant, k(cat): 3.36 +/- 0.96 s(-1) for uPA and 6 +/- 3.6 s(-1) for plasmin) are fully compatible with a role in vivo. The activation of an abundant inactive precursor into a broad-spectrum chemokine by uPA and plasmin directly links the production of uPA by numerous tumors and their ability to recruit mononuclear leukocytes, without the need for the transcriptional activation of chemokine genes.
11772142	Rabeprazole: an update of its use in acid-related disorders.	UNLABELLED: Rabeprazole is an inhibitor of the gastric proton pump. It causes dose-dependent inhibition of acid secretion. In 8-week studies, among patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), rabeprazole 20 mg/day or 10mg twice daily was as effective as omeprazole and superior to ranitidine in the healing of GORD. Symptom relief with rabeprazole was superior to that provided by placebo and ranitidine and similar to omeprazole. In long-term trials rabeprazole 10 mg/day was similar to omeprazole 20 mg/day in a 2-year study and superior to placebo in 1-year studies, in both the maintenance of healing and prevention of symptoms in patients with healed GORD. In nonerosive GORD, 4-week studies have shown rabeprazole to be more effective than placebo in relieving heartburn and various other gastrointestinal symptoms. Data among patients with Barrett's oesophagus suggest rabeprazole 20 mg/day may be more effective than placebo in maintaining healing of associated oesophagitis after 1 year of treatment. One-week triple Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy with rabeprazole plus clarithromycin and amoxicillin achieved eradication rates of > or =85%. Rabeprazole is as effective as omeprazole and lansoprazole when included as part of a triple-therapy regimen for the eradication of H. pylori. Eradication rates of >90% were achieved when rabeprazole 20 to 40 mg/day was included as part of a quadruple eradication regimen. As monotherapy for peptic ulcer healing and symptom relief, 4- to 8-week studies have shown rabeprazole 10 to 40 mg/day to be superior to placebo and ranitidine and have similar efficacy to omeprazole. Preliminary 1-year data among 16 patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome suggest rabeprazole 60 to 120 mg/day can resolve and prevent the recurrence of symptoms and endoscopic lesions associated with this condition. In clinical trials of up to 2 years' duration the tolerability of rabeprazole is similar to that of placebo, ranitidine and omeprazole. Common adverse events assigned to rabeprazole have been diarrhoea, headache, rhinitis, nausea, pharyngitis and abdominal pain. Histological changes and increases in serum gastrin levels were unremarkable and typical of proton pump inhibitors. No dosage adjustment is necessary in renal and mild to moderate hepatic impairment. CONCLUSION: Rabeprazole is a well tolerated proton pump inhibitor. It has proven efficacy in healing, symptom relief and prevention of relapse of peptic ulcers and GORD and can form part of effective H. pylori eradication regimens. It is an important alternative to H(2) antagonists and an additional treatment option to other proton pump inhibitors in the management of acid-related disorders.
20371872	A dilated cardiomyopathy troponin C mutation lowers contractile force by reducing strong myosin-actin binding.	In this study we explore the mechanisms by which a double mutation (E59D/D75Y) in cardiac troponin C (CTnC) associated with dilated cardiomyopathy reduces the Ca(2+)-activated maximal tension of cardiac muscle. Studying the single mutants (i.e. E59D or D75Y) indicates that D75Y, but not E59D, causes a reduction in the calcium affinity of CTnC in troponin complex, regulated thin filaments (RTF), and the Ca(2+) sensitivity of contraction and ATPase in cardiac muscle preparations. However, both D75Y and E59D are required to reduce the actomyosin ATPase activity and maximal force in muscle fibers, indicating that E59D enhances the effects of D75Y. Part of the reduction in force/ATPase may be due to a defect in the interactions between CTnC and cardiac troponin T, which are known to be necessary for ATPase activation. An additional mechanism for the reduction in force/ATPase comes from measurements of the binding stoichiometry of myosin subfragment-1 (S-1) to the RTF. Using wild type RTFs, 4.8 mol S-1 was bound per mol filament (seven actins), whereas with E59D/D75Y RTFs, the number of binding sites was reduced by approximately 23% to 3.7. Altogether, these results suggest that the reduction in force and ATPase activation is possibly due to a thin filament conformation that promotes fewer accessible S-1-binding sites. In the absence of any family segregation data, the functional results presented here support the concept that this is likely a dilated cardiomyopathy-causing mutation.
23399323	Inhibition of ghrelin O-acyltransferase attenuates food deprivation-induced increases in ingestive behavior.	Ghrelin is an orexigenic hormone produced by the stomach in direct proportion to the time since the last meal and has therefore been called a 'hunger signal'. The octanoylation of ghrelin is critical for its orexigenic functions and is dependent upon ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT) catalyzation. The GOAT inhibitor, GO-CoA-Tat, decreases the circulating concentrations of octanoylated ghrelin and attenuates weight gain on a high fat diet in mice. Unlike rats and mice, Siberian hamsters and humans do not increase food intake after food deprivation, but increase food hoarding after food deprivation. In Siberian hamsters, exogenous ghrelin increases ingestive behaviors similarly to 48-56h food deprivation. Therefore, we tested the necessity of increased ghrelin in food-deprived Siberian hamsters to stimulate ingestive behaviors. To do so we used our simulated natural housing system that allows hamsters to forage for and hoard food. Animals were given an injection of GO-CoA-Tat (i.p., 11μmol/kg) every 6h because that is the duration of its effective inhibition of octanoylated ghrelin concentrations during a 48h food deprivation. We found that GO-CoA-Tat attenuated food foraging (0-1h), food intake (0-1 and 2-4h), and food hoarding (0-1h and 2 and 3days) post-refeeding compared with saline treated animals. This suggests that increased octanoylated ghrelin concentrations play a role in the food deprivation-induced increases in ingestive behavior. Therefore, ghrelin is a critical aspect of the multi-faceted mechanisms that stimulate ingestive behaviors, and might be a critical point for a successful clinical intervention scheme in humans.
16525583	The ability of different forms of heparins to suppress P-selectin function in vitro correlates to their inhibitory capacity on bloodborne metastasis in vivo.	Ample evidence suggests that many of the in vivo anti-metastatic effects by heparins reflect their actions on P-selectin-mediated binding. We hypothesized that the ability of widely used heparins and derivatives to interfere with P-selectin-dependent tumour cell interactions under flow in vitro could be used to identify anticoagulants with advanced inhibitory functions on experimental blood-borne metastasis in vivo. To test this assumption, the impact of unfractionated heparin, the low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) nadroparin and enoxaparin, and the synthetic pentasaccharide fondaparinux on P-selectin-dependent tumour interactions in vitro and metastasis formation in vivo were evaluated. Our data revealed that these commonly used anticoagulants widely differ in their potential to interfere with P-selectinmediated cell binding. Importantly, the superior inhibitory capacity on P-selectin function of unfractionated heparin and LMWH nadroparin as opposed to LMWH enoxaparin and synthetic heparin pentasaccharide fondaparinux strongly correlated to the inhibitory potency of each in inhibiting experimental lung metastasis in vivo. Hence, P-selectin inhibition may constitute a valuable feature to identify anticoagulants that are suitable for anticancer therapy.
23427088	In vivo overexpression of tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase increases skeletal mineralization and affects the phosphorylation status of osteopontin.	Functional ablation of tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) (Alpl(-/-) mice) leads to hypophosphatasia, characterized by rickets/osteomalacia attributable to elevated levels of extracellular inorganic pyrophosphate, a potent mineralization inhibitor. Osteopontin (OPN) is also elevated in the plasma and skeleton of Alpl(-/-) mice. Phosphorylated OPN is known to inhibit mineralization, however, the phosphorylation status of the increased OPN found in Alpl(-/-) mice is unknown. Here, we generated a transgenic mouse line expressing human TNAP under control of an osteoblast-specific Col1a1 promoter (Col1a1-Tnap). The transgene is expressed in osteoblasts, periosteum, and cortical bones, and plasma levels of TNAP in mice expressing Col1a1-Tnap are 10-20 times higher than those of wild-type mice. The Col1a1-Tnap animals are healthy and exhibit increased bone mineralization by microCT analysis. Crossbreeding of Col1a1-Tnap transgenic mice to Alpl(-/-) mice rescues the lethal hypophosphatasia phenotype characteristic of this disease model. Osteoblasts from [Col1a1-Tnap] mice mineralize better than non-transgenic controls and osteoblasts from [Col1a1-Tnap(+/-) ; Alpl(-/-) ] mice are able to mineralize to the level of Alpl(+/-) heterozygous osteoblasts, while Alpl(-/-) osteoblasts show no mineralization. We found that the increased levels of OPN in bone tissue of Alpl(-/-) mice are comprised of phosphorylated forms of OPN while WT and [Col1a1-Tnap(+/-) ; Alpl(-/-) ] mice had both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of OPN. OPN from [Col1a1-Tnap] osteoblasts were more phosphorylated than non-transgenic control cells. Titanium dioxide-liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry analysis revealed that OPN peptides derived from Alpl(-/-) bone and osteoblasts yielded a higher proportion of phosphorylated peptides than samples from WT mice, and at least two phosphopeptides, p(S(174) FQVS(178) DEQY(182) PDAT(186) DEDLT(191) )SHMK and FRIp(S(299) HELES(304) S(305) S(306) S(307) )EVN, with one non-localized site each, appear to be preferred sites of TNAP action on OPN. Our data suggest that the pro-mineralization role of TNAP may be related not only to its accepted pyrophosphatase activity but also to its ability to modify the phosphorylation status of OPN. © 2013 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.
19822896	Nilotinib for the frontline treatment of Ph(+) chronic myeloid leukemia.	Nilotinib has a higher binding affinity and selectivity for BCR-ABL with respect to imatinib and is an effective treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) after imatinib failure. In a phase 2 study, 73 early chronic-phase, untreated, Ph(+) CML patients, received nilotinib at a dose of 400 mg twice daily. The primary endpoint was the complete cytogenetic response (CCgR) rate at 1 year. With a median follow-up of 15 months, the CCgR rate at 1 year was 96%, and the major molecular response rate 85%. Responses were rapid, with 78% CCgR and 52% major molecular response at 3 months. During the first year, the treatment was interrupted at least once in 38 patients (52%). The mean daily dose ranged between 600 and 800 mg in 74% of patients, 400 and 599 mg in 18% of patients, and was less than 400 mg in 8% of patients. Dose interruptions were mainly due to nonhematologic and biochemical side effects. Myelosuppression was irrelevant. One patient progressed to blastic crisis after 6 months; one went off-treatment for lipase increase grade 4 (no pancreatitis). Nilotinib is safe and very active in early chronic-phase CML. These data support a role for nilotinib for the frontline treatment of CML. This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT00481052.
23394205	Discovery of 4-{4-[(3R)-3-Methylmorpholin-4-yl]-6-[1-(methylsulfonyl)cyclopropyl]pyrimidin-2-yl}-1H-indole (AZ20): a potent and selective inhibitor of ATR protein kinase with monotherapy in vivo antitumor activity.	ATR is an attractive new anticancer drug target whose inhibitors have potential as chemo- or radiation sensitizers or as monotherapy in tumors addicted to particular DNA-repair pathways. We describe the discovery and synthesis of a series of sulfonylmorpholinopyrimidines that show potent and selective ATR inhibition. Optimization from a high quality screening hit within tight SAR space led to compound 6 (AZ20) which inhibits ATR immunoprecipitated from HeLa nuclear extracts with an IC50 of 5 nM and ATR mediated phosphorylation of Chk1 in HT29 colorectal adenocarcinoma tumor cells with an IC50 of 50 nM. Compound 6 potently inhibits the growth of LoVo colorectal adenocarcinoma tumor cells in vitro and has high free exposure in mouse following moderate oral doses. At well tolerated doses 6 leads to significant growth inhibition of LoVo xenografts grown in nude mice. Compound 6 is a useful compound to explore ATR pharmacology in vivo.
11212269	Glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-2 reduces chemotherapy-associated mortality and enhances cell survival in cells expressing a transfected GLP-2 receptor.	Chemotherapeutic agents produce cytotoxicity via induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Rapidly proliferating cells in the bone marrow and intestinal crypts are highly susceptible to chemotherapy, and damage to these cellular compartments may preclude maximally effective chemotherapy administration. Glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-2 is an enteroendocrine-derived regulatory peptide that inhibits crypt cell apoptosis after administration of agents that damage the intestinal epithelium. We report here that a human degradation-resistant GLP-2 analogue, h[Gly2]-GLP-2 significantly improves survival, reduces bacteremia, attenuates epithelial injury, and inhibits crypt apoptosis in the murine gastrointestinal tract after administration of topoisomerase I inhibitor irinotecan hydrochloride or the antimetabolite 5-fluorouracil. h[Gly2]-GLP-2 significantly improved survival and reduced weight loss but did not impair chemotherapy effectiveness in tumor-bearing mice treated with cyclical irinotecan. Furthermore, h[Gly2]-GLP-2 reduced chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, decreased activation of caspase-8 and -3, and inhibited poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage in heterologous cells transfected with the GLP-2 receptor. These observations demonstrate that the antiapoptotic effects of GLP-2 on intestinal crypt cells may be useful for the attenuation of chemotherapy-induced intestinal mucositis.
19651196	Medical treatment of acute poisoning with organophosphorus and carbamate pesticides.	Organophosphorus compounds (OPs) are used as pesticides and developed as warfare nerve agents such as tabun, soman, sarin, VX and others. Exposure to even small amounts of an OP can be fatal and death is usually caused by respiratory failure. The mechanism of OP poisoning involves inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) leading to inactivation of the enzyme which has an important role in neurotransmission. AChE inhibition results in the accumulation of acetylcholine at cholinergic receptor sites, producing continuous stimulation of cholinergic fibers throughout the nervous systems. During more than five decades, pyridinium oximes have been developed as therapeutic agents used in the medical treatment of poisoning with OP. They act by reactivation of AChE inhibited by OP. However, they differ in their activity in poisoning with pesticides and warfare nerve agents and there is still no universal broad-spectrum oxime capable of protecting against all known OP. In spite of enormous efforts devoted to development of new pyridinium oximes as potential antidotes against poisoning with OP only four compounds so far have found its application in human medicine. Presently, a combination of an antimuscarinic agent, e.g. atropine, AChE reactivator such as one of the recommended pyridinium oximes (pralidoxime, trimedoxime, obidoxime and HI-6) and diazepam are used for the treatment of OP poisoning in humans. In this article the available data related to medical treatment of poisoning with OP pesticides are reviewed and the current recommendations are presented.
22537794	R-modafinil (armodafinil): a unique dopamine uptake inhibitor and potential medication for psychostimulant abuse.	BACKGROUND: (+/-)-Modafinil has piqued interest as a treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and stimulant dependence. The R-enantiomer of modafinil might have unique pharmacological properties that should be further investigated. METHODS: (+/-)-Modafinil and its R-(-)- and S-(+)-enantiomers were synthesized and tested for inhibition of [(3)H] dopamine (DA) uptake and [(3)H]WIN 35428 binding in human dopamine transporter (DAT) wild-type and mutants with altered conformational equilibria. Data were compared with cocaine and the atypical DA uptake inhibitor, JHW 007. R- and S-modafinil were also evaluated in microdialysis studies in the mouse nucleus accumbens shell and in a cocaine discrimination procedure. RESULTS: (+/-)-, R-, and S-modafinil bind to the DAT and inhibit DA uptake less potently than cocaine, with R-modafinil having approximately threefold higher affinity than its S-enantiomer. Molecular docking studies revealed subtle differences in binding modes for the enantiomers. R-modafinil was significantly less potent in the DAT Y156F mutant compared with wild-type DAT, whereas S-modafinil was affected less. Studies with the Y335A DAT mutant showed that the R- and S-enantiomers tolerated the inward-facing conformation better than cocaine, which was further supported by [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]-methanethiosulfonate reactivity on the DAT E2C I159C. Microdialysis studies demonstrated that both R- and S-modafinil produced increases in extracellular DA concentrations in the nucleus accumbens shell less efficaciously than cocaine and with a longer duration of action. Both enantiomers fully substituted in mice trained to discriminate cocaine from saline. CONCLUSIONS: R-modafinil displays an in vitro profile different from cocaine. Future trials with R-modafinil as a substitute therapy with the potential benefit of cognitive enhancement for psychostimulant addiction are warranted.
17567713	Artificial sweeteners and salts producing a metallic taste sensation activate TRPV1 receptors.	Throughout the world many people use artificial sweeteners (AS) for the purpose of reducing caloric intake. The most prominently used of these molecules include saccharin, aspartame (Nutrasweet), acesulfame-K, and cyclamate. Despite the caloric advantage they provide, one key concern in their use is their aversive aftertaste that has been characterized on a sensory level as bitter and/or metallic. Recently, it has been shown that the activation of particular T2R bitter taste receptors is partially involved with the bitter aftertaste sensation of saccharin and acesulfame-K. To more fully understand the biology behind these phenomena we have addressed the question of whether AS could stimulate transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) receptors, as these receptors are activated by a large range of structurally different chemicals. Moreover, TRPV1 receptors and/or their variants are found in taste receptor cells and in nerve terminals throughout the oral cavity. Hence, TRPV1 activation could be involved in the AS aftertaste or even contribute to the poorly understood metallic taste sensation. Using Ca(2+) imaging on TRPV1 receptors heterologously expressed in the human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and on dissociated primary sensory neurons, we find that in both systems, AS activate TRPV1 receptors, and, moreover, they sensitize these channels to acid and heat. We also found that TRPV1 receptors are activated by CuSO(4), ZnSO(4), and FeSO(4), three salts known to produce a metallic taste sensation. In summary, our results identify a novel group of compounds that activate TRPV1 and, consequently, provide a molecular mechanism that may account for off tastes of sweeteners and metallic tasting salts.
23277230	Fisetin averts oxidative stress in pancreatic tissues of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.	Persistent hyperglycemia is associated with chronic oxidative stress which contributes to the development and progression of diabetes-associated complications. The sensitivity of pancreatic β-cells to oxidative stress has been attributed to their low content of antioxidants compared with other tissues. Bioactive compounds with potent antidiabetic properties have been shown to ameliorate hyperglycemia mediated oxidative stress. Recently, we have reported that oral administration of fisetin (10 mg/Kg b.w.), a bioflavonoid found to be present in strawberries, persimmon, to STZ-induced experimental diabetic rats significantly improved normoglycemia. The present study was aimed to evaluate the antioxidant potential of fisetin in both in vitro and in vivo. Diabetes was induced by single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (50 mg/kg body weight). Fisetin was administered orally for 30 days. At the end of the study, all animals were killed. Blood samples were collected for the biochemical estimations. The antioxidant status was evaluated. Histological examinations were performed on pancreatic tissues. Fisetin treatment showed a significant decline in the levels of blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), NF-kB p65 unit (in pancreas) and IL-1β (plasma), serum nitric oxide (NO) with an elevation in plasma insulin. The treatment also improved the antioxidant status in pancreas as well as plasma of diabetic rats indicating the antioxidant potential of fisetin. In addition, the results of DPPH and ABTS assays substantiate the free radical scavenging activity of fisetin. Histological studies of the pancreas also evidenced the tissue protective nature of fisetin. It is concluded that, fisetin possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory property and may be considered as an adjunct for the treatment of diabetes.
15557593	"A multitargeted, metronomic, and maximum-tolerated dose ""chemo-switch"" regimen is antiangiogenic, producing objective responses and survival benefit in a mouse model of cancer."	"PURPOSE: A transgenic mouse model has revealed parameters of the angiogenic switch during multistep tumorigenesis of pancreatic islets, and demonstrated efficacy of antiangiogenic therapies. Pericytes have been revealed as functionally important for tumor neovasculature, using kinase inhibitors targeting their platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs). Additionally, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitors and metronomic chemotherapy show modest benefit against early- but not late-stage disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seeking to improve efficacy against otherwise intractable end-stage pancreatic islet tumors, two receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, imatinib and SU11248, were used to disrupt PDGFR-mediated pericyte support of tumor endothelial cells in concert with maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) or metronomic chemotherapy and/or VEGFR inhibition. RESULTS: Imatinib, despite equivocal efficacy as monotherapy, reduced pericyte coverage of tumor vessels and enhanced efficacy in combination with metronomic chemotherapy or VEGFR inhibition. A regimen involving all three was even better. MTD using cyclophosphamide caused transitory regression, but then rapid regrowth, in contrast to metronomic cyclophosphamide plus imatinib, which produced stable disease. The MTD regimen elicited apoptosis of tumor cells but not endothelial cells, whereas the other regimens increased endothelial cell apoptosis concordant with efficacy. A ""chemo-switch"" protocol, involving sequential MTD and then metronomic chemotherapy, overlaid with multitargeted inhibition of PDGFR and VEGFR, gave complete responses and unprecedented survival advantage in this model. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a potentially tractable clinical strategy in a stringent preclinical model, wherein standard-of-care chemotherapy is followed by a novel maintenance regimen: PDFGR is targeted to disrupt pericyte support, while metronomic chemotherapy and/or VEGFR inhibitors target consequently sensitized endothelial cells, collectively destabilizing pre-existing tumor vasculature and inhibiting ongoing angiogenesis."
15627430	The role of muscarinic receptor antagonism in antipsychotic-induced hippocampal acetylcholine release.	Olanzapine and clozapine produce robust increases in hippocampal acetylcholine release during acetylcholinesterase inhibition, while other antipsychotics, including thioridazine, have only small effects. Since thioridazine binds with similar high affinities to muscarinic receptors as olanzapine and clozapine, muscarinic autoreceptor blockade was ruled out as a primary mechanism [Neuropsychopharmacology 26 (2002) 583]. This study compared in vitro binding affinities and functional activities of olanzapine, clozapine, thioridazine, ziprasidone, risperidone, chlorpromazine and scopolamine at muscarinic M2 receptors with their in vivo potencies to increase acetylcholine release in the rat hippocampus. We found that scopolamine, olanzapine and clozapine, but also high doses of thioridazine and chlorpromazine, markedly increase acetylcholine release. The reduced in vivo potencies of thioridazine and chlorpromazine are consistent with their significantly weaker functional antagonist activity at human muscarinic M2 receptors, while thioridazine's reduced binding affinity for rat muscarinic M2 receptors and lower brain exposure, may further contribute to its weak in vivo potency compared to olanzapine. The excellent correlation between in vitro antagonist activities of antipsychotics at muscarinic M2 receptors and their in vivo potencies to increase acetylcholine release, suggests that olanzapine, clozapine, as well as thioridazine and chlorpromazine, increase acetylcholine release via blockade of terminal muscarinic M2 autoreceptors.
23249626	An engineered human follistatin variant: insights into the pharmacokinetic and pharmocodynamic relationships of a novel molecule with broad therapeutic potential.	Human follistatin is a regulatory glycoprotein with widespread biologic functions, including antiinflammatory activities, wound-healing properties, and muscle-stimulating effects. The role of follistatin in a wide range of biologic activities shows promise for potential clinical application, which has prompted considerable interest in the investigation of the protein as a potential disease-modifying agent. In spite of this potential, the development of follistatin as a broad use biotherapeutic has been severely hindered by a poor understanding and characterization of its pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships. Therefore, to better define these relationships, we performed in-depth analyses of the PK/PD relationships of native follistatin-315 (FST315). Our data indicate that the intrinsic PK/PD properties of native FST315 are poorly suited for acting as a parentally administered biotherapeutic with broad systemic effects. Here, we leveraged protein engineering to modify the PK characteristics of the native molecule by fusing FST315 to a murine IgG(1) Fc and removing the intrinsic heparan sulfate-binding activity of follistatin. The engineered variant molecule had ~100- and ~1600-fold improvements in terminal half-life and exposure, respectively. In contrast to the native FST315, the variant showed a robust, dose-dependent pharmacological effect when administered subcutaneously on a weekly basis in mouse models of muscle atrophy and degeneration. These studies highlight the underappreciated and critical relationship between optimizing multiple physical and chemical properties of follistatin on its overall PK/PD profile. Moreover, our findings provide the first documented strategy toward the development of a follistatin therapeutic with potential use in patients affected with skeletal muscle diseases.
11304699	Distal bowel selectivity in the chemoprevention of experimental colon carcinogenesis by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug nabumetone.	Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for chemoprevention of colon cancer has been hindered by their potential gastro-intestinal toxicity. Nabumetone, which is approximately 10 to 36 times safer than conventional NSAIDs, was evaluated in 2 models of experimental colon carcinogenesis. In azoxymethane (AOM)-treated Fisher 344 rats, nabumetone caused dose-dependent inhibition of aberrant crypt foci (ACF), with 750 and 1,500 ppm resulting in 15% and 37% reductions, respectively (p < 0.05). Moreover, complex ACF were reduced by 48% in the latter group. MIN mice studies confirmed the chemopreventive efficacy of nabumetone, with 900 ppm suppressing approximately half of the intestinal tumors. Interestingly, inhibition of intermediate biomarkers in both models was markedly greater in the distal than the proximal bowel. To mechanistically evaluate this regional selectivity, we assessed cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in the uninvolved mucosa and demonstrated a 3- to 4-fold excess in the distal relative to the proximal bowel in both MIN mice and AOM-treated rats. We then investigated another putative NSAID target, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-delta (PPAR-delta) and demonstrated up-regulation during AOM-induced colonic tumorigenesis. Furthermore, in pre-neoplastic mucosa, there was a 3-fold excess of PPAR-delta in the distal colon. We demonstrate that nabumetone is an effective protective agent in both experimental models of colon carcinogenesis. The striking distal predilection of nabumetone may be, at least partially, explained by distal bowel over-expression of COX-2 and PPAR-delta.
23484668	Diarylheptanoids and Flavonoids from Viscum album Inhibit LPS-Stimulated Production of Pro-inflammatory Cytokines in Bone Marrow-Derived Dendritic Cells.	Three new diarylheptanoids, (3S,5R)-3-hydroxy-5-methoxy-1,7-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-6E-heptene (1), (3S,5S)-3-hydroxy-5-methoxy-1,7-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-6E-heptene (2), and (3S)-3-hydroxy-1,7-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-6E-hepten-5-one (3), four new flavonoid glycosides, 3,7,3'-tri-O-methylquercetin-4'-O-β-d-apiofuranosyl-(1→2)-O-β-d-glucopyranoside (4), 7,3'-di-O-methylquercetin-4'-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-3-O-[6‴-(3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaroyl)]-α-d-glucopyranoside (5), 7,3'-di-O-methylquercetin-4'-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-3-O-[(6'''''→5'''')-O-1'''''-(sinap-4-yl)-β-d-glucopyranosyl-6‴-(3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaroyl)]-α-d-glucopyranoside (6), and (2S)-5-hydroxy-7,3'-dimethoxyflavanone-4'-O-β-d-apiofuranosyl-(1→5)-O-β-d-apiofuranosyl-(1→2)-O-β-d-glucopyranoside (9), and 17 known compounds were isolated from the leaves and twigs of Viscum album. Compounds 1, 4, and 19 significantly inhibited LPS-stimulated production of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-12p40 with IC50 values ranging from 0.09 ± 0.01 to 8.96 ± 0.45 μM. (+)-Medioresinol (13) showed inhibitory effects on LPS-stimulated production of IL-12p40 with an IC50 value of 2.00 ± 0.15 μM.
17486443	Fluoxetine partly exerts its actions through GABA: a neurochemical evidence.	Fluoxetine, as a serotonin re-uptake inhibitor augments serotonin concentration within the synapse by inhibiting the serotonin transporter. The contribution of amino acids has also been shown in depression. We hypothesized that fluoxetine exerts its actions at least in part by intervening brain signaling operated by amino acid transmitters. Therefore the aim of this study is to supply neurochemical evidence that fluoxetine produces changes in amino acids in cerebrospinal fluid of rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized and concentric microdialysis probes were implanted stereotaxically into the right lateral ventricle. Intraperitoneal fluoxetine (2.5 or 5 mg/kg) or physiological saline was administered and the probes were perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid at a rate of 1 mul/min. In the chronic fluoxetine group, the rats were treated daily with oral fluoxetine solution or inert syrup for 3 weeks. The microdialysis probes were placed on the 21st day and perfused the next day. Fluoxetine was ineffective in changing the cerebrospinal fluid GABA levels at the dose of 2.5 mg/kg but produced a significant increase in the perfusates following injection of 5 mg/kg of fluoxetine (P < 0.05). Oral fluoxetine administration (5 mg/kg) for 21 days also elevated the CSF GABA levels by approximately 2-fold (P < 0.05). L: -glutamic acid levels were not affected in all groups. These neurochemical findings show that fluoxetine, a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor affects brain GABA levels indirectly, and our results suggest that acute or chronic effects may be involved in beneficial and/or adverse effects of the drug.
23142599	Inhibition of vitellogenin gene induction by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin is mediated by aryl hydrocarbon receptor 2 (AHR2) in zebrafish (Danio rerio).	Vitellogenins are hepatically derived yolk-protein precursors required for oogenesis in all oviparous teleosts. Altered gene-regulation of vitellogenesis by environmental contaminants can have profound effects on reproductive success, and ultimately population sustainability. To better understand chemical effects on vitellogenin gene regulation, we tested the hypothesis that activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor 2 (AHR2) by dioxin inhibits the estrogen receptor pathway regulation of 3 vitellogenin genes (vtg1-3) in vivo, using zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model teleost. Using an embryo-larval bioassay, embryos were either treated with 1000 pptr (parts-per-trillion, pg/mL) 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2) alone from 6h post fertilization (hpf) to 4 days post fertilization (dpf), or pre-treated with dioxin (4-5 hpf) prior to EE2. Pre-treatment with 400 pptr 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD) or 1,2,3,7,8-pentachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin inhibited the EE2 induction of vtg1, vtg2 and vtg3 by >95% (p≤0.05). In comparison, a splice-blocking AHR2 morpholino used to down-regulate ahr2 expression significantly reduced the inhibition of vtg1, vtg2 and vtg3 by 400 pptr 2,3,7,8-TCDD (20.7-27.4% rescue). These studies demonstrate that 2,3,7,8-TCDD directly inhibits the vitellogenin pathway in vivo through activation of the AHR2. This work provides evidence for AHR2 dependent cross-talk inhibition of vitellogenin genes and offers insight into anti-estrogenic reproductive effects observed in oviparous species exposed to AHR agonist contaminants.
10859452	Gene expression of the phosphodiesterases 3A and 5A in human corpus cavernosum penis.	OBJECTIVE: The following study was performed to evaluate the importance of phosphodiesterases 3A (PDE3A) and 5A (PDE5A) for the regulation of penile smooth muscle tone. Furthermore, indications of side effects of specific inhibitors in certain tissues as well as of a possible relation between the level of PDE3A and PDE5A gene expression and erectile dysfunction should have been deduced from the results obtained. METHODS: Total ribonucleic acid was isolated from different human tissues (urogenital tract, gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular system and central nervous system) and subjected to RTPCR analysis and Northern blotting using primers and probes specific for PDE3A and PDE5A. RESULTS: As shown by RT-PCR and Northern blotting, PDE3A and PDE5A mRNAs exhibit a distinct distribution throughout the tissues examined but were 2-fold higher in cavernous tissue than in all other tissues investigated. However, there were no significant differences in the levels of gene expression between the two subgroups of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Very high expression levels of PDE3A and PDE5A in human cavernous tissue underscore the physiological importance of these enzymes for the regulation of penile erection, emphasizing their therapeutical and pharmacological relevance. The distribution pattern of the mRNA for the isoenzymes PDE3A and PDE5A may explain the pharmacological effects as well as the side effects of milrinone and sidenafil.
23644411	Steroidal glycosides from the bulbs of Easter lily (Lilium longiflorum Thunb.) promote dermal fibroblast migration in vitro.	ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Preparations derived from bulbs of various Lilium species have been used to promote the healing of skin abrasions, sores and burns and to aid in healing wounds in Traditional Chinese and Greco-Roman Medicine. AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate fractionated Easter lily bulb extracts and their steroidal glycosides (1-5) for the promotion of dermal fibroblast migration in vitro, as a model for the early events in wound healing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An activity-guided screening approach was used by coupling sequential solvent extraction, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and semi-preparative reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) with an in vitro dermal fibroblast migration assay. Cytotoxicity was evaluated with methyl thiazole tetrazolium (MTT). To gain insight into the mode of action of the steroidal glycosides, nitric oxide (NO) production, and expression of genes for transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β) and its receptors were evaluated. RESULTS: Fractionated bulb extracts and the two isolated steroidal glycoalkaloids (1) and (2) induced NO production and TGF-β receptor I mRNA expression in fibroblast cell culture. In a cytotoxicity assay, steroidal glycosides (1) and (3) had IC50 values of 8.2 and 8.7µM, but the natural acetylation of the C-6″' hydroxy of the terminal glucose unit in (2) resulted in a 3-fold decrease in cell cytotoxicity when compared with (1). Results from the dermal fibroblast migration assay revealed that the steroidal glycoalkaloids (1) and (2), and the furostanol saponin (3) promoted fibroblast migration from the range of 23.7±5.7 to 37.7±5.1%, as compared with the control. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our data demonstrate that the steroidal glycosides present in Easter lily bulbs induce, at least in part, the observed dermal fibroblast migration activity of the bulb extracts. This is the first evidence that steroidal glycosides from L. longiflorum may potentially play a role in the wound healing process and may provide a scientific basis for the historical use of lily bulbs for this purpose.
23543012	In vitro characterisation of the anti-intravasative properties of the marine product heteronemin.	"Metastases destroy the function of infested organs and are the main reason of cancer-related mortality. Heteronemin, a natural product derived from a marine sponge, was tested in vitro regarding its properties to prevent tumour cell intravasation through the lymph-endothelial barrier. In three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures consisting of MCF-7 breast cancer cell spheroids that were placed on lymph-endothelial cell (LEC) monolayers, tumour cell spheroids induce ""circular chemorepellent-induced defects"" (CCIDs) in the LEC monolayer; 12(S)-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12(S)-HETE) and NF-κB activity are major factors inducing CCIDs, which are entry gates for tumour emboli intravasating the vasculature. This 3D co-culture is a validated model for the investigation of intravasation mechanisms and of drugs preventing CCID formation and hence lymph node metastasis. Furthermore, Western blot analyses, NF-κB reporter, EROD, SELE, 12(S)-HETE, and adhesion assays were performed to investigate the properties of heteronemin. Five micromolar heteronemin inhibited the directional movement of LECs and, therefore, the formation of CCIDs, which were induced by MCF-7 spheroids. Furthermore, heteronemin reduced the adhesion of MCF-7 cells to LECs and suppressed 12(S)-HETE-induced expression of the EMT marker paxillin, which is a regulator of directional cell migration. The activity of CYP1A1, which contributed to CCID formation, was also inhibited by heteronemin. Hence, heteronemin inhibits important mechanisms contributing to tumour intravasation in vitro and should be tested in vivo."
22512587	A review on the development in the field of NIDDM based thiazolidinedione PPARγ agonists.	Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptors gamma (PPARγ) are a class of ligand activated transcription factors with a prominent role in the regulation of metabolic processes. The present work aims towards examining the functional and structural features that facilitate the binding of small molecules based on Thiazolidinedione pharmacophore to PPARs. The intent of this article is to review all the reported thiazolidinediones and associated groups of PPARγ ligands.
14761877	Regulation of prostate-specific antigen by activin A in prostate cancer LNCaP cells.	Activins are multifunctional growth and differentiation factors and stimulate FSH-beta gene expression and FSH secretion by the pituitary gonadotropes. Follistatins bind activin, resulting in the neutralization of activin bioactivity. The activin/follistatin system is present in the prostate tissue. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) plays an important role in male reproductive physiology as well as being very important as a tumor marker for prostate cancer. Thus the regulation of PSA has important clinical implications. Previous studies showed that PSA is primarily regulated by androgens. In the present study, we evaluated the direct effects of activin A on the proliferation and PSA production of prostate cancer LNCaP cells, which express functional activin receptors and androgen receptor and PSA. LNCaP cells were treated with activin A and 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) with or without their antagonists (follistatin or the nonsteroidal anti-androgen bicalutamide). Activin A decreased cell growth of LNCaP cells in a dose-dependent manner, whereas DHT increased it in a biphasic manner. In contrast to their opposing actions on cell growth, both activin A and DHT upregulated PSA gene expression and increased PSA secretion by LNCaP cells. The effects of activin A and DHT to increase PSA production were synergistic or additive. Follistatin or bicalutamide was without effect on cell growth or PSA production. The effects of activin A on LNCaP cells were blocked by follistatin, not by bicalutamide, whereas effects of DHT were prevented by bicalutamide, not by follistatin. Activin A upregulates PSA production, and the effect is through an androgen receptor-independent pathway. The activin/follistatin system can be a physiological modulator of PSA gene transcription and secretion in the prostate tissue, and activins may cooperate with androgen to upregulate PSA in vivo.
23396078	Photochemical activation of TRPA1 channels in neurons and animals.	Optogenetics is a powerful research tool because it enables high-resolution optical control of neuronal activity. However, current optogenetic approaches are limited to transgenic systems expressing microbial opsins and other exogenous photoreceptors. Here, we identify optovin, a small molecule that enables repeated photoactivation of motor behaviors in wild-type zebrafish and mice. To our surprise, optovin's behavioral effects are not visually mediated. Rather, photodetection is performed by sensory neurons expressing the cation channel TRPA1. TRPA1 is both necessary and sufficient for the optovin response. Optovin activates human TRPA1 via structure-dependent photochemical reactions with redox-sensitive cysteine residues. In animals with severed spinal cords, optovin treatment enables control of motor activity in the paralyzed extremities by localized illumination. These studies identify a light-based strategy for controlling endogenous TRPA1 receptors in vivo, with potential clinical and research applications in nontransgenic animals, including humans.
17390078	Gene expression signature of parathion-transformed human breast epithelial cells.	Environmental substances seem to be involved in the etiology of breast cancers. Many studies have found an association between human cancer and exposure to agricultural pesticides such as the organophosphorous pesticides. Parathion is a cholinesterase inhibitor that induces the hydrolysis of body choline esters, including acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses. The primary target of action in insects is the nervous system whereby pesticides inhibit the release of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase at the synaptic junction. Atropine is a parasympatholytic alkaloid used as an antidote to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of parathion and atropine on cell transformation of human breast epithelial cells in vitro. These studies showed that parathion alone was able to induce malignant transformation of an immortalized human breast epithelial cell line, MCF-10F as indicated by increased cell proliferation, anchorage independency and invasive capabilities. There was also an increase in c-kit, Trio, Rho-A, Rac-3, EGFR, Notch-4, Dvl-2, Ezrin, beta catenin and mutant p53 protein expression in the parathion-treated cells. However, atropine significantly inhibited this increase. In a human cell cycle array of 96 genes, 13 of them were altered by parathion treatment. Among the genes affected were the cyclins, such as cyclin D3, the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) such as CDK41 and the minichromosome maintenance deficient (MCM) MCM2 and MCM3. It is suggested that parathion influences human breast epithelial cell transformation and is an initiator factor in the transformation process in breast cancer.
23085120	Bis(12)-hupyridone, a novel acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, protects against glutamate-induced neuronal excitotoxicity via activating α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor/phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt cascade.	Bis(12)-hupyridone (B12H), derived from the Chinese medicinal component huperzine A, was originally designed as a novel acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. In this paper, we report that B12H (24-h pretreatment) effectively blocked glutamate-induced neuronal excitotoxicity in cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs). However, the huge discrepancy between the EC50 value and IC50 value of B12H, to protect against neuronal toxicity (0.09μM) and to block the NMDA receptor (21.8μM) respectively, suggests that the neuroprotection of B12H might be not primarily due to the blockade of the NMDA receptor. Pretreatment by specific antagonists of alpha7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR), but not muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) or α4β2nAChR, decreased the neuroprotection of B12H. The neuroprotection of B12H could also be abolished by the pretreatment of specific PI3-K inhibitors. Furthermore, B12H restored the suppressed activation of the Akt pathway caused by glutamate as evidenced by the decreased expressions of pSer473-Akt and pSer9-GSK3β. All these results suggest that B12H substantially protected CGNs against glutamate-induced neuronal excitotoxicity via activating α7nAChR/PI3-K/Akt cascade.
23553997	Impact of Phytolacca americana Extracts on Gene Expression of Colon Cancer Cells.	Native Americans have used Phytolacca americana to treat breast ailments, gastrointestinal disorders, rashes, and inflammation. Some anti-cancer and anti-viral research has been reported on this perennial herb, but none has been published concerning the effects of its extracts on cancer cell genes. In this study, changes in gene expression at the transcription level were evaluated in HCT-116 colon cancer cells after exposure to P. americana ethanol extract and its water fraction using the Human Cancer Pathway Finder PCR Array. Of the genes significantly affected in HCT-116 cells exposed to the ethanol extract at 3200 µg/ml, changes in expression of MYC, PLAU, and TEK may benefit the treatment of colon cancer. Exposing the cells to 1600 µg/ml of the water fraction resulted in several gene changes that may also be beneficial in the treatment of colon cancer: NME4, TEK, and THBS1. A few genes on this array that are known to play a specific role in colon cancer had activities changed in a way that may be detrimental in the treatment of colon cancer. Further studies should be performed to understand how these changes would impact colon cancer treatment. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
17534402	A 27.368 kDa retinal reductase in New Zealand white rabbit liver cytosol encoded by the peroxisomal retinol dehydrogenase-reductase cDNA: purification and characterization of the enzyme.	We obtained a full-length cDNA based on a sequence deposited in GenBank (accession No. AB045133), annotated as rabbit peroxisomal NADP(H)-dependent retinol dehydrogenase-reductase (NDRD). The rabbit NDRD gene, like its mouse and human homologs, harbors 2 initiation sites, one of which theoretically encodes a 29.6 kDa protein with 279 amino acids, and the other encodes a 27.4 kDa protein with 260 amino acids. The purification of a rabbit cytosolic retinol oxidoreductase with a subunit molecular mass of 34 kDa and an N terminus that is not completely identical to that of NDRD, has been reported. An enzyme responsible for the all-trans retinal reductase activity in the liver cytosol of New Zealand white rabbit was purified to homogeneity using differential centrifugation and successive chromatographic analyses. The subunit molecular mass of the purified enzyme, revealed by SDS-PAGE, was approximately 27 kDa. The intact molecular mass, measured by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, was 27.368 kDa. The 60 kDa relative mobility observed in size-exclusion chromatography indicates that the native protein probably exists as a dimer. The purified enzyme was positively confirmed to be the product of NDRD by peptide mass fingerprinting, tandem mass spectrometry, and N-terminal sequencing. Taken together, the results suggested that the native protein is truncated at the N terminus.
22683935	Dendritic cell migration assay: a potential prediction model for identification of contact allergens.	This manuscript describes methodology and a prediction model for the MUTZ-LC migration assay. The assay represents the physiological change in Langerhans cell (LC) behavior after exposure to a sensitizing chemical, resulting in LC migration from the epidermis to the dermis. MUTZ-LC are derived from the commercially available MUTZ-3 cell line. Upon exposure to a sensitizer MUTZ-LC migrate preferentially towards CXCL12 whereas upon exposure to a non-sensitizer MUTZ-LC migrate towards CCL5. A CXCL12/CCL5 ratio >1.10 in 2/3 independent experiments is indicative of a sensitizer, whereas a CXCL12/CCL5 ratio ≤1.10 is indicative of a non-sensitizer. At non cytotoxic chemical concentrations 9 sensitizers (2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene, paraphenylendiamine, cinnamaldehyde, isoeugenol, nickel-sulfate, tetramethylthiuram disulfide, eugenol, cinnamic-alcohol, ammonium-hexachloroplatinate) were distinguished from 4 non sensitizers (sodium lauryl sulfate, salicylic acid, phenol, octanoic acid). Critical points in assay performance are (i) MUTZ-3 passage number after thawing (p6-p40); (ii) cell viability (>80%); (iii) standard curve to optimize correlation of fluorescence with cell number; and (iv) optimization of the concentration of rhCXCL12 and rhCCL5 in transwell. The protocol has been tested in three European laboratories and results suggest that it may provide working conditions for performing the DC migration assay which is aimed at distinguishing sensitizers from non sensitizers.
16517606	Novel tumor necrosis factor-responsive mammalian neutral sphingomyelinase-3 is a C-tail-anchored protein.	Two genes encoding neutral sphingomyelinases-1 and -2 (sphingomyelin phosphodiesterases-2 and -3) have been recently identified that hydrolyze sphingomyelin to phosphorylcholine and ceramide. Data bank searches using a peptide sequence derived from a previously purified bovine neutral sphingomyelinase (nSMase) allowed us to identify a cDNA encoding a novel human sphingomyelinase, nSMase3, that shows only a little homology to nSMase1 and -2. nSMase3 was biochemically characterized by overexpression in a yeast strain, JK9-3ddeltaIsc1p, lacking endogenous SMase activity. Similar to nSMase2, nSMase3 is Mg2+-dependent and shows optimal activity at pH 7, which is enhanced in the presence of phosphatidylserine and inhibited by scyphostatin. nSMase3 is ubiquitously expressed as a 4.6-kb mRNA species. nSMase3 lacks an N-terminal signal peptide, yet contains a 23-amino-acid transmembrane domain close to the C terminus, which is indicative for the family of C-tail-anchored integral membrane proteins. Cellular localization studies with hemagglutinin-tagged nSMase3 demonstrated colocalization with markers of the endoplasmic reticulum as well as with Golgi markers. Tumor necrosis factor stimulates rapid activation of nSMase3 in MCF7 cells with peak activity at 1.5 min, which was impaired by expression of dominant negative FAN.
23234812	Strontium Ranelate affects signaling from mechanically-stimulated osteocytes towards osteoclasts and osteoblasts.	Strontium Ranelate (SrRan) is used to decrease the risk of bone fractures. Any factor that alters the release of paracrine signals by osteocytes in response to mechanical stimuli potentially affects bone mass and structure, and thus fracture resistance. We hypothesized that SrRan affects paracrine signaling from mechanically-stimulated osteocytes towards osteoclast-precursors and osteoblasts. MLO-Y4 osteocytes were cultured for 24h with SrRan (0.1-3mM) and either or not mechanically stimulated by pulsating fluid flow (PFF; 0.7 ± 0.3 Pa, 5 Hz) for 60 min. Nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) release, and expression of mechanoresponsive genes were quantified. Conditioned medium (CM) from osteocytes was added to mouse bone marrow cells for 7 days to assess osteoclastogenesis, or MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts for 4-16 days to measure osteogenic gene expression. SrRan (3mM) enhanced NO and PGE(2) release to the same extent in static osteocytes (NO: 1.6-fold; PGE(2): 2.8-fold) and PFF-stimulated osteocytes (NO: 1.3-fold; PGE(2): 2.6-fold). CM from PFF-treated osteocytes without SrRan enhanced Ki67 expression but reduced Runx2 and Ocn expression in osteoblasts. This effect on gene expression was not observed with CM obtained from osteocytes treated with the combination of PFF and 3mM SrRan. CM from PFF-treated osteocytes inhibited osteoclastogenesis by 1.9-fold. The combination of PFF and 3mM SrRan reduced osteocyte-stimulated osteoclastogenesis even more strongly (4.3-fold). In conclusion, SrRan affects paracrine signaling between mechanically-stimulated MLO-Y4 osteocytes and both osteoblasts and osteoclast precursors. The positive effects of SrRan on bone fracture resistance may thus be partly explained by altered paracrine signaling by osteocytes.
23291240	Cerebral and extracerebral cholesterol metabolism and CSF markers of Alzheimer's disease.	The disturbances of the cholesterol synthesis and metabolism described in Alzheimer's disease (AD) may be both a consequence of the neurodegenerative process and a contributor to the pathogenesis. These putative relationships and their underlying mechanisms are not well understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the cerebral and extracerebral cholesterol synthesis and metabolism, and the AD pathology as reflected by CSF markers in humans. We evaluated the relationships between the plasma and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of cholesterol, the cholesterol precursors lanosterol, lathosterol and desmosterol, and the cholesterol elimination products 24S-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol, and the CSF markers for AD pathology Aβ1-42 and p-tau181 in 86 subjects with normal cognition and in 107 AD patients. CSF desmosterol, cholesterol and 24S-hydroxycholesterol in the AD group, and CSF 24S-hydroxycholesterol in the control group correlated with the p-tau181 levels. Neither CSF nor plasma concentrations of the included compounds correlated with the CSF Aβ1-42 levels. In multivariate regression tests including age, gender, albumin ratio, number of the APOEɛ4 alleles, and diagnosis, p-tau181 levels independently predicted the CSF desmosterol, cholesterol and 24S-hydroxycholesterol concentrations. The associations remained significant for CSF cholesterol and 24S-hydroxycholesterol when analyses were separately performed in the AD group. The results suggest that alterations of CNS cholesterol de novo genesis and metabolism are related to neurodegeneration and in particular to the cerebral accumulation of phosphorylated tau.
23327533	Species-dependent metabolism of a novel selective α7 neuronal acetylcholine receptor agonist ABT-107.	Abstract 1. Metabolism of ABT-107 was investigated in in vitro hepatic systems, in rat and monkey receiving [(14)C]ABT-107, and in vivo plasma in rat, dog, monkey and human. 2. In in vitro hepatic systems, ABT-107 was primarily cleared via oxidative metabolism, and proceeded via two parallel pathways. Pathway 1, ABT-107 was oxidized at the nitrogen of quinuclidine moiety to form M1. Pathway 2, oxidation occurred at indole-containing moiety to form M2. Metabolism via N-oxidation was predominant in dog and rat, while in monkey and human, metabolism proceeded primarily via oxidation of indole-containing moiety. 3. ABT-107 was extensively metabolized in vivo in rat and monkey. M1 was primarily found in rat urine and bile; whereas, M2 was the major metabolite in monkey urine and feces. M1 was the predominant circulating metabolite in dog and rat. M2 was the primary circulating metabolite in monkey and human. 4. Enzymatic studies suggested M1 formation was primarily mediated by renal FMO1. CYP3A4, 1A2, 2J2 and 2D6 were primary enzymes catalyzing M2 formation. 5. Biotransformation of ABT-107 in human and monkey is markedly different from that in dog and rat, suggesting that monkey is an appropriate model for predicting human biotransformation and toxicology of ABT-107.
17229090	Role of the calcium modulated cyclases in the development of the retinal projections.	Transmembrane isoforms of adenylate cyclases (AC) integrate a wide variety of extracellular signals from neurotransmitters to morphogens and can also regulate cAMP production in response to calcium entry. Based on observations in the barrelless mouse strain, the Adcy1 gene (AC1) was involved in the segregation of binocular retinal inputs. To determine the potential role of other AC isoforms we localized the Adcy genes in the visual centres during development, using in situ hybridization. Six different AC subtypes were found in the developing retinal ganglion cell layer (RGC; AC1, AC2, AC3, AC5, AC8, and AC9), and three AC subtypes were expressed in the central brain targets, the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (AC1 and AC8), the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus (AC2 and AC8) and the superior colliculus (AC1, AC2, AC8). Using a genetic approach we tested the role of the calcium modulated cyclases AC1, AC5 and AC8 for the segregation retinal fibres. Ipsilateral retinal axons remained exuberant in the AC1(-/-) mice, with overlapping retinal projections from both eyes in the superior colliculus and the visual thalamus. These abnormalities were similar to those of barrelless mouse mutants. No abnormalities were detectable in the AC5(-/-) or the AC8(-/-) mice. Similar abnormalities were noted in the single AC1(-/-) and the AC1/AC8 double-knockout mice (DKO). Thus, only AC1 is required for the maturation of the retinal axon terminals whereas AC5 and AC8 are not needed. The specificity of AC1's action is linked to its cellular localization in the RGCs and to its distinctive functional profile, compared with the other cyclases expressed in the same cells.
23643747	Haloperidol promotes mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 via dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of 32 kDa and inhibition of protein phosphatase-1.	The ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) is a component of the small 40S ribosomal subunit, involved in multiple physiological functions. Here, we examined the effects produced by haloperidol, a typical antipsychotic drug, on the phosphorylation of rpS6 at Ser240/244 in the striatum, a brain region involved in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Administration of haloperidol increased Ser240/244 phosphorylation in a subpopulation of GABA-ergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs), which express dopamine D2 receptors (D2Rs). This effect was prevented by rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), or by PF470867, a selective inhibitor of the p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1). We also found that the effect of haloperidol on Ser240/244 phosphorylation was prevented by functional inactivation of dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of 32 kDa (DARPP-32), an endogenous inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1 (PP-1). In line with this observation, incubation of striatal slices with okadaic acid and calyculin A, two inhibitors of PP-1, increased Ser240/244 phosphorylation. These results show that haloperidol promotes mTORC1- and S6K1-dependent phosphorylation of rpS6 at Ser240/244, in a subpopulation of striatal MSNs expressing D2Rs. They also indicate that this effect is exerted by suppressing dephosphorylation at Ser240/244, through PKA-dependent activation of DARPP-32 and inhibition of PP-1.
23411272	Oligomeric procyanidins of lotus seedpod inhibits the formation of advanced glycation end-products by scavenging reactive carbonyls.	It has been reported that oligomeric procyanidins of lotus seedpod (LSOPC) is effective in the alleviation of Alzheimer's disease and diabetes through its antioxidant and insulin-potentiating activities. This study investigated the anti-glycative activity of LSOPC in a bovine serum albumin (BSA)-glucose model. The level of glycation and conformational alterations were assessed by specific fluorescence, Congo red binding assay and circular dichroism. The results show that LSOPC has a significant anti-glycative activity in vitro and it can also effectively protect the secondary structure of BSA during glycation. LSOPC or catechin (a major constituent unit of LSOPC), were used to react with methylglyoxal. The structures of their carbonyl adducts were tentatively identified using HPLC-MS(2). Their capacity to scavenge methylglyoxal suggested carbonyl scavenging as a major mechanism of antiglycation. Therefore, LSOPC could be helpful to prevent AGEs-associated diseases, and with the potential to be used as functional food ingredients.
23432582	Bisacylimidoselenocarbamates Cause G2/M Arrest Associated with the Modulation of CDK1 and Chk2 in Human Breast Cancer MCF-7 Cells.	Bisacylimidoselenocarbamate derivatives (BSC) are potent anticancer agents with a strong cytotoxic activity against different types of tumour cells. Based in phosphatidylserine exposure on the cell membranes we show that BSC treatment resulted in enhanced cell death in leukaemia CCRF-CEM cells. DNA fragmentation detection in breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells showed that BSC triggered cell death is concentration and time dependent. We also show that two of these compounds, BSC 3g and 3n, cause cell-cycle arrest in the late G2/M in MCF-7 cells. Consistent with this, a reduction in CDK1 and CDK2 expression with no change in cyclin A an B1 was observed in this cell line. Activation of caspase-2 was also detected. However, the involvement of the caspase-dependent pathway in the process of cell death induced by either BSC 3g or 3n is discarded since cell death could not be prevented by pretreatment with the pancaspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. Moreover, since reduced levels of p21CIP1 and Chk2 proteins but no change in p53 levels could be detected in MCF-7 cells after BSC 3g or 3n treatment our results suggest that BSC treated cells die from lethal mitosis.
23294566	Anterior gradient 2 and 3--two prototype androgen-responsive genes transcriptionally upregulated by androgens and by oestrogens in prostate cancer cells.	Androgens and oestrogens have been implicated in prostatic carcinogenesis and tumour progression. Although the actions of androgens have been studied extensively, the mechanisms underlying oestrogen signalling in prostate cancer are not fully understood. In the present study, we analyzed the effect of androgens and oestrogens on the expression of anterior gradient 2 (AGR2) and anterior gradient 3 (AGR3), comprising two highly-related genes encoding secretory proteins that are expressed in prostate cancer and one of which (AGR2) has been associated with tumour metastasis. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR and western blot analysis showed androgen induction of AGR2 and AGR3 in three androgen receptor positive cell lines, starting at concentrations of 0.1 nm. Both AGR genes were also transcriptionally activated by ≥ 5 nM oestradiol but not by isotype selective or nonselective oestrogen receptor agonists in DUCaP cells that harbour a high-level of wild-type androgen receptor. A functional androgen receptor but not oestrogen receptor turned out to be required for both androgen and oestrogen regulation. This pattern of androgen and oestrogen regulation was confirmed in VCaP cells and was also observed for FKBP5, a well-characterized androgen-regulated gene. Genome-wide chromatin-immunoprecipitation studies coupled with deep sequencing identified androgen receptor binding sites localized in the distal promoter and intron regions of the AGR2 and AGR3 genes, respectively. The androgen responsiveness of these enhancers was verified by luciferase reporter gene assays and site-directed mutagenesis analysis. Androgen treatment also induced p300 and RNA Pol II recruitment to androgen receptor enhancers of AGR2 and initiated local chromatin remodelling and the formation of RNA Pol II-containing androgen receptor transcription complexes.
23465614	Anti-adipogenic diarylheptanoids from Alnus hirsuta f. sibirica on 3T3-L1 cells.	A new diarylheptanoid, (5S)-hydroxy-1-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-7-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-hepta-1E-en-3-one (1), was isolated along with seventeen known diarylheptanoids (2-18) from the methanol extract of Alnus hirsuta f. sibirica leaves using bioactivity-guided fractionation. Among the isolated compounds, compounds 1 and 2 and 4-12 reduced lipid accumulation dose-dependently in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Of the compounds active in the present assay system, the most potent compound 7, platyphyllonol-5-O-β-d-xylopyranoside, significantly suppressed the induction of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα) protein expression, and inhibited adipocyte differentiation induced by troglitazone, a PPARγ agonist. It was demonstrated that compound 7 has anti-adipogenic activity mediated by the regulation of PPARγ dependent pathways.
15481993	New water-soluble sulfonylphosphoramidic acid derivatives of the COX-2 selective inhibitor cimicoxib. A novel approach to sulfonamide prodrugs.	The synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of new water-soluble phosphoramidate derivatives of the COX-2 selective inhibitor cimicoxib (4) are described. The sulfonylphosphoramidic acid derivative 10 was converted to 4 in human plasma and showed excellent in vivo activity in the rat carrageenan-edema test. Pharmacokinetic evaluation in dogs indicated that 10 behaved as a prodrug, immediately converting to 4 and giving an identical profile to that of the parent compound. These results represent the first description of phosphoramidic acids as prodrugs for the sulfonamido group. Compound 10 also exhibited an important and sustained analgesic effect in the hyperalgesia test in rats and a high aqueous solubility at pH higher than 7. This profile led to the selection of 10 (UR-14048) for further development in the parenteral treatment of acute pain.
12172398	Influences of the PPAR alpha-L162V polymorphism on plasma HDL(2)-cholesterol response of abdominally obese men treated with gemfibrozil.	PURPOSE: The effect of gemfibrozil is mediated by the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha). The objective of this study was to determine whether the lipid response to gemfibrozil therapy is influenced by the PPAR alpha-L162V polymorphism. METHODS: Sixty-three abdominally obese men were randomly assigned to a 6-month-intervention program with either receiving a placebo (N = 31) or gemfibrozil (N = 32). RESULTS: In response to gemfibrozil therapy, L162-homozygotes exhibited a 5.5% increase in high-density lipoprotein 2 cholesterol (HDL(2)-C) levels compared with a 50.0% increase among carriers of the V162 allele (P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the HDL(2)-C response to gemfibrozil is modulated by the PPAR alpha-L162V polymorphism.
23527317	Exploring the effect of N-substitution in nor-lobelane on the interaction with VMAT2: discovery of a potential clinical candidate for treatment of methamphetamine abuse.	A series of N-substituted lobelane analogues was synthesized and evaluated for their [(3)H]dihydrotetrabenazine binding affinity at the vesicular monoamine transporter and for their inhibition of vesicular [(3)H]dopamine uptake. Compound 19a, which contains an N-1,2(R)-dihydroxypropyl group, had been identified as a potential clinical candidate for the treatment of methamphetamine abuse.
8740147	Amezinium and debrisoquine are substrates of uptake1 and potent inhibitors of monoamine oxidase in perfused lungs of rats.	Previous studies have resulted in the classification of amezinium as a selective inhibitor of neuronal monoamine oxidase (MAO), because it is a much more potent MAO inhibitor in intact tissues, in which it is accumulated in noradrenergic neurones by uptake1, than in tissue homogenates. In the present study, the effects of amezinium on the deamination of noradrenaline were investigated in intact lungs of rats, since the pulmonary endothelial cells are a site where the catecholamine transporter is non-neuronal uptake1. In addition, another drug that is both a substrate of uptake1 and a MAO inhibitor, debrisoquine, was investigated in the study. The first aim of the study was to show whether amezinium and debrisoquine are substrates of uptake1 in rat lungs. After loading of isolated perfused lungs with 3H-noradrenaline (MAO and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibited), the efflux of 3H-noradrenaline was measured for 30 min. When 1 mumol/l amezinium or 15 mumol/l debrisoquine was added for the last 15 min of efflux, there was a rapid and marked increase in the fractional rate of loss of 3H-noradrenaline, which was reduced by about 70% when 1 mumol/l desipramine was present throughout the efflux period. These results showed that both drugs were substrates for uptake1 in rat lungs. In lungs perfused with 1 nmol/l 3H-noradrenaline (COMT inhibited), 10, 30 and 300 nmol/l amezinium caused 58%, 76% and 74% inhibition of noradrenaline deamination, respectively, and 30, 300 and 3000 nmol/l debrisoquine caused 56%, 89% and 96% inhibition of noradrenaline deamination, respectively. When MAO-B was also inhibited, 10 nmol/l amezinium caused 84% inhibition of the deamination of noradrenaline by MAO-A in the lungs. In contrast, in hearts perfused with 10 nmol/l 3H-noradrenaline under conditions where the amine was accumulated by uptake2 (COMT, uptake1 and vesicular transport inhibited), 10 nmol/l amezinium had no effect and 300 nmol/l amezinium caused only 36% inhibition of deamination of noradrenaline. The results when considered with previous reports in the literature show that amezinium is about 1000 times more potent and debrisoquine is about 20 times more potent for MAO inhibition in rat lungs than in tissue homogenates, and the reason for their high potencies in the intact lungs is transport and accumulation of the drugs in the pulmonary endothelial cells by uptake1. Amezinium is much less potent as a MAO inhibitor in cells with the uptake2 transporter, such as the myocardial cells of the heart. The results also confirmed previous reports that amezinium is highly selective for MAO-A.
23469927	Polyclonal Antibody to Soman-Tyrosine.	Soman forms a stable, covalent bond with tyrosine 411 of human albumin, with tyrosines 257 and 593 in human transferrin, and with tyrosine in many other proteins. The pinacolyl group of soman is retained, suggesting that pinacolyl methylphosphonate bound to tyrosine could generate specific antibodies. Tyrosine in the pentapeptide RYGRK was covalently modified with soman simply by adding soman to the peptide. The phosphonylated-peptide was linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and the conjugate was injected into rabbits. The polyclonal antiserum recognized soman-labeled human albumin, soman-mouse albumin, and soman human transferrin but not nonphosphonylated control proteins. The soman-labeled tyrosines in these proteins are surrounded by different amino acid sequences, suggesting that the polyclonal recognizes soman-tyrosine independent of the amino acid sequence. Antiserum obtained after 4 antigen injections over a period of 18 weeks was tested in a competition ELISA where it had an IC50 of 10(-11) M. The limit of detection on Western blots was 0.01 μg (15 picomoles) of soman-labeled albumin. In conclusion, a high-affinity, polyclonal antibody that specifically recognizes soman adducts on tyrosine in a variety of proteins has been produced. Such an antibody could be useful for identifying secondary targets of soman toxicity.
11682453	alpha(1)-Adrenoceptor subtypes in the mouse mesenteric artery and abdominal aorta.	1. Subtypes of alpha(1)-adrenoceptor-mediated contractions to noradrenaline in mouse mesenteric artery and abdominal aorta were examined. 2. In mesenteric artery, BMY7378, 5-methylurapidil, WB4101 and prazosin were inhibited contraction to noradrenaline The good correlation for pA(2) values of antagonists in native alpha(1D)- (rat thoracic aorta) adrenoceptor subtype and pK(i) values in rat cloned alpha(1d)-adrenoceptor with the pA(2) values estimated in the mouse mesenteric artery was obtained. However, the pA(2) value for BMY7378 is significantly lower than the accepted value against the alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor subtype. 3. In the abdominal aorta, it was obtained the regional difference for the sensitivity for noradrenaline. 4. In the upper abdominal aorta, the good correlation for the pA(2) values of the antagonists in the native alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor subtype and pK(i) values in the cloned alpha(1d)-adrenoceptor with the pA(2) values estimated in the upper abdominal aorta was obtained, and regression line was close to the line of identity. 5. In the lower abdominal aorta, the good correlation for the reported pK(i) values in the cloned alpha(1a)-adrenoceptor subtype with the pA(2) values estimated in the mouse lower abdominal aorta was obtained, and regression line was close to the line of identity. 6. In conclusion, the present functional data in the mouse suggest that (1) alpha(1D)-like adrenoceptors are present in the mesenteric artery, (2) there is the regional difference for the sensitivity for noradrenaline in the abdominal aorta and (3) noradrenaline evokes the contraction mediated through alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor in the upper abdominal aorta, whereas there is alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor-mediated contraction in the lower abdominal aorta.
23147414	Linking GABA(A) receptor subunits to alcohol-induced conditioned taste aversion and recovery from acute alcohol intoxication.	GABA type A receptors (GABA(A)-R) are important for ethanol actions and it is of interest to link individual subunits with specific ethanol behaviors. We studied null mutant mice for six different GABA(A)-R subunits (α1, α2, α3, α4, α5 and δ). Only mice lacking the α2 subunit showed reduction of conditioned taste aversion (CTA) to ethanol. These results are in agreement with data from knock-in mice with mutation of the ethanol-sensitive site in the α2-subunit (Blednov et al., 2011). All together, they indicate that aversive property of ethanol is dependent on ethanol action on α2-containing GABA(A)-R. Deletion of the α2-subunit led to faster recovery whereas absence of the α3-subunit slowed recovery from ethanol-induced incoordination (rotarod). Deletion of the other four subunits did not affect this behavior. Similar changes in this behavior for the α2 and α3 null mutants were found for flurazepam motor incoordination. However, no differences in recovery were found in motor-incoordinating effects of an α1-selective modulator (zolpidem) or an α4-selective agonist (gaboxadol). Therefore, recovery of rotarod incoordination is under control of two GABA(A)-R subunits: α2 and α3. For motor activity, α3 null mice demonstrated higher activation by ethanol (1 g/kg) whereas both α2 (-/-) and α3 (-/Y) knockout mice were less sensitive to ethanol-induced reduction of motor activity (1.5 g/kg). These studies demonstrate that the effects of ethanol at GABAergic synapses containing α2 subunit are important for specific behavioral effects of ethanol which may be relevant to the genetic linkage of the α2 subunit with human alcoholism.
10566562	Comparison of rofecoxib and celecoxib, two cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, in postoperative dental pain: a randomized, placebo- and active-comparator-controlled clinical trial.	Pain is a common complaint, often occurring in conjunction with inflammation. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most commonly used analgesic agents in ambulatory patients. In recent studies, the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor rofecoxib demonstrated analgesic effects similar to those of NSAIDs in the treatment of acute pain and primary dysmenorrhea. The present randomized, single-dose, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and active-comparator-controlled, parallel-group study was undertaken to compare the analgesic efficacy of the COX-2 inhibitors rofecoxib 50 mg and celecoxib 200 mg with that of ibuprofen 400 mg and placebo in patients with postoperative dental pain. Two hundred and seventy-two patients experiencing pain after the removal of > or =2 third molars were randomized according to pain severity (moderate vs severe) to receive a single dose of placebo (n = 45), rofecoxib 50 mg (n = 90), celecoxib 200 mg (n = 91), or ibuprofen 400 mg (n = 46). Using a patient diary, patients recorded pain intensity, pain relief, and global evaluations throughout the 24-hour period after dosing. The overall analgesic effect, onset of action, peak effect, and duration of effect were evaluated, with the primary end point being total pain relief over 8 hours (TOPAR8). The safety profile was assessed on the basis of physical findings, laboratory results, and spontaneous reports of adverse experiences. The results showed that compared with celecoxib, rofecoxib had superior analgesic effects on all measures of analgesic efficacy, including overall analgesic effect (TOPAR8, 18.3 vs. 12.5; P<0.001), time to onset of effect (30 vs. 60 minutes; P = 0.003), peak pain relief (score, 2.8 vs 2.3; P<0.05), and duration of effect (>24 vs. 5.1 hours; P<0.001). In addition, rofecoxib's analgesic efficacy was similar to that of ibuprofen (TOPAR8, 18.3 vs. 17.0; P = 0.460), but the duration was longer (P<0.05); with ibuprofen, the time to on set was 24 minutes, peak pain relief score was 2.9, and duration of analgesic effect was 8.9 hours. The safety profile was similar across all treatment groups. Thus rofecoxib provided analgesic efficacy superior to that of celecoxib and comparable to that of ibuprofen in the treatment of patients with acute postoperative dental pain.
2901134	Cysteamine-induced reduction in gastrointestinal somatostatin: evidence for a region-specific loss in immunoreactivity.	Administration of cysteamine (beta-mercaptoethylamine; 2-aminoethanethiol) to rats has been shown to decrease the levels of somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SLI) in the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas but its mode of action is unclear. In the current study the effect of cysteamine on gastrointestinal and pancreatic SLI has been studied using two antisera with different regional specificities. In addition, the in vitro effect of cysteamine on SS-14 and SS-28 has been studied by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Characterization of the two antisera (AS 26.3.2 and AS 1001) with a range of analogs of SS-14 revealed that both were directed against the midportion of the molecule but that AS 1001 was also sensitive to changes at the N- and C-termini. Tissue extracts from cysteamine-treated rats measured with AS 26.3.2 showed no significant change for the stomach, jejunum or pancreas but duodenal levels were reduced. With AS 1001 SLI levels were reduced in all tissues. Gel permeation chromatography of stomach extracts measured with AS 1001 showed a reduction in both SS-14 and SS-28. With AS 26.3.2 an increase in SLI eluting prior to the SS-14 peak occurred explaining why no significant reduction in total SLI was detected. With duodenal extracts the elution profiles with AS 1001 reflected the large reduction in total SLI whereas with AS 26.3.2 a smaller reduction occurred. Both SS-14 and SS-28 were reduced. HPLC analysis of SS-14 and SS-28 following incubation with cysteamine in vitro showed a time-dependent decrease in both somatostatin species with absorbance at 280 nm was measured. New peptide peaks which developed were not all detectable by radioimmunoassay with either antibody. The results suggest that cysteamine causes a change in the structure of somatostatin which probably first involves a reduction of the disulphide bridge and then the N- and C-terminal regions of the molecule thus making it unmeasurable by antisera sensitive to changes in these regions.
23479318	Association of cadmium and lead with antioxidant status and incidence of benign prostatic hyperplasia in patients of Western India.	The association of cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) in the pathophysiology and progression of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) has been evaluated in an epidemiological study with 116 BPH patients of the western part of India. The prostatic acid phosphatase activity, prostate-specific antigen, maximum urinary flow rate (Q max), and redox status of BPH patients were correlated with Cd and Pb contents. Additionally, patients were also separated on the basis of their age, genetic lineage, and additive habits and correlated with the Cd, Pb, and Q max levels. Our results suggest that the accumulation of toxic metals in prostate tissue has a significant positive correlation with the pathogenesis of BPH. Cd and Pb exert their effects through altered antioxidant defense mechanisms, ultimately leading to increased BPH severity. Progression of the pathogenesis also depends on other factors such as additive habits, genetic lineage, and age of the patients.
10903648	Low grade inflammation and coronary heart disease: prospective study and updated meta-analyses.	OBJECTIVE: To assess associations between baseline values of four different circulating markers of inflammation and future risk of coronary heart disease, potential triggers of systemic inflammation (such as persistent infection), and other markers of inflammation. DESIGN: Nested case-control comparisons in a prospective, population based cohort. SETTING: General practices in 18 towns in Britain. PARTICIPANTS: 506 men who died from coronary heart disease or had a non-fatal myocardial infarction and 1025 men who remained free of such disease until 1996 selected from 5661 men aged 40-59 years who provided blood samples in 1978-1980. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Plasma concentrations of C reactive protein, serum amyloid A protein, and serum albumin and leucocyte count. Information on fatal and non-fatal coronary heart disease was obtained from medical records and death certificates. RESULTS: Compared with men in the bottom third of baseline measurements of C reactive protein, men in the top third had an odds ratio for coronary heart disease of 2.13 (95% confidence interval 1.38 to 3.28) after age, town, smoking, vascular risk factors, and indicators of socioeconomic status were adjusted for. Similar adjusted odds ratios were 1.65 (1.07 to 2.55) for serum amyloid A protein; 1.12 (0.71 to 1.77) for leucocyte count; and 0.67 (0.43 to 1.04) for albumin. No strong associations were observed of these factors with Helicobacter pylori seropositivity, Chlamydia pneumoniae IgG titres, or plasma total homocysteine concentrations. Baseline values of the acute phase reactants were significantly associated with one another (P<0.0001), although the association between low serum albumin concentration and leucocyte count was weaker (P=0.08). CONCLUSION: In the context of results from other relevant studies these findings suggest that some inflammatory processes, unrelated to the chronic infections studied here, are likely to be involved in coronary heart disease.
17486539	Retinoic acid is required for specification of the ventral eye field and for Rathke's pouch in the avian embryo.	We have investigated the role of retinoic acid (RA) in eye development using the vitamin A deficient quail model system, which overcomes problems of retinoic acid synthesising enzyme redundancy in the embryo. In the absence of retinoic acid, the ventral optic stalk and ventral retina are missing, whereas the dorsal optic stalk and dorsal retina develop appropriately. Other ocular abnormalities observed were a thinner retina and the lack of differentiation of the lens. In an attempt to explain this, we studied the expression of various dorsally and ventrally expressed genes such as Pax2, Pax6, Tbx6, Vax2, Raldh1 and Raldh3 and noted that they were unchanged in their expression patterns. In contrast, the RA catabolising enzymes Cyp26A1 and Cyp26B1 which are known to be RA-responsive were not expressed at all in the developing eye. At much earlier stages, the expression domain of Shh in the prechordal plate was reduced, as was Nkx2.1 and we suggest a model whereby the eye field is specified according to the concentration of SHH protein that is present. We also describe another organ, Rathke's pouch which fails to develop in the absence of retinoic acid. We attribute this to the down-regulation of Bmp2, Shh and Fgf8 which are known to be involved in the induction of this structure.
23518299	Neuroprotective effect of sulforaphane in 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned mouse model of Parkinson's disease.	Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the selective loss of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons, which leads to disabling motor disturbances. Sulforaphane (SFN), found in cruciferous vegetables, is a potent indirect antioxidant and recent advances have shown its neuroprotective activity in various experimental models of neurodegeneration. This study was undertaken to examine the effects of SFN on behavioral changes and dopaminergic neurotoxicity in mice exposed to 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). For this purpose, mice were treated with SFN (5mg/kg twice a week) for four weeks after the unilateral intrastriatal injection of 6-OHDA. The increase in 6-OHDA-induced rotations and deficits in motor coordination were ameliorated significantly by SFN treatment. In addition, SFN protected 6-OHDA-induced apoptosis via blocking DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 activation. These results were further supported by immunohistochemical findings in the substantia nigra that showed that SFN protected neurons from neurotoxic effects of 6-OHDA. The neuroprotective effect of SFN may be attributed to its ability to enhance glutathione levels and its dependent enzymes (glutathione-S-transferase and glutathione reductase) and to modulate neuronal survival pathways, such as ERK1/2, in the brain of mice. These results suggest that SFN may potentially be effective in slowing down the progression of idiopathic PD by the modulation of oxidative stress and apoptotic machinery.
23197773	Analysis of tolerance and behavioral/physical dependence during chronic CB1 agonist treatment: effects of CB1 agonists, antagonists, and noncannabinoid drugs.	Behavioral studies of chronic CB(1) receptor activation may provide a pharmacological approach to understanding efficacy-related differences among CB(1) ligands as well as mechanistic commonalities between cannabinoid and noncannabinoid drugs. In the present studies, the effects of CB(1) agonists [(6aR,10aR)-3-(1-adamantyl)-6,6,9-trimethyl-6a,7,10,10a-tetrahydrobenzo[c]chromen-1-ol (AM411), 9β-(hydroxymethyl)-3-(1-adamantyl)-hexahydrocannabinol (AM4054), R-(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-[(morpholinyl)methyl]pyrrolo[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazinyl]-(1-naphthalenyl)methanone mesylate (WIN55,212.2), Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ(9)-THC), (R)-(+)-arachidonyl-1'-hydroxy-2'-propylamide (methanandamide)], CB(1) antagonists [5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichloro-phenyl)-4-methyl-N-(piperidin-1-yl)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide (SR141716A), 5-(4-alkylphenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-N-(piperidin-1-yl)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide (AM4113)], and dopamine (DA)-related [methamphetamine, (±)-6-chloro-7,8-dihydroxy-3-allyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine hydrobromide (SKF82958), (R)-(+)-7-chloro-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine hydrochloride (SCH23390), (6aR)-5,6,6a,7-tetrahydro-6-propyl-4H-dibenzo[de,g]quinoline-10,11-diol (R-(-)-NPA), haloperidol] and opioid (morphine, naltrexone) drugs on scheduled-controlled responding under a 30-response fixed ratio schedule of stimulus-shock termination in squirrel monkeys were compared before and during chronic treatment with the long-acting CB(1) agonist AM411 (1.0 mg/kg per day, i.m.). Prechronic treatment with all drugs except naltrexone (1-10 mg/kg) produced dose-related decreases in responses rates. Dose-response re-determinations during chronic treatment revealed the following: 1) >250-fold (AM411, methanandamide) and >45-fold (AM4054, WIN55,212.2, Δ(9)-THC) rightward shifts in the ED(50) values for CB(1) agonists; 2) >100-fold and >20-fold leftward shifts in the ED(50) values for SR141716A and AM4113, respectively; and 3) approximately 4.8-fold and 10-fold rightward shifts in the ED(50) values for methamphetamine and the DA D(2) agonist R-(-)-NPA, respectively. Dose-response relationships for other DA-related and opioid drugs were unchanged by chronic CB(1) agonist treatment. Differences in the magnitude of tolerance among CB(1) agonists during chronic treatment may be indicative of differences in their pharmacological efficacy, whereas the enhanced sensitivity to behaviorally disruptive effects of CB(1) antagonists may provide evidence for CB(1)-related behavioral and/or physical dependence. Finally, the development of cross-tolerance to methamphetamine and R-(-)-NPA bolsters previous evidence of interplay between CB(1) and DA D(2) signaling mechanisms.
16633980	Androgen physiology.	Androgen receptors are present in numerous tissues throughout the female body, and knowledge of the specific actions of androgens at different sites is increasing, along with the understanding of their contribution to various pathophysiological states. This article reviews the physiology of androgens (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone) and immediate androgen precursors (dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA], dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate [DHEAS], and androstenedione), with specific reference to the androgen receptor, production and metabolism of C- (19) steroids, circulating androgen concentrations, and androgen actions. In addition, the evidence for physiological modulation of androgens including circadian variation, cyclical variation, age, and natural menopause is reviewed.
23211524	GATA2-induced silencing and LIM-homeodomain protein-induced activation are mediated by a bi-functional response element in the rat GnRH receptor gene.	GATA2 transcription factor and LIM homeodomain proteins Islet1 (ISL1) and LIM homeobox 3 (LHX3) are suspected to be involved in gonadotrope cell fate and maintenance. The GnRH receptor gene (Gnrhr), crucial for gonadotrope function, is expressed in the pituitary gland from embryonic day 13.5 onward, well before LH and FSH β-subunits. This expression pattern together with the presence of WGATAR and TAAT motifs in Gnrhr promoter sequences suggests the involvement of early transcription factors in promoter activation. In this study, using a well-characterized transgenic mouse model, GATA2 was found colocalized with Gnrhr promoter activity in the pituitary. Transient transfection of Gnrhr promoter luciferase fusion constructs together with either GATA2 expression vectors or small interfering RNA in gonadotrope cell lines indicated that GATA2, which typically acts as a trans-activator, unexpectedly repressed Gnrhr promoter activity. Using DNA chromatography affinity and EMSA, we demonstrated that GATA2 operates via a response element containing a peculiar palindromic GATA motif that overlaps a critical TAAT motif involved in LHX3/ISL1 trans-activation. Indeed, despite the inhibitory action of GATA2, this element displayed a clear-cut enhancer activity in gonadotrope cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that GATA2, LHX3, and ISL1 interact with a Gnrhr promoter fragment encompassing this element. The trans-repressive action of GATA2 on Gnrhr promoter activity is likely balanced or even hindered by trans-activating effects of LIM homeodomain proteins via this novel bifunctional LIM/GATA response element. Such a hierarchical interplay may contribute to finely adjust Gnrhr gene expression in gonadotrope cell lineage during pituitary development as well as in the adult animal.
23352144	Biofilm inhibitors that target amyloid proteins.	Bacteria establish stable communities, known as biofilms, that are resistant to antimicrobials. Biofilm robustness is due to the presence of an extracellular matrix, which for several species-among them Bacillus subtilis-includes amyloid-like protein fibers. In this work, we show that B. subtilis biofilms can be a simple and reliable tool for screening of molecules with antiamyloid activity. We identified two molecules, AA-861 and parthenolide, which efficiently inhibited biofilms by preventing the formation of amyloid-like fibers. Parthenolide also disrupted pre-established biofilms. These molecules also impeded the formation of biofilms of other bacterial species that secrete amyloid proteins, such as Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli. Furthermore, the identified molecules decreased the conversion of the yeast protein New1 to the prion state in a heterologous host, indicating the broad range of activity of the molecules.
23570615	Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinases (ERK) Inhibitors from Aristolochia yunnanensis.	Six new sesquiterpenoids, aristoyunnolins A-F (1-6), an artifact of isolation [7-O-ethyl madolin W (7)], and 12 known analogues were isolated from stems of Aristolochia yunnanensis. The structures were determined by combined chemical and spectral methods, and the absolute configurations of compounds 2, 3, 5-7, 9, 14, and 17 were determined by the modified Mosher's method and CD analysis. Compounds 1-19 were screened using a bioassay system designed to evaluate the effect on mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling pathways. Among three MAPKs (ERK1/2, JNK, and p38), compounds 1, 4, 10-13, 16, 18, and 19 exhibited selective inhibition of the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Compounds 16 and 19 were more active than the positive control PD98059, a known inhibitor of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway.
23292170	Marked decline in beta cell function during pregnancy leads to the development of glucose intolerance in Japanese women.	The aim of this study is to investigate glucose metabolism longitudinally during pregnancy to explore mechanisms underlying gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). We reviewed a total of 62 pregnant Japanese women who underwent a 75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) twice during pregnancy (median: early, 13; late, 28 weeks' gestation) because of positive GDM screening. All showed normal OGTT results in early pregnancy. Based on late OGTT, 15 had GDM (late-onset GDM) and 47 normal glucose tolerance (NGT). In early pregnancy, there were no significant differences in insulin sensitivity (insulin sensitivity index derived from OGTT [ISOGTT] and homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance [HOMA-IR]) and insulin secretion (a ratio of the total area-under-the-insulin-curve to the total area-under-the-glucose-curve [AUCins/glu] and insulinogenic index [IGI]) between the NGT and late-onset GDM groups. In each group, insulin sensitivity significantly decreased from early to late pregnancy, most in the late-onset GDM group (each p < 0.05). The insulin secretion showed no significant changes with advancing pregnancy in both of the groups, although late-onset GDM showed significantly lower IGI compared with NGT in late OGTT (p < 0.05). When assessed beta cell function by OGTT-derived disposition index (i.e. Insulin Secretion-Sensitivity Index-2 and IGI/fasting insulin), the indices significantly decreased from early to late pregnancy in the both groups (each p < 0.05). Women with late-onset GDM showed significantly lower indices compared with NGT (each p < 0.05). The failure of beta cell to compensate for decreased insulin sensitivity could contribute to the development of the late-onset GDM.
23619284	Tandutinib (MLN518/CT53518) targeted to stem-like cells by inhibiting the function of ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2.	Tandutinib is a novel inhibitor of tyrosine kinases FLT3, PDGFR and KIT. Our study was to explore the capability of tandutinib to reverse ABC transporter-mediated multidrug resistance. Tandutinib reversed ABCG2-mediated drug resistance in ABCG2-482-R2, ABCG2-482-G2, ABCG2-482-T7 and S1-M1-80 cells and increased the accumulation of doxorubicin, rhodamine 123 and [H(3)] mitoxantrone in ABCG2-overexpressing cells. Importantly, tandutinib selectively sensitized side population cells to mitoxantrone. Taken together, our results advocate the potency of tandutinib as an ABCG2 modulator and stem-like cells targeted agent to increase efficiency of anticancer drugs.
23562060	Discovery of ML326: The first sub-micromolar, selective M5 PAM.	This Letter describes the further chemical optimization of the M5 PAM MLPCN probes ML129 and ML172. A multi-dimensional iterative parallel synthesis effort quickly explored isatin replacements and a number of southern heterobiaryl variations with no improvement over ML129 and ML172. An HTS campaign identified several weak M5 PAMs (M5 EC50 >10μM) with a structurally related isatin core that possessed a southern phenethyl ether linkage. While SAR within the HTS series was very shallow and unable to be optimized, grafting the phenethyl ether linkage onto the ML129/ML172 cores led to the first sub-micromolar M5 PAM, ML326 (VU0467903), (human and rat M5 EC50s of 409nM and 500nM, respectively) with excellent mAChR selectivity (M1-M4 EC50s >30μM) and a robust 20-fold leftward shift of the ACh CRC.
23199882	Polymethoxyflavones as agents that prevent formation of cataract: nobiletin congeners show potent growth inhibitory effects in human lens epithelial cells.	Posterior capsular opacification (PCO) is the most frequent complication and the primary reason for visual decrease after extracapsular cataract surgery. The proliferation and migration of leftover lens epithelial cells (LECs) after surgery may contribute to the development of PCO. To prevent PCO, a rational approach would be to inhibit both the proliferation and the migration of LECs using nontoxic xenobiotics. Nobiletin, one of the most abundant polymethoxyflavones (PMFs) in citrus peel, and its synthetic congeners displayed a potent inhibition of LEC proliferation. Structural features which enhance anti-proliferative activity have also been discussed.
23553767	A comparison of bone quality at the distal radius between Asian and Caucasian adolescents and young adults: An HR-pQCT study.	Paradoxically, Asians have lower areal bone mineral density, but their rates of hip and wrist fractures are lower than Caucasians. Therefore, we used high-resolution pQCT (HR-pQCT) to determine whether differences in bone macro- and microstructure, BMD and bone strength at the distal radius are apparent in Asian (n = 91, 53 males, 38 females, 17.3 ± 1.5 yrs) and Caucasian (n = 89, 46 males, 43 females, 18.1 ± 1.8 yrs) adolescents and young adults. HR-pQCT outcomes included total BMD (Tt.BMD), trabecular bone volume fraction (BV/TV), trabecular number (Tb.N), thickness (Tb.Th) and separation (Tb.Sp). We used an automated segmentation algorithm to determine total bone area (Tt.Ar), cortical BMD (Ct.BMD), porosity (Ct.Po) and thickness (Ct.Th), and we applied finite element analysis to HR-pQCT scans to estimate bone strength. We fit sex-specific multivariable regression models to compare bone outcomes between Asians and Caucasians, adjusting for age, age at menarche (girls), lean mass, ulnar length, dietary calcium intake and physical activity. In males, after adjusting for covariates, Asians had 11% greater Tt.BMD, 8% greater Ct.BMD and 25% lower Ct.Po than Caucasians (p < 0.05). Also, Asians had 9% smaller Tt.Ar and 27% greater Ct.Th (p < 0.01). In females, Asians had smaller Tt.Ar than Caucasians (16%, p < 0.001), but this difference was not significant after adjusting for covariates. Asian females had 5% greater Ct.BMD, 12% greater Ct.Th and 11% lower Tb.Sp than Caucasians after adjusting for covariates (p < 0.05). Estimated bone strength did not differ between Asian and Caucasian males or females. Our study supports the notion of compensatory elements of bone structure that sustain bone strength; smaller bones as observed between those of Asian compared with Caucasian origin, have, on average, more dense, less porous and thicker cortices. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether ethnic differences in bone structure exist in childhood, persist into old age and whether they influence fracture risk. © 2013 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.
23561155	Biosynthesis of highly enriched (13)C-lycopene for human metabolic studies using repeated batch tomato cell culturing with (13)C-glucose.	While putative disease-preventing lycopene metabolites are found in both tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) products and in their consumers, mammalian lycopene metabolism is poorly understood. Advances in tomato cell culturing techniques offer an economical tool for generation of highly-enriched (13)C-lycopene for human bioavailability and metabolism studies. To enhance the (13)C-enrichment and yields of labelled lycopene from the hp-1 tomato cell line, cultures were first grown in (13)C-glucose media for three serial batches and produced increasing proportions of uniformly labelled lycopene (14.3±1.2%, 39.6±0.5%, and 48.9±1.5%) with consistent yields (from 5.8 to 9mg/L). An optimised 9-day-long (13)C-loading and 18-day-long labelling strategy developed based on glucose utilisation and lycopene yields, yielded (13)C-lycopene with 93% (13)C isotopic purity, and 55% of isotopomers were uniformly labelled. Furthermore, an optimised acetone and hexane extraction led to a fourfold increase in lycopene recovery from cultures compared to a standard extraction.
20812347	Sorafenib induces growth inhibition and apoptosis of human chondrosarcoma cells by blocking the RAF/ERK/MEK pathway.	BACKGROUND: Chondrosarcoma represents the second most common primary malignant bone tumor causing significant morbidity due to local recurrence and limited treatment options. Conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy has been proven to be largely ineffective to this sarcoma. Here we report that sorafenib is effective in growth inhibition of chondrosarcoma cell lines in vitro. METHODS: Chondrosarcoma cell lines (SW1353 and CRL7891) were treated with sorafenib. Flow cytometry, DAPI assay, and Western blotting were employed to determine the effects of sorafenib in inhibitory proliferation and induce apoptosis in chondrosarcoma cells in vitro. RESULTS: The results showed that sorafenib effectively inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in chondrosarcoma cells, which was concurrent with inhibition of the expression of phospho-MEK and phospho-ERK. Further more the expression levels of cyclin D1, Rb and anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-xl and Mcl-1 significantly reduced, but no changes in Bcl-2 and Bax. We although detected the expression of Akt, JNK, p38 and their respective phosphoprotein, but did not found meaningful changes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that sorafenib inhibited the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway in a time- and dose-dependent fashion in chondrosarcoma cell lines SW1353 and CRL7891 and suggest that sorafenib may be a new therapeutic option for patients with chondrosarcoma.
3004501	Inhibition of the leukotriene synthetase of rat basophil leukemia cells by diethylcarbamazine, and synergism between diethylcarbamazine and piriprost, a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor.	Diethylcarbamazine inhibited the formation of sulfidopeptide leukotrienes in rat basophil leukemia (RBL) cells (50% inhibitory concentration, EC50, 3 mM). Similar concentrations also inhibited the formation of leukotriene C4 (LTC4) by LTC synthetase, a detergent-solubilized cell free particulate enzyme from RBL cells which is capable of coupling LTA4 to glutathione. By contrast, the conversion of LTA4 to LTC4 using enzymes from rat liver was at least ten times less sensitive to this inhibitor. The EC50 for inhibition of the leukotriene C synthetase of RBL cells was directly proportional to the LTA4 concentration in the incubations, ranging from 1.5 mM at 10 microM LTA4 to over 40 mM at 500 microM LTA4. Kinetic analysis revealed that the inhibition of the leukotriene C synthetase reaction by diethylcarbamazine was competitive with respect to LTA4. In contrast to diethylcarbamazine, piriprost (U-60,257; 6,9-deepoxy-6,9-(phenylimino)-delta 6,8-prostaglandin I1), which inhibits the formation of sulfidopeptide leuktrienes in RBL cells at the 5-lipoxygenase step (EC50 5 microM), did not inhibit the leukotriene synthetase of these cells. On the other hand, low concentrations of piriprost, which had no demonstrable inhibitory activity on leukotriene formation by themselves, markedly synergized the inhibitory activity of diethylcarbamazine. These results are consistent with the interpretation that both piriprost and diethylcarbamazine inhibit leukotriene formation but that they act on sequential steps in the biosynthetic pathway in such a manner as to synergistically interfere with the availability or utilization of LTA4 in the leukotriene C synthetase reaction.
15161930	Structural basis for the deactivation of the estrogen-related receptor gamma by diethylstilbestrol or 4-hydroxytamoxifen and determinants of selectivity.	"The estrogen-related receptor (ERR) gamma behaves as a constitutive activator of transcription. Although no natural ligand is known, ERRgamma is deactivated by the estrogen receptor (ER) agonist diethylstilbestrol and the selective ER modulator 4-hydroxytamoxifen but does not significantly respond to estradiol or raloxifene. Here we report the crystal structures of the ERRgamma ligand binding domain (LBD) complexed with diethylstilbestrol or 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Antagonist binding to ERRgamma results in a rotation of the side chain of Phe-435 that partially fills the cavity of the apoLBD. The new rotamer of Phe-435 displaces the ""activation helix"" (helix 12) from the agonist position observed in the absence of ligand. In contrast to the complexes of the ERalpha LBD with 4-hydroxytamoxifen or raloxifene, helix 12 of antagonist-bound ERRgamma does not occupy the coactivator groove but appears to be completely dissociated from the LBD body. Comparison of the ligand-bound LBDs of ERRgamma and ERalpha reveals small but significant differences in the architecture of the ligand binding pockets that result in a slightly shifted binding position of diethylstilbestrol and a small rotation of 4-hydroxytamoxifen in the cavity of ERRgamma relative to ERalpha. Our results provide detailed molecular insight into the conformational changes occurring upon binding of synthetic antagonists to the constitutive orphan receptor ERRgamma and reveal structural differences with ERs that explain why ERRgamma does not bind estradiol or raloxifene and will help to design new selective antagonists."
11979347	Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase genotype, vitamin B12, and folate influence plasma homocysteine in hemodialysis patients.	Hyperhomocysteinemia, a well-recognized cardiovascular risk factor, is frequent in hemodialysis (HD) patients. A common polymorphism in the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene, C-->T substitution at nucleotide 677, is associated with homocysteine (Hcy) level elevation. We examined whether three factors involved in the methionine cycle could influence plasma Hcy concentrations in HD patients: MTHFR polymorphism; vitamin B12, an essential cofactor; and folate, the substrate. In a cross-sectional study, serum vitamin B12, folate, and plasma Hcy were measured and MTHFR genotyping was performed in 534 HD patients. Effects of MTHFR genotypes, vitamin B12, and folate on plasma Hcy levels were examined in 450 HD patients not administered vitamin B12 or folate. To examine the effect of vitamin B12 on plasma Hcy concentrations, we compared plasma Hcy concentrations in HD patients with and without vitamin B12 supplementation. To examine whether functional vitamin B12 deficiency exists even in HD patients with normal vitamin B12 concentrations, 15 HD patients (serum vitamin B12 concentrations, 250 to 2,100 pg/mL) were treated with vitamin B12 (mecobalamin, 1.5 mg/d) for 8 weeks. Serum concentrations of methylmalonic acid (MMA) and vitamin B12 were measured. Hcy levels were higher and folate levels were lower in patients with the TT and CT genotypes compared with patients with the CC genotype. Analysis of covariance to determine independent predictors of high Hcy levels identified low serum vitamin B12 and folate levels and high albumin (Alb) levels in CC-genotype patients, low folate levels and high Alb levels in CT-genotype patients, and low folate levels in TT-genotype patients. Plasma Hcy levels were lower in CC- and CT-genotype patients with vitamin B12 supplementation than in those without supplementation. Vitamin B12 supplementation for 8 weeks significantly reduced MMA concentrations in HD patients with normal serum vitamin B12 concentrations. These results indicate that MTHFR genotype influences the correlation of Hcy level with vitamin B12 and folate levels in HD patients. Functional vitamin B12 deficiency may exist, even in HD patients with normal vitamin B12 concentrations. The efficacy of vitamin B12 and folate supplementation on plasma Hcy levels may depend on MTHFR genotype.
16373326	Isolation and function of the amino acid transporter PAT1 (slc36a1) from rabbit and discrimination between transport via PAT1 and system IMINO in renal brush-border membrane vesicles.	Reabsorption of amino acids is an important function of the renal proximal tubule. pH-dependent amino acid transport has been measured previously using rabbit renal brush-border membrane vesicles (BBMV). The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether this pH-dependent uptake represents H(+)/amino acid cotransport via a PAT1-like transport system. The rabbit PAT1 cDNA was isolated (2296bp including both 5' and 3' untranslated regions and poly(A) tail) and the open reading frame codes for a protein of 475 amino acids (92% identity to human PAT1). Rabbit PAT1 mRNA was found in all tissues investigated including kidney. When expressed heterologously in a mammalian cell line, rabbit PAT1 mediates pH-dependent, Na(+)-independent uptake of proline, glycine, l-alanine and alpha-(methylamino)isobutyric acid. Proline uptake was maximal at pH 5.0 (K(m) 2.2+/-0.7 mM). A transport system with identical characteristics (ion dependency, substrate specificity) was detected in rabbit renal BBMV where an overshoot was observed in the absence of Na+ but in the presence of an inwardly directed H+ gradient. In the presence of Na+ and under conditions in which PAT1 transport function was suppressed, a second proline uptake system was detected that exhibited functional characteristics similar to those of the IMINO system. The functional characteristics of rabbit PAT1 in either mammalian cells or renal BBMV suggest that PAT1 is the low-affinity transporter of proline, glycine and hydroxyproline believed to be defective in patients with iminoglycinuria.
16595573	Hepatic veno-occlusive disease associated with immunosuppressive cyclophosphamide dosing and roxithromycin.	OBJECTIVE: To report on a patient developing hepatic veno-occlusive disease while being treated with immunosuppressive doses of cyclophosphamide (< or =2 mg/kg). CASE SUMMARY: A 66-year-old woman with autoimmune hemolytic anemia developed hepatic veno-occlusive disease while being treated with immunosuppressive cyclophosphamide 100 mg/day in combination with roxithromycin (total dose 600 mg/day). After all drugs were stopped, the patient recovered within 2 weeks. The Naranjo probability scale indicated a probable relationship between veno-occlusive disease and treatment with cyclophosphamide in this patient. DISCUSSION: Since roxithromycin inhibits CYP3A4, which is involved with cyclophosphamide metabolism, a drug-drug interaction could have been responsible. In addition, roxithromycin is an inhibitor of the drug transporter P-glycoprotein, possibly leading to accumulation of cyclophosphamide in endothelial cells. Alternatively, since cyclophosphamide has been reported to induce apoptosis, roxithromycin could have rendered endothelial cells more vulnerable for apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: In specific patients, cyclophosphamide can be associated with hepatic veno-occlusive disease at immunosuppressive doses.
23587660	Effect of Korean pear (Pyruspyrifolia cv. Shingo) juice on hangover severity following alcohol consumption.	Korean pear has been used as a traditional prophylactic agent for alcohol hangover. However, its mechanism was not investigated in human yet. Therefore, we performed a randomized single blind crossover trial with 14 healthy young men to examine effects of Korean pear juice on alcohol hangover. All subjects consumed 540ml of spirits (alcohol conc. 20.1v/v%) after 30min from the intervention, i.e. placebo or Korean pear juice treatment. Blood and urine specimens were collected in time-courses (9 time-points for 15h after alcohol consumption). The total and average of hangover severity were alleviated to 16% and 21% by Korean pear juice at 15h after the alcohol consumption (ps<0.05). Particularly, 'trouble concentrating' was significantly improved by the pear juice treatment (p<0.05). Impaired memory, sensitivity to light and sound, and mean of hangover severity were significantly improved by Korean pear juice among the subjects with ALDH2*1/*1 or ALDH2*1/*2 genotypes (ps<0.05) but not in the subjects with ALDH2*2/*2 genotype. In addition, the pear juice treatment lowered levels of blood alcohol (p<0.01). Therefore, Korean pear juice may alleviate alcohol-hangover and its detoxification of alcohol seems to be modified by the genetic variation of ALDH2.
23562072	Altered cholesterol homeostasis in aged macrophages linked to neovascular macular degeneration.	Abnormal lipid metabolism has been linked to age-related macular degeneration (AMD); choroidal neovascularization in late AMD commonly causes blindness. Sene et al. (2013) now demonstrate that in aged macrophages decreased ABCA1 expression, regulated by liver X receptor and miR-33, impairs export of intracellular cholesterol, which promotes neovascular AMD.
6687626	Deduced amino acid sequence from the bovine oxytocin-neurophysin I precursor cDNA.	The nonapeptide hormone oxytocin-like arginine-vasopressin (AVP) is synthesized as part of a larger precursor polypeptide. The precursor also includes the neurophysin molecule with which the hormone is associated in the neurosecretory granules of the hypothalamo-pituitary tract. A protein of molecular weight (Mr) approximately 20,000 has been isolated from supraoptic nuclei of rat hypothalami which, after tryptic cleavage, released a neurophysin-like molecule of Mr approximately 10,000 and an oligopeptide related to oxytocin. This result was complemented by in vitro translation of bovine hypothalamic mRNA. Among the primary translation products a single polypeptide of Mr approximately 16,500 was shown to contain antigenic determinants recognized by specific antisera against bovine neurophysin I and oxytocin. Here we report the amino acid sequence of the bovine oxytocin-neurophysin I (OT-NpI) precursor which was derived from sequence analysis of the cloned cDNA. As is the case for the bovine arginine-vasopressin-neurophysin II (AVP-NpII) precursor, the signal sequence of the OT-NpI precursor is immediately followed by the nonapeptide hormone which is connected to neurophysin I by a Gly-Lys-Arg sequence. A striking feature of the nucleic acid sequence is the 197-nucleotide long perfect homology with the AVP-NpII precursor mRNA sequence encoding the conserved middle part of neurophysins I and II.
23406025	In vitro polyphenolics erythrocyte model and in vivo chicken embryo model revealed gallic acid to be a potential hemorrhage inducer: physicochemical action mechanisms.	The in vivo chicken embryo model (CEM) demonstrated that gallic acid (GA) induced dysvascularization and hypoxia. Inflammatory edema, Zenker's necrosis, hemolysis, and liposis of cervical muscles were the common symptoms. Levels of the gene hif-1α, HIF-1α, TNF-α, IL-6, and NFκB in cervical muscles were all significantly upregulated, while the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was downregulated in a dose-responsive manner. Consequently, the cervical muscle inflammation and hemolysis could have been stimulated en route to the tissue TNF-α-canonical and the atypical pathways. We hypothesized that GA could deplete the dissolved oxygen (DO) at the expense of semiquinone and quinone formation, favoring the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production to induce RBC disruption and Fe(2+) ion release. To explore this, the in vitro polyphenolics-erythrocyte model (PEM) was established. PEM revealed that the DO was rapidly depleted, leading to the release of a huge amount of Fe (II) ions and hydrogen peroxide (HPO) in a two-phase kinetic pattern. The kinetic coefficients for Fe (II) ion release ranged from 0.347 h(-1) to 0.774 h(-1); and those for Fe (III) ion production were from 6.66 × 10(-3) h(-1) to 8.93 × 10(-3) h(-1). For phase I HPO production, they ranged from 0.236 h(-1) to 0.774 h(-1) and for phase II HPO production from 0.764 h(-1) to 2.560 h(-1) at GA within 6 μM to 14 μM. Thus, evidence obtained from PEM could strongly support the phenomena of CEM. To conclude, GA tends to elicit hypoxia-related inflammation and hemolysis in chicken cervical muscles through its extremely high prooxidant activity.
23007555	Effect of ifenprodil on GluN1/GluN2B N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor gating.	Ifenprodil is an allosteric inhibitor of GluN1/GluN2B N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Despite its widespread use as a prototype for drug development and a subtype-selective tool for physiologic experiments, its precise effect on GluN1/GluN2B gating is yet to be fully understood. Interestingly, recent crystallographic evidence identified that ifenprodil, unlike zinc, binds at the interface of the GluN1/GluN2B amino terminal domain dimer by an induced-fit mechanism. To delineate the effect of this unique binding on GluN1/GluN2B receptor gating, we recorded steady-state currents from cell-attached and outside-out patches. At pH 7.9 in cell-attached patches, ifenprodil increased the occupancy of the long-lived shut conformations, thereby reducing the open probability of the receptor with no change in the mean open time. In addition, ifenprodil selectively affected the area of shut time constants, but not the time constants themselves. Kinetic analyses suggested that ifenprodil prevents the transition of the receptor to an open state and increases its dwell time in an intrinsically occurring closed conformation or desensitized state. We found distinct differences in the action of ifenprodil at GluN1/GluN2B in comparison with previous studies on the effect of zinc on GluN1/GluN2A gating, which may arise due to their unique binding sites. Our data also uncover the potential pH-dependent action of ifenprodil on gating. At a low pH (pH 7.4), but not pH 7.9, ifenprodil reduces the mean open time of GluN1/GluN2B receptors, which may be responsible for its usefulness as a context-dependent inhibitor in conditions like ischemia and stroke, when the pH of the extracellular milieu becomes acidic.
10991997	Bupropion is a nicotinic antagonist.	Neuronal nicotinic receptors are ligand-gated ion channels of the central and peripheral central nervous system that regulate synaptic activity from both pre- and postsynaptic sites. The present study establishes the acute interaction of bupropion, an antidepressant agent that is also effective in nicotine dependence, with nicotine and nicotinic receptors using different in vivo and in vitro tests. Bupropion was found to block nicotine's antinociception (in two tests), motor effects, hypothermia, and convulsive effects with different potencies in the present investigation, suggesting that bupropion possesses some selectivity for neuronal nicotinic receptors underlying these various nicotinic effects. In addition, bupropion blocks nicotine activation of alpha(3)beta(2), alpha(4)beta(2), and alpha(7) neuronal acetylcholine nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) with some degree of selectivity. It was approximately 50 and 12 times more effective in blocking alpha(3)beta(2) and alpha(4)beta(2) than alpha(7.) This functional blockade was noncompetitive, because it was insurmountable by increasing concentration of ACh in the nAChRs subtypes tested. Furthermore, bupropion at high concentration failed to displace brain [(3)H]nicotine binding sites, a site largely composed of alpha(4)beta(2) subunit combination. Given the observation that bupropion inhibition of alpha(3)beta(2) and alpha(4)beta(2) receptors exhibits voltage-independence properties, bupropion may not be acting as an open channel blocker. These effects may explain in part bupropion's efficacy in nicotine dependence. Our present findings suggest that functional blockade of neuronal nAChRs are useful in nicotine dependence treatment.
23465612	Structure-based design of novel dihydroisoquinoline BACE-1 inhibitors that do not engage the catalytic aspartates.	The structure-activity relationship of a series of dihydroisoquinoline BACE-1 inhibitors is described. Application of structure-based design to screening hit 1 yielded sub-micromolar inhibitors. Replacement of the carboxylic acid of 1 was guided by X-ray crystallography, which allowed the replacement of a key water-mediated hydrogen bond. This work culminated in compounds such as 31, which possess good BACE-1 potency, excellent permeability and a low P-gp efflux ratio.
23448129	Glutathione dimerization-based plasmonic nanoswitch for biodetection of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species.	Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) are continuously produced in the cellular systems and are controlled by several antioxidant mechanisms. Here, we developed a straightforward, sensitive, and quantitative assay for the colorimetric and spectroscopic detection of various ROS and RNS such as H2O2, ·OH, (-)OCl, NO·, and O2(-) using glutathione-modified gold nanoparticles (GSH-AuNPs). A basic principle here is that the GSHs on the AuNP surface can be readily detached via the formation of glutathione disulfides upon the addition of ROS and RNS, and destabilized particles can aggregate to generate the plasmonic couplings between plasmonic AuNPs that trigger the red shift in UV-vis spectrum and solution color change. For nonradical species such as H2O2, this process can be more efficiently achieved by converting them into radical species via the Fenton reaction. Using this strategy, we were able to rapidly and quantitatively distinguish among cancerous and normal cells based on ROS and RNS production.
17561443	Differential expression profiles of antioxidant enzymes and glutathione redox status in hyperthyroid rats: a temporal analysis.	Our objective was to elucidate a temporal profile of expression of antioxidant enzymes (AOEs) and glutathione redox status in rat liver under the influence of thyroid hormone (T3). The key AOEs, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx-1) and glutathione reductase (GR) were characterized at transcriptional, translational and biochemical levels after 24 h, 72 h and 120 h of treatment. In general, catalase and GPx-1 showed opposite responses in both transcription and translation. T3 treatment caused tightly coordinated downregulation of catalase. However, transcriptional changes of other AOEs over the different durations of treatment were not always reflected in their respective protein and/or activity levels. Discordance among transcripts, proteins and biological activities of AOEs suggested differential regulation by T3 at multiple levels. Reduced and oxidized glutathione were depleted in hyperthyroid rats. Though T3 exerted a positive stimulatory effect on glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, it was not sufficient to compensate for massive glutathione depletion and impaired activities of GPx-1, GR and GST, disturbing the cellular redox status in the process. Apparently, while transcriptional induction of AOEs might be adaptive responses in conditions of oxidative stress, yet post-transcriptional regulation appeared to be the predominant mechanism of regulation of AOE expression.
16818496	Pharmacogenetics of anticancer drug sensitivity in pancreatic cancer.	Chemotherapy has produced unsatisfactory results in pancreas cancer and novel approaches, including treatment tailoring by pharmacogenetic analysis and new molecular-targeted drugs, are required. The scarcity of effective therapies may reflect the lack of knowledge about the influence of tumor-related molecular abnormalities on responsiveness to drugs. Advances in the understanding of pancreas cancer biology have been made over the past decade, including the discovery of critical mutations in oncogenes (i.e., K-Ras) as well as the loss of tumor suppressor genes, such as TP53 and p16(INK4). Other studies showed the dysregulation of the expression of proteins involved in the control of cell cycle, proliferation, apoptosis, and invasiveness, such as Bcl-2, Akt, mdm2, and epidermal growth factor receptor. These characteristics might contribute to the aggressive behavior of pancreatic cancer and influence response to treatment. Indeed, the inactivation of p53 may explain the relative resistance to 5-fluorouracil, whereas Bcl-2 overexpression is associated with reduced sensitivity to gemcitabine. However, the future challenge of pancreas cancer chemotherapy relies on the identification of molecular markers that help in the selection of drugs best suited to the individual patient. Recent pharmacogenetic studies focused on genes encoding proteins directly involved in drug activity, showing the role of thymidylate synthase and human equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1 as prognostic factor in 5-fluorouracil- and gemcitabine-treated patients, respectively. Finally, inhibitors of signal transduction and angiogenesis are under extensive investigation, and several prospective trials have been devoted to this area. Pharmacogenetics is likely to play a central role in the personalization of treatment, to stratify patients based on their likelihood of response to both standard agents (i.e., gemcitabine/nucleoside transporters) and targeted treatments (i.e., epidermal growth factor receptor gene mutations and/or amplification and tyrosine kinase inhibitors), Thus, molecular analysis should be implemented in the optimal management of the patient affected by pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
23223345	The Effects of Carbohydrate, Unsaturated Fat, and Protein Intake on Measures of Insulin Sensitivity: Results from the OmniHeart Trial.	OBJECTIVE Impaired insulin sensitivity increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. Although calorie restriction and weight loss increase insulin sensitivity, the effects of modifying macronutrient composition on insulin sensitivity are uncertain. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects on insulin sensitivity of a carbohydrate-rich diet (CARB; similar to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension [DASH] diet), a protein-rich diet (PROT; protein predominantly from plant sources), and an unsaturated fat-rich diet (UNSAT; predominantly monounsaturated). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This study was a randomized, controlled, three-period, crossover feeding study. The study participants were 164 individuals with prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension without diabetes. Diets were administered for 6 weeks each, with a washout period between diets of 2-4 weeks. Weight was held constant throughout the study. For our primary outcome, we calculated the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) using the end-of-period fasting serum glucose and insulin. QUICKI is a validated measure of insulin sensitivity. The primary analyses used generalized estimating equations. RESULTS At baseline, mean (SD) BMI was 30.2 (6.1) kg/m(2), and mean (SD) QUICKI was 0.35 (0.04). The UNSAT diet increased QUICKI by 0.005, more than the CARB diet (P = 0.04). PROT had no significant effect compared with CARB. CONCLUSIONS A diet that partially replaces carbohydrate with unsaturated fat may improve insulin sensitivity in a population at risk for cardiovascular disease. Given the well-recognized challenges of sustaining weight loss, our results suggest an alternative approach for improving insulin sensitivity.
23414235	Vegfrecine, an Inhibitor of VEGF Receptor Tyrosine Kinases Isolated from the Culture Broth of Streptomyces sp.	A new inhibitor of VEGF receptor tyrosine kinases, vegfrecine (1), was isolated from the culture broth of Streptomyces sp. MK931-CF8. The molecular structure of 1 was determined by NMR and MS analysis combined with synthesis. Compound 1 showed potent inhibitory activity against vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinases in in vitro enzyme assays, but platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) responded only weakly. Compound 1 is a promising new selective VEGFR inhibitor for investigating new treatments of cancer and inflammatory diseases.
15367040	Psychopharmacology of anticonvulsants: levetiracetam as a synaptic vesicle protein modulator.	ISSUE: A novel mechanism of action has recently been described for levetiracetam, a member of a new class of anticonvulsants. Levetiracetam binds selectively and with high affinity to a synaptic vesicle protein known as SV2A, thought to be involved with synaptic vesicle exocytosis and presynaptic neurotransmitter release.
11374034	Role of vitamin K and vitamin K-dependent proteins in vascular calcification.	OBJECTIVES: To provide a rational basis for recommended daily allowances (RDA) of dietary phylloquinone (vitamin K1) and menaquinone (vitamin K2) intake that adequately supply extrahepatic (notably vascular) tissue requirements. BACKGROUND: Vitamin K has a key function in the synthesis of at least two proteins involved in calcium and bone metabolism, namely osteocalcin and matrix Gla-protein (MGP). MGP was shown to be a strong inhibitor of vascular calcification. Present RDA values for vitamin K are based on the hepatic phylloquinone requirement for coagulation factor synthesis. Accumulating data suggest that extrahepatic tissues such as bone and vessel wall require higher dietary intakes and have a preference for menaquinone rather than for phylloquinone. METHODS: Tissue-specific vitamin K consumption under controlled intake was determined in warfarin-treated rats using the vitamin K-quinone/epoxide ratio as a measure for vitamin K consumption. Immunohistochemical analysis of human vascular material was performed using a monoclonal antibody against MGP. The same antibody was used for quantification of MGP levels in serum. RESULTS: At least some extrahepatic tissues including the arterial vessel wall have a high preference for accumulating and using menaquinone rather than phylloquinone. Both intima and media sclerosis are associated with high tissue concentrations of MGP, with the most prominent accumulation at the interface between vascular tissue and calcified material. This was consistent with increased concentrations of circulating MGP in subjects with atherosclerosis and diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report demonstrating the association between MGP and vascular calcification. The hypothesis is put forward that undercarboxylation of MGP is a risk factor for vascular calcification and that the present RDA values are too low to ensure full carboxylation of MGP.
17102120	Does the expression of c-kit (CD117) in neuroendocrine tumors represent a target for therapy?	Neuroendocrine tumors are very heterogeneous, develop from a variety of tissues, and can be difficult to diagnose. Without the clinical manifestation of metastases, it is often difficult to characterize them as malignant. Even so-called completely (R0) resected tumors can spread clinically visible metastases within a few months after initial surgery. Treatment options for neuroendocrine tumors including pheochromocytoma are limited. Molecular targeted therapies using tyrosine kinase inhibitors might prove to be helpful in patients with these tumors. In an immunohistochemical study, we examined KIT in 26 pheochromocytomas, 8 of which were malignant (3 adrenal pheochromocytomas, 5 paragangliomas). KIT expression was found in one of these 8 malignant tumors. This 2.5-cm-large adrenal pheochromocytoma originated from a woman with neurofibromatosis type 1 and spread into spine, skull, and lung. KIT expression could be demonstrated in 5% of tumor cells. On the basis of KIT expression immunohistochemically, we treated patients with neuroendocrine (i.e., medullary thyroid cancer) and other tumors with imatinib 400 mg per day, but without efficacy after 2 months of therapy. Similar results were shown by other investigators. Therefore, monotherapy with imatinib may not be efficacious in patients with neuroendocrine tumors that express KIT. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as sorafenib that targets several receptors in addition to KIT may be more efficacious in treating patients with neuroendocrine tumors.
23363576	Hepatoprotective effect of carob against acute ethanol-induced oxidative stress in rat.	The present study was undertaken to determine whether subacute treatment with aqueous extract of carob (Ceratonia siliqua L.) pods (AECPs) protects against ethanol (EtOH)-induced oxidative stress in rat liver. Animals were divided into four groups: control, carob, EtOH and EtOH + carob. Wistar rats were intraperitoneally pretreated with AECP (600 mg/kg body weight (bw)) during 7 days and intoxicated for 6 h by acute oral administration of EtOH (6 g/kg bw) 24 h after the last injection. We found that acute administration of EtOH leads to hepatotoxicity as monitored by the increase in the levels of hepatic marker aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase as well as hepatic tissue injury. EtOH also increased the formation of malondialdehyde in the liver, indicating an increase in lipid peroxidation and depletion of antioxidant enzyme activities as superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase. Subacute carob pretreatment prevented all the alterations induced by EtOH and returned their levels to near normal. Importantly, we showed that acute alcohol increased hepatic and plasmatic hydrogen peroxide and free iron levels. The carob pretreatment reversed EtOH effects to near control levels. These data suggest that carob could have a beneficial effect in inhibiting the oxidative damage induced by acute EtOH administration and that its mode of action may involve an opposite effect on plasma and tissue-free iron accumulation. Indeed, carob can be offered as a food additive to protect against EtOH-induced oxidative damage.
15880981	Brugada syndrome--an update.	A diagnostic triad characterizes Brugada syndrome. It consists of a right bundle branch block, ST-segment elevation in leads V1-V3 and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Approximately 50% of patients with Brugada syndrome noted to have familial occurrence, this suggests a genetic component of the disease. Mutations in gene SCN5A, an encoder for human cardiac sodium channel on chromosome 3p21, causes Brugada syndrome. Before considering the diagnosis of Brugada syndrome, exclude precordial ST-segment elevation secondary to acute coronary syndrome, electrolyte imbalance, myocarditis, drug over dosage (cocaine, tricyclic antidepressants), and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia. Intravenous administration of ajmaline, flecainide, and procainamide may exaggerate the ST-segment elevation, or unmask it when it is initially absent in patients with suspected Brugada syndrome. Programmed electrical stimulation (PES) may help in risk stratification, and in some cases, establish the diagnosis. However, the accuracy of PES in predicting outcome is debatable, especially in patients showing an asymptomatic Brugada ECG, and reporting no family history of SCD. Treatment with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is the only established effective therapy for the disease. With ICD therapy, the mortality rate at a 10 year follow-up was 0%. Supporting data for long-term pharmacological therapy with quinidine, or isoproterenol for prevention of SCD, in these patients, is uncomplete. Future advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms of Brugada syndrome may provide answers to many of the controversial issues in the management of this disease.
10373451	Cloning and characterization of a novel human phosphodiesterase that hydrolyzes both cAMP and cGMP (PDE10A).	cDNA encoding a novel phosphodiesterase (PDE) was isolated from a human fetal lung cDNA library and designated PDE10A. The deduced amino acid sequence contains 779 amino acids, including a putative cGMP binding sequence in the amino-terminal portion of the molecule and a catalytic domain that is 16-47% identical in amino acid sequence to those of other PDE families. Recombinant PDE10A transfected and expressed in COS-7 cells hydrolyzed cAMP and cGMP with Km values of 0.26 and 7.2 microM, respectively, and Vmax with cGMP was almost twice that with cAMP. Of the PDE inhibitors tested, dipyridamole was most effective, with IC50 values of 1.2 and 0.45 microM for inhibition of cAMP and cGMP hydrolysis, respectively. cGMP inhibited hydrolysis of cAMP, and cAMP inhibited cGMP hydrolysis with IC50 values of 14 and 0.39 microM, respectively. Thus, PDE10A exhibited properties of a cAMP PDE and a cAMP-inhibited cGMP PDE. PDE10A transcripts were particularly abundant in the putamen and caudate nucleus regions of brain and in thyroid and testis, and in much lower amounts in other tissues. The PDE10A gene was located on chromosome 6q26 by fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis. PDE10A represents a new member of the PDE superfamily, exhibiting unique kinetic properties and inhibitor sensitivity.
23301856	In vitro evaluation of (99m)Tc-EDDA/tricine-HYNIC-Q-Litorin in gastrin-releasing peptide receptor positive tumor cell lines.	Abstract Bombesin and its derivatives exhibit a high affinity for gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPr), which is over-expressed in a variety of human cancers (prostate, pancreatic, lung, etc.). The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro potential of the hydrazinonicotinamide (HYNIC)-Q-Litorin. (99m)Tc labeling was performed by using different co-ligands: tricine and ethylenediamine diacetic acid (EDDA). The radiochemical stability of radiolabeled peptide conjugates was checked at room temperature and in cysteine solution up to 24 h. The in vitro cell uptake of (99m)Tc-EDDA-HYNIC-Q-Litorin and (99m)Tc-tricine-HYNIC-Q-Litorin were evaluated on pancreatic tumor and control cell lines. Optimum specific activity and incubation time were determined for all the cell lines. The results showed that the cell uptake of the radiolabeled peptide conjugates in tumor cell lines were higher than in the control cell line. The findings of this study indicated the need for further development of in vivo study as a radiopharmaceutical for pancreatic tumor imaging.
23453838	Synthesis and anti-acetylcholinesterase properties of novel β- and γ-substituted alkoxy organophosphonates.	Activated organophosphate (OP) insecticides and chemical agents inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) to form OP-AChE adducts. Whereas the structure of the OP correlates with the rate of inhibition, the structure of the OP-AChE adduct influences the rate at which post-inhibitory reactivation or aging phenomena occurs. In this report, we prepared a panel of β-substituted ethoxy and γ-substituted propoxy phosphonoesters of the type p-NO(2)PhO-P(X)(R)[(O(CH(2))(n)Z] (R=Me, Et; X=O, S; n=2, 3; Z=halogen, OTs) and examined the inhibition of three AChEs by select structures in the panel. The β-fluoroethoxy methylphosphonate analog (R=Me, Z=F, n=2) was the most potent anti-AChE compound comparable (ki ∼6 × 10(6)M(-1)min(-1)) to paraoxon against EEAChE. Analogs with Z=Br, I, or OTs were weak inhibitors of the AChEs, and methyl phosphonates (R=Me) were more potent than the corresponding ethyl phosphonates (R=Et). As expected, analogs with a thionate linkage (PS) were poor inhibitors of the AChEs.
17588737	Apoptosis induced by oxidized lipids is associated with up-regulation of p66Shc in intestinal Caco-2 cells: protective effects of phenolic compounds.	In this study, we investigated the alterations of the redox balance induced by the lipid fraction of oxLDL in Caco-2 intestinal cells, and the effects of tyrosol and protocatechuic acid, two dietary phenolic compounds. We found that oxidized lipids extracted from oxLDL (LipE) induced oxidative stress by determining, 6 h after treatment, ROS overproduction (about a 100% and a 43% increase of O*2 and H2O2 production, respectively, P<.05: LipE vs. control) and, 12 h after treatment, GSH depletion (about a 26% decrease, P<.05: LipE vs. control), and by impairing the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase. In response to the induced oxidative stress, we observed significant overexpression of glutathione peroxidase (6 h after treatment: P<.05), glutathione reductase and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (12 h after treatment: P<.05). Notably, when GSH depletion occurred, p66Shc protein expression increased by about 300% with respect to control (P<.001; LipE vs. control). These effects were fully counteracted by dietary phenolics which inhibited ROS overproduction and GSH consumption, rendered the reactive transcription of glutathione-associated enzymes unnecessary and blocked the intracellular signals leading to the overexpression and rearrangement of p66Shc signalling molecule. Altogether, these results suggest that the impairment of the antioxidant system hijacks intestinal cells towards an apoptotic-prone phenotype via the activation of p66Shc molecule. They also propose a reappraisal of dietary polyphenols as intestinal protecting agents, indicating the antiapoptotic effect as a further mechanism of action of these antioxidant compounds.
23218712	Discovery of a novel phenylethyl benzamide glucokinase activator for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.	Novel benzamide derivatives were synthesized and tested at in vitro assay by measuring fold increase of glucokinase activity at 5.0 mM glucose concentration. Among the prepared compounds, YH-GKA was found to be an active glucokinase activator with EC(50) of 70 nM. YH-GKA showed similar glucose AUC reduction of 29.6% (50 mg/kg) in an OGTT study with C57BL/J6 mice compared to 29.9% for metformin (300 mg/kg). Acute treatment of the compound in C57BL/J6 and ob/ob mice elicited basal glucose lowering activity. In subchronic study with ob/ob mice, YH-GKA showed significant decrease in blood glucose levels and no adverse effects on serum lipids or body weight. In addition, YH-GKA exhibited high bioavailability and moderate elimination in preclinical species.
17932689	Effect of the ABCB1 modulators elacridar and tariquidar on the distribution of paclitaxel in nude mice.	PURPOSE: Previously, we studied the effect of co-administration of paclitaxel with the second generation ABCB1 (p-gp) modulator valspodar on the intracerebral growth of human U118-MG glioblastoma in nude mice. Valspodar significantly increased the brain levels of paclitaxel by inhibition of p-gp expressed at the blood brain barrier. Thus, the tumour burden was reduced by 90%, which was considered as a proof of concept. However, the paclitaxel dose had to be reduced because of toxic side effects resulting from increased drug levels due to p-gp modulation in peripheral tissues. Therefore, in the present study we examined the co-application of paclitaxel with the third generation ABCB1 modulators elacridar and tariquidar, which were supposed to preferentially modulate p-gp in brain capillaries. METHODS: The inhibitory activity of the modulators was measured by a flow cytometric and a chemosensitivity assay in vitro. To determine the distribution of paclitaxel in vivo, nude mice received 50 mg/kg of valspodar, elacridar or tariquidar p.o. (control: vehicle) 4 h before i.v. injection of 8 mg/kg of paclitaxel. Brain, liver, kidney and plasma were collected and analyzed by RP-HPLC. RESULTS: Our in vitro experiments demonstrate that the new modulators are about 80 times more effective in comparison to valspodar. Co-administration of paclitaxel with elacridar and tariquidar led to a long lasting fivefold increase in the concentration of the cytostatic in the brain. Although the increase (2.5- to 7-fold) tended to be lower compared to that induced by co-administered valspodar (six- to eightfold), the brain/plasma ratios achieved with the new modulators were 2-15 times higher. CONCLUSIONS: Elacridar and tariquidar seem to modulate p-glycoprotein preferentially at the blood-brain barrier. Our results suggest that the systemic toxicity of cytostatics combined with elacridar or tariquidar should be lower than in combination with valspodar.
23623838	Maternal nicotine exposure during lactation alters hypothalamic neuropeptides expression in the adult rat progeny.	Maternal exposure to nicotine during lactation causes hyperleptinemia in the pups and, at adulthood, these animals are overweight and hyperleptinemic, while, in their hypothalamus, the leptin signaling pathway is reduced, evidencing a central leptin resistance. Then, we evaluated the expression of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH), cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), neuropeptide Y (NPY), agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and others in different hypothalamic nuclei in order to better understand the mechanisms underlying the obese phenotype observed in these animals at adulthood. On the 2nd postnatal day (P2), dams were subcutaneously implanted with osmotic minipumps releasing nicotine (NIC-6mg/kg/day) or saline for 14days. Offspring were killed in P180 and immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis were carried out. Significance data had p<0.05. Adult NIC offspring showed more intense NPY staining in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) (+21%) and increased number of POMC-positive cells in the: arcuate nucleus (+33%), as an increase in fiber density of α-MSH in PVN (+85%). However, the number of CART-positive cells was reduced in the PVN (-25%). CRH staining was more intense in NIC offspring (+136%). Orexins and AgRP were not altered. Thus, maternal nicotine exposure changes hypothalamic neuropeptides in the adult progeny that is partially compatible with leptin resistance.
23481176	Efficient MRI labeling of endothelial progenitor cells: Design of thiolated surface stabilized superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles.	The aim of this study was to design thiolated surface stabilized superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (TSS-SPIONs) for efficient internalization with high MRI sensitivity. TSS-SPIONs were developed by chelation between thiolated chitosan-thioglycolic acid (chitosan-TGA) hydrogel and iron ions (Fe(2+)/Fe(3+)). Likely, unmodified chitosan hydrogel SPIONs (UC-SPIONs) and uncoated SPIONs were used as control. Moreover, TSS-SPIONs were investigated regarding to their iron core size, hydrodynamic diameter, zeta potential, iron contents, molar relaxivities (r1 and r2), and cellular internalization. TSS-SPIONs demonstrated an iron oxide core diameter (crystallite size by XRD) of 3.1±0.02nm, a hydrodynamic diameter of 94±20nm, a zeta potential of +21±5mV, and an iron content of 3.6±0.9mg/mL. In addition, internalization of TSS-SPIONs into human endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) from umbilical cord blood was more than threefold and 17-fold higher in contrast to UC-SPIONs and SPIONs, respectively. With twofold lower incubation iron concentration of TSS-SPIONs, more than threefold higher internalization was achieved as compared to Resovist®. Also, cell viability of more than 90% was observed in the presence of TSS-SPIONs after 24h. The molar MR relaxivities (r2) value at 1.5T was threefold higher than that of Resovist® and demonstrated that TSS-SPIONs have the potential as very effective T2 contrast-enhancement agent. According to these findings, TSS-SPIONs with efficient internalization, lower cytotoxicity, and high MRI sensitivity seem to be promising for cell tracking.
1663395	The microsomal/peroxidase antigen: modulation of its expression in thyroid cells.	"Evidence has accumulated in the last few years that the expression of the microsomal/peroxidase antigen (M/TPO-Ag) in thyroid cells is induced by TSH, through pathways which involve intracellular cAMP accumulation and protein synthesis. These data have been found true in any thyroid system studied so far, both in terms of immunologic and enzymatic activity of TPO. TSH and cAMP also increase the levels of the specific mRNA for TPO in thyroid cells from different species. Whether this phenomenon is due to a direct transcriptional regulation of the TPO gene, as shown in dog thyroid cells, or to posttranscriptional effects, as it would appear in FRTL-5 cells, remains to be clarified by future experiments. Thyroid stimulating antibody (TSAb) of Graves' disease also stimulates the expression of M/TPO-Ag. This finding gives further support to the relevance of TSAb in the pathogenesis of hyperthyroidism and explains the well known observation that the ""microsomal"" antigen is particularly abundant in glands of Graves' patients. The modulation of M/TPO-Ag surface expression by TSH can explain the decrease of circulating anti-MAb observed during L-thyroxine therapy in hypothyroid patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Other agents, such as methimazole and sodium iodide, which influence thyroid cell function, do not directly interfere with the expression of M/TPO-Ag. Cytokines, such as gamma-interferon, interleukin-1, and interleukin-6 have been shown to inhibit the TSH-induced increase of TPO mRNA, but further investigations are required to elucidate the exact role of cytokines in the regulation of M/TPO-Ag expression."
15909120	Estrogen protects primary osteocytes against glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis.	Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis may be at least in part due to the increased apoptosis of osteocytes. To study the role of osteocyte apoptosis in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, we isolated primary osteocytes from murine calvaria for the analysis of the effects of dexamethasone in in vitro culture. The cells were identified by morphology, cytochemical staining, immunocytochemical staining and mRNA expression of phosphate-regulating gene with homology to endopeptidases on the X chromosome (PHEX) and sclerosteosis/van Buchem disease gene (SOST). We found that dexamethasone induced osteocyte apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. A glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, mifepristone (RU486), suppressed dexamethasone-induced osteocyte apoptosis, suggesting that it was mediated by glucocorticoid receptor. Immunocytochemical stainings showed that glucocorticoid receptors are present in primary osteocytes, and they were translocated to nuclei after the exposure to dexamethasone. Addition of estrogen prevented glucocorticoid receptor translocation into nuclei. Corresponding antiapoptotic effects in primary osteocytes were also seen after the pretreatment of primary osteocytes with a picomolar concentration of estrogen. The pure antiestrogen ICI 182,780 inhibited estrogen effect on apoptosis induced by dexamethasone. These data suggest that glucocorticoid receptors play an important role in glucocorticoid-induced osteocyte apoptosis. Most importantly, estrogen has a protective effect against osteocyte apoptosis. To conclude, the mechanism of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis may be due to the apoptosis of osteocytes, which can be opposed by estrogen.
12453616	Methamphetamine increases the hippocampal alpha(2A)-adrenergic receptor and Galpha(o) in mice.	This study investigates the involvement of alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors (AR) in mouse brain induced by a low dose of methamphetamine (METH, 2 mg/kg). Immunohistochemical studies show that alpha(2A)-AR increased in the dentate gyrus area of the hippocampus 24 h after five repeated administrations of METH. The hippocampal alpha(2A)-AR proteins rose 3.2-fold when compared to the saline-administered mice. The other adrenergic receptor, alpha(1D)-AR, were not changed by the treatment. Moreover, alpha(o)-subunits of GTP-binding proteins (Galpha(o)), one of the downstream molecules of alpha(2A)-AR, was also increased by the treatment. These suggest that the repeated administration of low-doses of METH causes quantitative changes of the signaling of alpha(2A)-AR in the mouse hippocampus.
23225780	N-cyano sulfoximines: COX inhibition, anticancer activity, cellular toxicity, and mutagenicity.	From insects to cancer: N-Cyano sulfoximines were evaluated for COX inhibition and antiproliferative activity against a panel of cancer cell lines. The most active compound exhibited potent COX-2 inhibition, some selectivity for COX-2 over COX-1, only slight cytotoxicity towards healthy cells (HaCaT skin cells), and no mutagenic potential (as determined by an Ames assay).
10939639	Schisandrin B protects against menadione-induced hepatotoxicity by enhancing DT-diaphorase activity.	Pretreating mice with schisandrin B (Sch B), a dibenzocyclooctadiene derivative isolated from the fruit of Schisandra chinensis, at a daily dose of 1 mmol/kg for 3 days protected against menadione-induced hepatic oxidative damage in mice, as evidenced by decreases in plasma alanine aminotransferase activity (78%) and hepatic malondialdehyde level (70%), when compared with the menadione intoxicated control. In order to define the biochemical mechanism involved in the hepatoprotection afforded by Sch B pretreatment, we examined the activity of DT-diaphorase (DTD) in hepatocytes isolated from Sch B pretreated rats. Hepatocytes isolated from Sch B pretreated (a daily dose of 1 mmol/kg for 3 days) rats showed a significant increase (25%) in DTD activity. The increase in DTD activity was associated with the enhanced rate of menadione elimination in the hepatocyte culture. The ensemble of results suggests that the ability of Sch B pretreatment to enhance hepatocellular DTD activity may at least in part be attributed to the protection against menadione hepatotoxicity.
16278927	In vitro inhibitory effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on 4-methylumbelliferone glucuronidation in recombinant human UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A9--potent inhibition by niflumic acid.	The inhibitory potencies of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A9 activity were investigated in recombinant human UGT1A9 using 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) as a substrate for glucuronidation. 4-MU glucuronidation (4-MUG) showed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a Km value of 6.7 microM. The inhibitory effects of the following seven NSAIDs were investigated: acetaminophen, diclofenac, diflunisal, indomethacin, ketoprofen, naproxen and niflumic acid. Niflumic acid had the most potent inhibitory effect on 4-MUG with an IC50 value of 0.0341 microM. The IC50 values of diflunisal, diclofenac and indomethacin were 1.31, 24.2, and 34.1 microM, respectively, while acetaminophen, ketoprofen and naproxen showed less potent inhibition. Niflumic acid, diflunisal, diclofenac and indomethacin inhibited 4-MUG competitively with Ki values of 0.0275, 0.710, 53.3 and 69.9 microM, respectively, being similar to each IC50 value. In conclusion, of the seven NSAIDs investigated, niflumic acid was the most potent inhibitor of recombinant UGT1A9 via 4-MUG in a competitive manner.
22728231	Transfer of a two-tiered keratinocyte assay: IL-18 production by NCTC2544 to determine the skin sensitizing capacity and epidermal equivalent assay to determine sensitizer potency.	At present, the identification of potentially sensitizing chemicals is carried out using animal models. However, it is very important from ethical, safety and economic point of view to have biological markers to discriminate allergy and irritation events, and to be able to classify sensitizers according to their potency, without the use of animals. Within the Sens-it-iv EU Frame Programme 6 funded Integrated Project (LSHB-CT-2005-018681), a number of in vitro, human cell based assays were developed which, when optimized and used in an integrated testing strategy, may be able to distinguish sensitizers from non-sensitizers. This study describes two of these assays, which when used in a tiered strategy, may be able to identify contact sensitizers and also to quantify sensitizer potency. Tier 1 is the human keratinocyte NCTC2544 IL-18 assay and tier 2 is the Epidermal Equivalent potency assay. The aim of this study is to show the transferability of the two-tiered approach with training chemicals: 3 sensitizers (DNCB, resorcinol, pPD) and 1 non sensitizer (lactic acid) in tier 1 and 2 sensitizers with different potency in tier 2 (DNCB; extreme and resorcinol; moderate). The chemicals were tested in a non-coded fashion. Here we describe the transferability to naïve laboratories, the establishment of the standard operating procedure, critical points, acceptance criteria and project management. Both assays were successfully transferred to laboratories that had not performed the assays previously. The two tiered approach may offer an unique opportunity to provide an alternative method to the Local Lymph Node Assay (LLNA). These assays are both based on the use of human keratinocytes, which have been shown over the last two decades, to play a key role in all phases of skin sensitization.
15478125	Sulfamates and their therapeutic potential.	Starting from the very simple molecule sulfamic acid, O-substituted-, N-substituted-, or di-/tri-substituted sulfamates may be obtained, which show specific biological activities which were or started to be exploited for the design of many types of therapeutic agents. Among them, sulfamate inhibitors of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) were recently reported, constituting completely new classes of antibiotics, useful in the fight of drug-resistant infections. Anti-viral agents incorporating sulfamate moieties have also been obtained, with at least two types of such derivatives investigated: the nucleoside/nucleotide human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and the HIV protease inhibitors (PIs). In the increasing armamentarium of anti-cancer drugs, the sulfamates occupy a special position, with at least two important targets evidenced so far: the steroid sulfatases (STSs) and the carbonic anhydrases (CAs). An impressing number of inhibitors of STSs of the sulfamate type have been reported in the last years, with several compounds, such as 667COUMATE among others, progressing to clinical trials for the treatment of hormone-dependent tumors (breast and prostate cancers). This field is rapidly evolving, with many types of new inhibitors being constantly reported and designed in such a way as to increase their anti-tumor properties, and decrease undesired features (for example, estrogenicity, a problem encountered with the first generation such inhibitors, such as EMATE). Among the many isozymes of CAs, at least two, CA IX and CA XII, are highly overexpressed in tumors, being generally absent in the normal tissues. Inhibition of tumor-associated CAs was hypothesized to lead to novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of cancer. Many sulfamates act as very potent (low nanomolar) CA inhibitors. The X-ray crystal structure of the best-studied isozyme, CA II, with three sulfamates (sulfamic acid, topiramate, and EMATE) has recently been reported, which allowed for a rationale drug design of new inhibitors. Indeed, low nanomolar CA IX inhibitors of the sulfamate type have been reported, although such compounds also act as efficient inhibitors of isozymes CA I and II, which are not associated with tumors. A large number of anti-convulsant sulfamates have been described, with one such compound, topiramate, being widely used clinically as anti-epileptic drug. By taking into consideration a side effect of topiramate, an anti-epileptic drug leading to weight loss in some patients, it has recently been proposed to use this drug and related sulfamates for the treatment of obesity. The rationale of this use is based on the inhibition of the mitochondrial CA isozyme, CA V, involved in lipogenesis. Some sulfamates were also shown to possess potent inhibitory activity against acyl coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase, an enzyme involved in cholesterol metabolism. One such agent, avasimibe, is in advanced clinical trials for the treatment of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. Thus, the sulfamate moiety offers very attractive possibilities for the drug design of various pharmacological agents, which are on one hand due to the relative ease with which such compounds are synthesized, and on the other one, due to the fact that biological activity of most of them is impressive.
23546605	Ovarian Expression of Insulin-Like Peptide 3 (INSL3) and Its Receptor (RXFP2) During Development of Bovine Antral Follicles and Corpora Lutea and Measurement of Circulating INSL3 Levels During Synchronized Estrous Cycles.	Insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL3), a major product of testicular Leydig cells, is also expressed by the ovary, but its functional role remains poorly understood. Here, we quantified expression of INSL3 and its receptor RXFP2 in theca interna cell (TIC) and granulosa cell compartments of developing bovine antral follicles and in corpora lutea (CL). INSL3 and RXFP2 mRNA levels were much higher in TIC than granulosa cell and increased progressively during follicle maturation with INSL3 peaking in large (11-18 mm) estrogen-active follicles and RXFP2 peaking in 9- to 10-mm follicles before declining in larger (11-18 mm) follicles. Expression of both INSL3 and RXFP2 in CL was much lower than in TIC. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry confirmed abundant expression of INSL3 mRNA and protein in TIC. These observations indicate follicular TIC rather than CL as the primary site of both INSL3 production and action, implying a predominantly autocrine/paracrine role in TIC. To corroborate the above findings, we showed that in vitro exposure of TIC to a luteinizing concentration of LH greatly attenuated expression of both INSL3 and its receptor while increasing progesterone secretion and expression of STAR and CYP11A1. Moreover, in vivo, a significant cyclic variation in plasma INSL3 was observed during synchronized estrous cycles. INSL3 and estradiol-17β followed a similar pattern, both increasing after luteolysis, before falling sharply after the LH surge. Thus, theca-derived INSL3, likely from the dominant preovulatory follicle, is detectable in peripheral blood of cattle, and expression is down-regulated during luteinization induced by the preovulatory LH surge. Collectively, these findings underscore the likely role of INSL3 as an important intrafollicular modulator of TIC function/steroidogenesis, while raising doubts about its potential contribution to CL function.
12067524	Enzymatic characterization of a recombinant isoform hybrid of glutamic acid decarboxylase (rGAD67/65) expressed in yeast.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD, EC 4.1.1.15) catalyses the conversion of glutamate to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The 65 kDa isoform, GAD65 is a potent autoantigen in type 1 diabetes, whereas GAD67 is not. A hybrid cDNA was created by fusing a human cDNA for amino acids 1-101 of GAD67 to a human cDNA for amino acids 96-585 of GAD65; the recombinant (r) protein was expressed in yeast and was shown to have equivalent immunoreactivity to mammalian brain GAD with diabetes sera. We here report on enzymatic and molecular properties of rGAD67/65. METHODS: Studies were performed on enzymatic activity of rGAD67/65 by production of 3H-GABA from 3H-glutamate, enzyme kinetics, binding to the enzyme cofactor pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), stability according to differences in pH, temperature and duration of storage, and antigenic reactivity with various GAD-specific antisera. RESULTS: The properties of rGAD67/65 were compared with published data for mammalian brain GAD (brackets). These included a specific enzyme activity of 22.7 (16.7) nKat, optimal pH for enzymatic activity 7.4 (6.8), K(m) of 1.3 (1.3) mM, efficient non-covalent binding to the cofactor PLP, and high autoantigenic potency. The stability of rGAD67/65 was optimal over 3 months at -80 degrees C, or in lyophilized form at -20 degrees C. CONCLUSIONS: Hybrid rGAD67/65 has enzymatic and other properties similar to those of the mixed isoforms of GAD in preparations from mammalian brain as described elsewhere, in addition to its previously described similar immunoreactivity.
19482847	Lowering interleukin-1 activity with anakinra improves myocardial deformation in rheumatoid arthritis.	OBJECTIVE: Inhibition of interleukin-1 activity improves nitro-oxidative stress, endothelial and coronary function. The authors investigated (a) the association of nitro-oxidative stress and endothelial function with myocardial deformation, (b) the effects of anakinra, an interleukin-1a receptor antagonist on myocardial deformation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: The authors compared 46 RA patients to 23 normal controls. 23 patients received anakinra (150 mg subcutaneously once daily) and 23 patients a 5-mg increase of prednisolone dose for 30 days. At baseline and post-treatment this study assessed (a) the left ventricular (LV) longitudinal, circumferential and radial strain and strain rate, using speckle tracking echocardiography, (b) the coronary flow reserve (CFR), (c) the flow-mediated endothelial-dependent dilation of the brachial artery (FMD) and (d) nitrotyrosine (NT) and malondialdehyde blood levels. RESULTS: Patients had impaired baseline myocardial deformation indices compared to controls (p<0.05). CFR and NT levels were related to longitudinal strain, systolic and diastolic strain rate, circumferential strain and systolic strain rate (p<0.05). FMD was related to longitudinal and circumferential diastolic strain rate (p<0.01). Compared to baseline, anakinra-treated patients increased the longitudinal strain (-17.8% (3.7%) vs -22.1% (3.5%)), systolic (-1.02 (0.23) l/s vs -1.25 (0.23) l/s) and diastolic (0.96 (0.37) l/s vs 1.20 (0.39) l/s) longitudinal strain rate, circumferential strain and strain rate (p<0.05 for all comparisons). No significant changes were observed among prednisolone-treated patients CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial deformation is impaired in RA patients and is related to nitro-oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. Chronic inhibition of IL-1 improves LV deformation in parallel with endothelial function and nitro-oxidative stress.
23535349	Risk of ischemic stroke with the use of risperidone, quetiapine and olanzapine in elderly patients: a population-based, case-crossover study.	We conducted a case-crossover study to evaluate the comparative risk of ischemic stroke associated with the use of risperidone, quetiapine and olanzapine in geriatric patients using the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service database. Cases included elderly patients >64 years old who had experienced their first ischemic stroke (International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), I63) hospitalization from July 2005 to June 2006 and who had been without prior cerebrovascular diseases (ICD-10, I60-I69), or transient ischemic attack (ICD-10, G45). Exposures to risperidone, quetiapine and olanzapine were assessed during the 30 days prior to the stroke episode. We set two control periods with lengths which were the same as the hazard periods. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by conditional logistic regression. A total of 1601 cases of ischemic stroke with a mean age of 75.6 (±6.7) years were identified, among which 933 (58.3%) were female. An increased risk of ischemic stroke was associated with the use of risperidone (aOR=3.5, 95% CI 3.3-4.6) and quetiapine (aOR=2.7, 95% CI 2.0-3.6) during the 30 days prior to stroke: however, no significant risk was observed with olanzapine (aOR=1.2, 95% CI 0.7-2.0). The increased stroke risk in demented patients, assessed within 30 days after exposure, was also observed with olanzapine. However, the sample of olanzapine users was small and underpowered.
21413019	Polyamines, androgens, and skeletal muscle hypertrophy.	The naturally occurring polyamines, spermidine, spermine, and their precursor putrescine, play indispensible roles in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, from basic DNA synthesis to regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. The rate-limiting polyamine biosynthetic enzymes, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, are essential for mammalian development, with knockout of the genes encoding these enzymes, Odc1 and Amd1, causing early embryonic lethality in mice. In muscle, the involvement of polyamines in muscle hypertrophy is suggested by the concomitant increase in cardiac and skeletal muscle mass and polyamine levels in response to anabolic agents including beta-agonists. In addition to beta-agonists, androgens, which increase skeletal mass and strength, have also been shown to stimulate polyamine accumulation in a number of tissues. In muscle, androgens act via the androgen receptor to regulate expression of polyamine biosynthetic enzyme genes, including Odc1 and Amd1, which may be one mechanism via which androgens promote muscle growth. This review outlines the role of polyamines in proliferation and hypertrophy, and explores their possible actions in mediating the anabolic actions of androgens in muscle.
15602501	Dopamine transporter gene associated with diminished subjective response to amphetamine.	Individual variability in responses to stimulant drugs may influence risk of stimulant abuse and treatment response. However, the genetic determinants of this variability have yet to be elucidated. The dopamine transporter is an important site of amphetamine action. Therefore, the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1) is a logical candidate gene to study. Using a drug challenge approach, we tested for association between DAT1 genotype and subjective responses to amphetamine in healthy adults. Volunteers participated in a double-blind, crossover design, randomly receiving placebo, 10 mg, and 20 mg oral D-amphetamine, and completed self-report measures on subjective effects including anxiety and euphoria. Subjects were genotyped for the DAT1 3'-untranslated region VNTR polymorphism and divided into groups based on genotype: homozygous for nine repeats (9/9, N=8), heterozygous (9/10, N=36) and homozygous for 10 repeats (10/10, N=52). The effects of amphetamine on ratings of Feel Drug, Anxiety, and Euphoria were examined with ANCOVA. In 9/10 and 10/10 subjects, amphetamine produced its expected effects of increased Euphoria, Anxiety, and Feel Drug (p<0.01). However, in 9/9 subjects, the effects of amphetamine were indistinguishable from placebo, suggesting that the 9/9 genotype has diminished subjective response to acute amphetamine. Interestingly, recent findings also implicate the 9/9 genotype in decreased therapeutic response to the stimulant methylphenidate in ADHD children. The current findings have important implications for understanding the genetic determinants of variability in stimulant response and risk of abuse.
23200732	Lessons from the dissection of the activation functions (AF-1 and AF-2) of the estrogen receptor alpha in vivo.	"Estrogens influence most of the physiological processes in mammals, including but not limited to reproduction, cognition, behavior, vascular system, metabolism and bone integrity. Given this widespread role for estrogen in human physiology, it is not surprising that estrogen influence the pathophysiology of numerous diseases, including cancer (of the reproductive tract as breast, endometrial but also colorectal, prostate,…), as well as neurodegenerative, inflammatory-immune, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, and osteoporosis. These actions are mediated by the activation of estrogen receptors (ER) alpha (ERα) and beta (ERβ), which regulate target gene transcription (genomic action) through two independent activation functions (AF)-1 and AF-2, but can also elicit rapid membrane initiated steroid signals (MISS). Targeted ER gene inactivation has shown that although ERβ plays an important role in the central nervous system and in the heart, ERα appears to play a prominent role in most of the other tissues. Pharmacological activation or inhibition of ERα and/or ERβ provides already the basis for many therapeutic interventions, from hormone replacement at menopause to prevention of the recurrence of breast cancer. However, the use of these estrogens or selective estrogen receptors modulators (SERMs) have also induced undesired effects. Thus, an important challenge consists now to uncouple the beneficial actions from other deleterious ones. The in vivo molecular ""dissection"" of ERα represents both a molecular and integrated approach that already allowed to delineate in mouse the role of the main ""subfunctions"" of the receptor and that could pave the way to an optimization of the ER modulation."
23303191	Hyaluronan synthase 1 (HAS1) requires higher cellular UDP-GlcNAc concentration than HAS2 and HAS3.	Mammals have three homologous genes encoding proteins with hyaluronan synthase activity (Has1-3), all producing an identical polymer from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and UDP-glucuronic acid. To compare the properties of these isoenzymes, COS-1 cells, with minor endogenous hyaluronan synthesis, were transfected with human Has1-3 isoenzymes. HAS1 was almost unable to secrete hyaluronan or form a hyaluronan coat, in contrast to HAS2 and HAS3. This failure of HAS1 to synthesize hyaluronan was compensated by increasing the cellular content of UDP-N-acetyl glucosamine by ∼10-fold with 1 mm glucosamine in the growth medium. Hyaluronan synthesis driven by HAS2 was less affected by glucosamine addition, and HAS3 was not affected at all. Glucose-free medium, leading to depletion of the UDP-sugars, markedly reduced hyaluronan synthesis by all HAS isoenzymes while raising its concentration from 5 to 25 mm had a moderate stimulatory effect. The results indicate that HAS1 is almost inactive in cells with low UDP-sugar supply, HAS2 activity increases with UDP-sugars, and HAS3 produces hyaluronan at high speed even with minimum substrate content. Transfected Has2 and particularly Has3 consumed enough UDP-sugars to reduce their content in COS-1 cells. Comparison of different human cell types revealed ∼50-fold differences in the content of UDP-N-acetylhexosamines and UDP-glucuronic acid, correlating with the expression level of Has1, suggesting cellular coordination between Has1 expression and the content of UDP-sugars.
10460642	Marimastat inhibits elastin degradation and matrix metalloproteinase 2 activity in a model of aneurysm disease.	BACKGROUND: Abdominal aortic aneurysms are characterized by degradation of the extracellular matrix, with a reduction in the elastin concentration of the arterial media. These changes have been linked to increased levels of endogenous metalloproteinases (MMPs) within the aorta, particularly MMP-2 and MMP-9. This provides a potential therapeutic target for pharmacological agents aimed at reducing the growth rate of small aneurysms. In this study, the ability of marimastat (an MMP inhibitor) to reduce matrix degradation was assessed in a previously described model of aneurysm disease. METHODS: Porcine aortic segments (n = 12) were preincubated in exogenous pancreatic elastase for 24 h before culture in standard conditions for 13 days with marimastat 10(-5), 10(-6) and 10(-7) mol/l. Control segments were cultured both without marimastat and without elastase. At the termination of culture, MMPs were extracted from the tissue and quantified by substrate gel enzymography. The volume fractions of elastin and collagen were determined by stereological analysis of sections stained with Miller's elastin and van Gieson's stain. RESULTS: Stereological analysis demonstrated preservation of elastin in aorta treated with marimastat at 10(-6) and 10(-5) mol/l; this was significant at the latter concentration (P = 0.007). This was accompanied by a significant reduction in active MMP-2 activity in the samples treated with marimastat 10(-5) mol/l (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Marimastat significantly inhibited elastin degradation and active MMP-2 production within aortic organ cultures.
17468175	Dopamine D1 receptor agonist and D2 receptor antagonist effects of the natural product (-)-stepholidine: molecular modeling and dynamics simulations.	"(-)-Stepholidine (SPD), an active ingredient of the Chinese herb Stephania, is the first compound found to have dual function as a dopamine receptor D1 agonist and D2 antagonist. Insights into dynamical behaviors of D1 and D2 receptors and their interaction modes with SPD are crucial in understanding the structural and functional characteristics of dopamine receptors. In this study a computational approach, integrating protein structure prediction, automated molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations were employed to investigate the dual action mechanism of SPD on the D1 and D2 receptors, with the eventual aim to develop new drugs for treating diseases affecting the central nervous system such as schizophrenia. The dynamics simulations revealed the surface features of the electrostatic potentials and the conformational ""open-closed"" process of the binding entrances of two dopamine receptors. Potential binding conformations of D1 and D2 receptors were obtained, and the D1-SPD and D2-SPD complexes were generated, which are in good agreement with most of experimental data. The D1-SPD structure shows that the K-167_EL-2-E-302_EL-3 (EL-2: extracellular loop 2; EL-3: extracellular loop 3) salt bridge plays an important role for both the conformational change of the extracellular domain and the binding of SPD. Based on our modeling and simulations, we proposed a mechanism of the dual action of SPD and a subsequent signal transduction model. Further mutagenesis and biophysical experiments are needed to test and improve our proposed dual action mechanism of SPD and signal transduction model."
23482500	Sorafenib Hepatobiliary Disposition: Mechanisms of Hepatic Uptake and Disposition of Generated Metabolites.	Sorafenib is an orally active tyrosine kinase inhibitor used in the treatment of renal and hepatocellular carcinoma. This study was designed to establish whether transport proteins are involved in the hepatic uptake of sorafenib, and to determine the extent of biliary excretion of sorafenib/metabolites in human hepatocytes. Initial uptake was assessed in freshly isolated, suspended human hepatocytes in the presence of inhibitors and modulators. [(14)C]Sorafenib (1 μM) uptake at 4°C was ~61-63% of the uptake at 37°C, suggesting a high degree of passive diffusion. Hepatocyte uptake of [(14)C]sorafenib was not Na(+)-dependent or influenced by the organic anion transporter 2 (OAT2) inhibitor ketoprofen. However, initial [(14)C]sorafenib hepatocyte uptake was reduced by 46 and 30% compared to control values in the presence of the organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibitor rifamycin SV, and the organic cation transporter (OCT) inhibitor decynium 22, respectively. [(14)C]Sorafenib (0.5 to 5 μM) uptake was significantly higher in hOCT1-transfected CHO cells compared to mock cells, and inhibited by the general OCT inhibitor, MPP(+). OCT1-mediated uptake was saturable with a Km of 3.80 ± 2.53 μM and Vmax of 116 ± 42 pmol/mg/min. The biliary excretion index (BEI) and in vitro biliary clearance (Clbiliary) of sorafenib (1 μM) in sandwich-cultured human hepatocytes were low (~11% and 11 ml/min/kg, respectively). Results suggest that sorafenib uptake in human hepatocytes occurs via passive diffusion, and by OCT1 and a rifamycin-sensitive transporter. Sorafenib undergoes modest biliary excretion, predominantly as glucuronide conjugate(s).
23202585	The ATPase domain of ISWI is an autonomous nucleosome remodeling machine.	ISWI slides nucleosomes along DNA, enabling the structural changes of chromatin required for the regulated use of eukaryotic genomes. Prominent mechanistic models imply cooperation of the ISWI ATPase domain with a C-terminal DNA-binding function residing in the HAND-SANT-SLIDE (HSS) domain. Contrary to these models, we show by quantitative biochemical means that all fundamental aspects of nucleosome remodeling are contained within the compact ATPase module of Drosophila ISWI. This domain can independently associate with DNA and nucleosomes, which in turn activate ATP turnover by inducing a conformational change in the enzyme, and it can autonomously reposition nucleosomes. The role of the HSS domain is to increase the affinity and specificity for nucleosomes. Nucleosome-remodeling enzymes may thus have evolved directly from ancestral helicase-type motors, and peripheral domains have furnished regulatory capabilities that bias the remodeling reaction toward different structural outcomes.
23349208	Evaluation of suppressive and pro-resolving effects of EPA and DHA in human primary monocytes and T-helper cells.	Despite their beneficial anti-inflammatory properties, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) may increase the infection risk at high doses, likely by generating an immune-depressed state. To assess the contribution of different immune cell populations to the immunomodulatory fatty acid effect, we comparatively investigated several aspects of inflammation in human T-helper (Th) cells and monocytes. Both fatty acids, but DHA to a lesser extent compared with EPA, selectively and dose-dependently reduced the percentage of cytokine-expressing Th cells in a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ-dependent fashion, whereas the expression of the cell surface marker CD69 was unaltered on activated T cells. In monocytes, both EPA and DHA increased interleukin (IL)-10 without affecting tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-6. Cellular incorporation of EPA and DHA occurred mainly at the expense of arachidonic acid. Concomitantly, thromboxane B (TXB)2 and leukotriene B (LTB)4 in supernatants decreased, while levels of TXB3 and LTB5 increased. This increase was independent of activation and in accordance with cyclooxygenase expression patterns in monocytes. Moreover, EPA and DHA gave rise to a variety of mono- and trihydroxy derivatives of highly anti-inflammatory potential, such as resolvins and their precursors. Our results suggest that EPA and DHA do not generally affect immune cell functions in an inhibitory manner but rather promote pro-resolving responses.
23401474	Drug cocktail interaction study on the effect of the orally administered lavender oil preparation silexan on cytochrome p450 enzymes in healthy volunteers.	This cocktail study evaluated the interaction potential of the oral lavender oil preparation silexan with major P450 (cytochrome P450) enzymes. Subjects and Methods: Sixteen healthy male or female Caucasians completed this double-blind, randomized, 2-fold crossover study. Silexan (160 mg) or placebo were administered once daily for 11 days. Additionally, on day 11 of both study periods, 150 mg caffeine (CYP1A2), 125 mg tolbutamide (CYP2C9), 20 mg omeprazole (CYP2C19), 30 mg dextromethorphan-HBr (CYP2D6), and 2 mg midazolam (CYP3A4) were administered orally. Formal interaction was excluded if the 90% confidence interval (CI) for the silexan over placebo ratios for phenotyping metrics (primary: AUC0-t) was within a 0.70-1.43 range. Results: According to the AUC0-t comparisons, silexan had no relevant effect on CYP1A2, 2C9, 2D6, and 3A4 activity. Secondary phenotyping metrics confirmed this result. Mean ratios for all omeprazole-derived metrics were close to unity. The 90% CI for the AUC0-t ratio of omeprazole but not for omeprazole/5-OH-omeprazole plasma ratio 3 hours post-dose or omeprazole/5-OH-omeprazole AUC0-t ratio (secondary CYP2C19 metrics) was above the predefined threshold of 1.43, probably caused by the inherent high variability of omeprazole pharmacokinetics. Silexan and the phenotyping drugs were well tolerated. Repeated silexan (160 mg/day) administration has no clinically relevant inhibitory or inducing effects on the CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4 enzymes in vivo.
23643094	Nordihydroguaiaretic acid induces Nrf2 nuclear translocation in vivo and attenuates renal damage and apoptosis in the ischemia and reperfusion model.	It has been shown that the pretreatment with nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), a lignan with direct and indirect antioxidant properties, protects against the ischemia-reperfusion (I/R)-induced renal oxidant damage. Although it has been shown that NDGA induces Nrf2 nuclear translocation in renal epithelial LLC-PK1 cells in culture, it is unknown if NDGA may induce Nrf2 translocation in vivo. In this work was explored if NDGA is able to induce in vivo Nrf2 nuclear translocation in kidneys of rats submitted to uni-nephrectomy (U-NX) or I/R injury. Four groups of male Wistar rats were used: U-NX, NDGA, I/R, and I/R+NDGA. NDGA was injected i.p. (10mg/kg/day) starting 48h before I/R. Kidney samples were obtained at 3h of reperfusion after to measure Nrf2 translocation. Additional groups of rats were studied at 24h of reperfusion to measure histological damage and apoptosis. NDGA was able to induce Nrf2 translocation in vivo in kidneys of rats submitted to both U-NX and I/R injury and to protect against renal histological damage and apoptosis. It is concluded that the pretreatment of NDGA is able to induce in vivo nuclear Nrf2 translocation in kidney of rats suggesting that this may be involved in the renoprotection against I/R.
23183186	P21-activated protein kinase 1 (Pak1) mediates the cross talk between insulin and β-catenin on proglucagon gene expression and its ablation affects glucose homeostasis in male C57BL/6 mice.	In gut endocrine L cells, the Wnt signaling pathway effector β-catenin (β-cat)/transcription factor 7-like 2 mediates the stimulatory effect of insulin on proglucagon (gcg) expression and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) production. In several other cell lineages, insulin is able to stimulate p21-activated protein kinase 1 (Pak1). Here we determined the role of Pak1 in gcg expression and the effect of Pak1 deletion on glucose homeostasis. Insulin stimulated Pak1 activation through increasing its Thr423 phosphorylation in gut gcg-expressing cell lines, associated with increased gcg mRNA levels. This stimulation was attenuated by the Pak inhibitor 2,2'-dihydroxy-1,1'-dinaphthyldisulfide (IPA3) or dominant-negative Pak1. Both insulin and cAMP-promoting agents activated β-cat Ser675 phosphorylation, which was attenuated by IPA3 or protein kinase A inhibition, respectively. Gut gcg levels were reduced in male Pak1(-/-) mice, associated with impaired glucose tolerance after an ip or oral glucose challenge. These mice had lower circulating active GLP-1 levels after a glucose challenge as well as reduced distal ileum GLP-1 content after insulin treatment. Finally, the Pak1(-/-) mice exhibited reduced brainstem gcg level and abolished β-cat Ser675 phosphorylation in brain neurons after insulin treatment. We suggest that Pak1 mediates the cross talk between insulin and Wnt signaling pathways on gut and brain gcg expression, and its ablation impairs glucose homeostasis.
1284246	The primary structure of porcine aminoacylase 1 deduced from cDNA sequence.	A cDNA encoding the complete amino acid sequence of aminoacylase 1 (N-acylamino acid aminohydrolase, ACY-1) [EC 3.5.1.14], a dimeric metalloprotein having two Zn2+ in the molecule, which catalyzes the deacylation of N-acylated L-amino acids except L-aspartic acid, has been isolated from porcine kidney lambda gt10 cDNA library and sequenced. From sequence analysis of the cDNA and the N- and C-terminal amino acid analyses of the purified protein, it is deduced that porcine kidney ACY-1 consists of two identical subunits (M(r) 45,260), each of which consists of a single chain of 406 amino acids with acetylalanine at the N-terminus. A cDNA encoding porcine liver ACY-1 was also cloned. The amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA from porcine liver was identical to that deduced for porcine kidney ACY-1. Northern blot analysis suggested that ACY-1 is more highly expressed in kidney than in liver. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of porcine ACY-1 with those of other Zn2+-binding metalloenzymes showed no significant homologies in either the overall sequence or the consensus sequences for the metal binding sites. This indicates that ACY-1 is a new type of metalloprotein.
12388748	Formation of Mallory body-like inclusions and cell death induced by deregulated expression of keratin 18.	Mallory bodies (MBs) are cytoplasmic inclusions that contain keratin 8 (K8) and K18 and are present in hepatocytes of individuals with alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or benign or malignant hepatocellular neoplasia. Mice fed long term with griseofulvin are an animal model of MB formation. However, the lack of a cellular model has impeded understanding of the molecular mechanism of this process. Culture of HepG2 cells with griseofulvin has now been shown to induce both the formation of intracellular aggregates containing K18 as well as an increase in the abundance of K18 mRNA. Overexpression of K18 in HepG2, HeLa, or COS-7 cells also induced the formation of intracellular aggregates that stained with antibodies to ubiquitin and with rhodamine B (characteristics of MBs formed in vivo), eventually leading to cell death. The MB-like aggregates were deposited around centrosomes and disrupted the microtubular array. Coexpression of K8 with K18 restored the normal fibrous pattern of keratin distribution and reduced the toxicity of K18. In contrast, an NH(2)-terminal deletion mutant of K8 promoted the formation of intracellular aggregates even in the absence of K18 overexpression. Deregulated expression of K18, or an imbalance between K8 and K18, may thus be an important determinant of MB formation, which compromises the function of centrosomes and the microtubule network and leads to cell death.
10882160	Clinical pharmacology, therapeutic use and potential of COMT inhibitors in Parkinson's disease.	When peripheral decarboxylation is blocked by carbidopa or benserazide, the main metabolic pathway of levodopa is O-methylation by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). Entacapone and tolcapone are new potent, selective and reversible nitrocatechol-type COMT inhibitors. Animal studies have demonstrated that entacapone mainly has a peripheral effect whereas tolcapone also inhibits O-methylation in the brain. In human volunteers, both entacapone and tolcapone dose-dependently inhibit the COMT activity in erythrocytes, improve the bioavailability and decrease the elimination of levodopa, and inhibit the formation of 3-O-methyldopa (3-OMD). Entacapone is administered with every scheduled dose of levodopa whereas tolcapone is administered 3 times daily. The different administration regimens for these agents are based on their different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles. Both entacapone and tolcapone enhance and extend the therapeutic effect of levodopa in patients with advanced and fluctuating Parkinson's disease. They prolong the duration of levodopa effect. Clinical studies show that they increase the daily ON time by an average 1 to 3 hours, improve the activities of daily living and allow daily levodopa dosage to be decreased. Correspondingly, they significantly reduce the daily OFF time. No comparative studies between entacapone and tolcapone have been performed. Tolcapone also appears to have a beneficial effect in patients with nonfluctuating Parkinson's disease. The main adverse effects of the COMT inhibitors are related to their dopaminergic and gastrointestinal effects. Enhancement of dopaminergic activity may cause an initial worsening of levodopa-induced adverse effects, such as dyskinesia, nausea, vomiting, orthostatic hypotension, sleep disorders and hallucinations. Levodopa dose adjustment is recommended to avoid these events. Tolcapone is associated with diarrhoea in about 16 to 18% of patients and entacapone in less than 10% of patients. Diarrhoea has led to discontinuation in 5 to 6% of patients treated with tolcapone and in 2.5% of those treated with entacapone. Urine discoloration to dark yellow or orange is related to the colour of COMT inhibitors and their metabolites. Elevated liver transaminase levels are reported in 1 to 3% of patients treated with tolcapone but very rarely, if at all, in patients treated with entacapone. The descriptions of acute, fatal fulminant hepatitis and potentially fatal neurological reactions, such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome and rhabdomyolysis, in association with tolcapone led to the suspension of its marketing authorisation in the European Community and Canada. In many other countries, the use of tolcapone is restricted to patients who are not responding satisfactorily to other therapies. Regular monitoring of liver enzymes is required if tolcapone is used. No such adverse reactions have so far been described for entacapone and no laboratory monitoring has been proposed. COMT inhibitors added to levodopa therapy are beneficial, particularly in patients with fluctuating disease. They may be combined with other antiparkinsonian drugs, such as dopamine agonists, selegiline and anticholinergics without adverse interactions. They provide a new treatment possibility in patients with Parkinson's disease who have problems with their present levodopa therapy.
14662656	Mitochondrial complex I mutations in Caenorhabditis elegans produce cytochrome c oxidase deficiency, oxidative stress and vitamin-responsive lactic acidosis.	Mitochondrial dysfunction, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 10 000 live births, is among the most common genetically determined conditions. Missense mutations in the human NDUFV1 gene, which encodes the 51 kDa active site subunit of the NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase or complex I, can lead to severe neurological disorders. Owing to the rare and often sporadic nature of mitochondrial disorders, the mechanisms of pathogenesis of most mutations remain poorly understood. We have generated transgenic strains of Caenorhabditis elegans that express disease-causing mutations in the nuo-1 gene, the C. elegans homolog of the NDUFV1 gene. The transgenic strains demonstrate hallmark features of complex I dysfunction such as lactic acidosis and decreased NADH-dependent mitochondrial respiration. They are also hypersensitive to exogenous oxidative stress, suggesting that cellular defense mechanisms against reactive oxygen species are already taxed by an endogenous stress. The lactic acidosis induced by the NDUFV1 mutations could be partially corrected with the vitamins riboflavin and thiamine or with sodium dichloroacetate, an activator of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, resulting in significant increases in animal fitness. Surprisingly, cytochrome c oxidase activity and protein levels were reduced, establishing a connection between complexes I and IV. Our results indicate that complex I mutations exert their pathogenic effects in multiple ways: by impeding the metabolism of NADH, by increasing the production of reactive oxygen species, and by interfering with the function or assembly of other mitochondrial respiratory chain components.
23188828	Phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S3 and antiapoptotic TRAF2 protein mediates radioresistance in non-small cell lung cancer cells.	Radioresistance is considered as a main factor restricting efficacy of radiotherapy. However, the exact molecular mechanism of radioresistance has not been explained yet. In this study, to elucidate radioresistance mechanism in lung cancer, we compared radiation responses in two types of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells with different radiosensitivity and identified key molecules conferring radioresistance. In radioresistant NSCLC cells, ionizing radiation (IR) led to casein kinase 2α (CK2α)- and PKC-mediated phosphorylation of rpS3 and TRAF2, respectively, which induced dissociation of rpS3-TRAF2 complex and NF-κB activation, resulting in significant up-regulation of prosurvival genes (cIAP1, cIAP2, and survivin). Also, dissociated phospho-rpS3 translocated into nucleus and bound with NF-κB complex (p65 and p50), contributing to p65 DNA binding property and specificity. However, in radiosensitive NSCLC cells, IR-mediated rpS3 phosphorylation was not detected due to the absence of CK2α overexpression. Consequently, IR-induced rpS3-TRAF2 complex dissociation, NF-κB activation, and prosurvival gene expression were not presented. Taken together, our findings revealed a novel radioresistance mechanism through functional orchestration of rpS3, TRAF2, and NF-κB in NSCLC cells. Moreover, we provided the first evidence for the function of rpS3 as a new TRAF2-binding protein and demonstrated that phosphorylation of both rpS3 and TRAF2 is a key control point of radioresistance in NSCLC cells. These results suggest that regulation of rpS3 and TRAF2 in combination with radiotherapy could have high pharmacological therapeutic potency for radioresistance of NSCLC.
16540317	Human methionine aminopeptidase type 2 in complex with L- and D-methionine.	Human methionine aminopeptidase type 2 (hMetAP-2) was identified as the molecular target of anti-angiogenic agents such as fumagillin and its analogues. We describe here the crystal structure of hMetAP-2 in complex with l-methionine and d-methionine at 1.9 and 2.0A resolution, respectively. The comparison of the structure of the two complexes establishes the basis of enantiomer discrimination and provides some considerations for the design of selective MetAP-2 inhibitors.
23454208	Induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis and non-canonical autophagy by luteolin in NCI-H460 lung carcinoma cells.	In this study, we investigated the anti-cancer effects of luteolin, a member of the flavonoid family, in NCI-H460 human lung carcinoma cells. It was shown that luteolin induces apoptotic cell death through modulating both the extrinsic pathway and intrinsic pathways, which are suppressed by z-VAD-fmk, indicating that luteolin triggers caspase-dependant apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that the α subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α/C/EBP homologous protein pathway, but not the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway, played a critical role in induction of apoptosis by luteolin. The data indicated that luteolin also induces autophagy; evidence for this is the accumulation of microtubule-associated protein light chain-3 (LC3) II protein, the increase of LC3 puncta as well as an enhanced autophagy flux. In addition, inhibiting autophagy by bafilomycin A1 reduced apoptotic cell death, suggesting that luteolin-induced autophagy functions as a cell death mechanism. Notably, the activated caspases that appeared with luteolin treatment cleaved Beclin-1, and the expression of LC3II remained the same even after cells were challenged with Beclin-1 siRNA, demonstrating that luteolin induces Beclin-1-independent autophagy. Taken together, our findings showed that luteolin triggers both endoplasmic reticulum stress-related apoptosis and non-canonical autophagy, which function as a cell death mechanism in NCI-H460 human lung cancer cells.
17349707	Production of N-acetyl-D-neuraminic acid by recombinant whole cells expressing Anabaena sp. CH1 N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 2-epimerase and Escherichia coli N-acetyl-D-neuraminic acid lyase.	N-acetyl-d-neuraminic acid (NeuAc; sialic acid) is a precursor for the manufacture of many pharmaceutical drugs, such as anti-influenza virus agents. To develop a whole cell process for NeuAc production, genes of Anabaena sp. CH1 N-acetyl-d-glucosamine 2-epimerase (bage) and Escherichia coli N-acetyl-d-neuraminic acid lyase (nanA) were cloned and expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). The expressed bGlcNAc 2-epimerase was purified from the crude cell extract of IPTG-induced E. coli BL21 (DE3) (pET-bage) to homogeneity by nickel-chelate chromatography. The molecular mass of the purified bGlcNAc 2-epimerase was determined to be 42kDa by SDS-PAGE. The pH and temperature optima of the recombinant bGlcNAc 2-epimerase were pH 7.0 and 50 degrees C, respectively, and only needs 20mum ATP for maximal activity. The specific activity of bGlcNAc 2-epimerase (124Umg(-1) protein) for the conversion of N-acetyl-d-glucosamine to N-acetyl-d-manosamine was about four-fold higher than that of porcine N-acetyl-d-glucosamine 2-epimerase. A stirred glass vessel containing transformed E. coli cells expressing age gene from Anabaena sp. CH1 and NeuAc lyase gene from E. coli NovaBlue separately was used for the conversion of GlcNAc and pyruvate to NeuAc. A maximal productivity of 10.2gNeuAcl(-1)h(-1) with 33.3% conversion yield from GlcNAc could be obtained in a 12-h reaction. The recombinant E. coli cells can be reused for more than eight cycles with a productivity of >8.0gNeuAcL(-1)h(-1). In this process, the expensive activator, ATP, necessary for maximal activity of GlcNAc 2-epimerase in free enzyme system can be omitted.
10831596	Severe impairment of salivation in Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransporter (NKCC1)-deficient mice.	The salivary fluid secretory mechanism is thought to require Na(+)/K(+)/2Cl(-) cotransporter-mediated Cl(-) uptake. To directly test this possibility we studied the in vivo and in vitro functioning of acinar cells from the parotid glands of mice with targeted disruption of Na(+)/K(+)/2Cl(-) cotransporter isoform 1 (Nkcc1), the gene encoding the salivary Na(+)/K(+)/2Cl(-) cotransporter. In wild-type mice NKCC1 was localized to the basolateral membranes of parotid acinar cells, whereas expression was not detected in duct cells. The lack of functional NKCC1 resulted in a dramatic reduction (>60%) in the volume of saliva secreted in response to a muscarinic agonist, the primary in situ salivation signal. Consistent with defective Cl(-) uptake, a loss of bumetanide-sensitive Cl(-) influx was observed in parotid acinar cells from mice lacking NKCC1. Cl(-)/ HCO(3)(-) exchanger activity was increased in parotid acinar cells isolated from knockout mice suggesting that the residual saliva secreted by mice lacking NKCC1 is associated with anion exchanger-dependent Cl(-) uptake. Indeed, expression of the Cl(-)/ HCO(3)(-) exchanger AE2 was enhanced suggesting that this transporter compensates for the loss of functional Na(+)/K(+)/2Cl(-) cotransporter. Furthermore, the ability of the parotid gland to conserve NaCl was abolished in NKCC1-deficient mice. This deficit was not associated with changes in the morphology of the ducts, but transcript levels for the alpha-, beta-, and gamma-subunits of the epithelial Na(+) channel were reduced. These data directly demonstrate that NKCC1 is the major Cl(-) uptake mechanism across the basolateral membrane of acinar cells and is critical for driving saliva secretion in vivo.
18046910	Utility of tolcapone in fluctuating Parkinson's disease.	"Fluctuating Parkinson's disease (PD) represents a clinical management challenge. The primary utility of levodopa in patients with PD is moderated by the ""wearing off"" phenomena seen with long-term use. COMT inhibitors slow down the rapid metabolism of levodopa, resulting in a more-sustained response to dopaminergic therapy. Tolcapone is a selective, reversible catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor, shown to have both peripheral and central effects. In clinical trials, tolcapone has been shown to reduce ""off"" time, increase ""on"" time, improve patient and clinician assessments of disease severity, and improve patient quality of life. In a SWITCH study, tolcapone was associated with greater duration of ""on"" time than remaining on entacapone. Adverse effects of tolcapone are related to the class, with the exception of rare cases of hepatotoxicity. Tolcapone has been recently reintroduced on the European market and recent guidance from the US Food and Drug Administration has reduced the hepatic monitoring requirements for patients initiating tolcapone therapy. With proper monitoring, tolcapone is an effective, well-tolerated drug useful in the management of patients with fluctuating PD."
23606523	A Model-Based Approach to Predict Longitudinal HbA1c, Using Early Phase Glucose Data From Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients After Anti-Diabetic Treatment.	Predicting late phase outcomes from early-phase findings can help inform decisions in drug development. If the measurements in early-phase differ from those in late phase, forecasting is more challenging. In this paper, we present a model-based approach for predicting glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in late phase using glucose and insulin concentrations from an early-phase study, investigating an anti-diabetic treatment. Two previously published models were used; an integrated glucose and insulin (IGI) model for meal tolerance tests and an integrated glucose-red blood cell-HbA1c (IGRH) model predicting the formation of HbA1c from the average glucose concentration (Cg,av ). Output from the IGI model was used as input to the IGRH model. Parameters of the IGI model and drug effects were estimated using data from a phase1 study in 59 diabetic patients receiving various doses of a glucokinase activator. Cg,av values were simulated according to a Phase 2 study design and used in the IGRH model for predictions of HbA1c. The performance of the model-based approach was assessed by comparing the predicted to the actual outcome of the Phase 2 study. We have shown that this approach well predicts the longitudinal HbA1c response in a 12-week study using only information from a 1-week study where glucose and insulin concentrations were measured.
23157627	Facilitative effect of serotonin(1A) receptor agonists on cognition in patients with schizophrenia.	Disturbances of cognitive function are considered to largely affect the outcome in patients with schizophrenia. There is much attention to the role of psychotropic compounds acting on serotonin (5-HT) receptors in ameliorating cognitive deficits of the disease. Among the 5-HT receptor subtypes, the 5-HT(1A) receptor is attracting particular interests as a potential target for enhancing cognition, based on preclinical and clinical evidence. The neural network underlying the ability of 5-HT(1A) agonists to treat cognitive impairments of schizophrenia likely includes dopamine, glutamate, and gamma-aminobutyric acid neurons. Recent advances of electrophysiological measures, such as event-related potentials, have provided insights into facilitative effects on cognition of some atypical antipsychotic drugs or related compounds acting directly or indirectly on 5-HT(1A) receptors. These considerations are expected to promote the development of novel therapeutics for the betterment of functional outcome in people suffering from schizophrenia.
8799556	Evaluation of the pharmacological selectivity profile of alpha 1 adrenoceptor antagonists at prostatic alpha 1 adrenoceptors: binding, functional and in vivo studies.	"1. The profile of a range of alpha 1 adrenoceptor antagonists was determined in vitro against cloned human alpha 1A, alpha 1B and alpha 1D adrenoceptors and against noradrenaline-mediated contractions of rat aorta and human prostate. The in vivo profile of compounds was determined in an anaesthetized dog model which allowed the simultaneous assessment of antagonist potency against phenylephrine-mediated increases in blood pressure and prostatic pressure. 2. The quinazoline antagonists, prazosin, doxazosin and alfuzosin displayed high affinity but were non selective for the three cloned human alpha 1 adrenoceptors. Indoramin and SNAP 1069 showed selectivity for alpha 1A and alpha 1B adrenoceptors relative to the alpha 1D subtype. Rec 15/2739, WB 4101, SL 89,0591, (+)- and (-)- tamsulosin showed selectivity for alpha 1A and alpha 1D adrenoceptors relative to the alpha 1B subtype. RS 17053 showed high affinity and selectivity for alpha 1A adrenoceptors (pKi 8.6) relative to alpha 1B (pKi = 7.3) and alpha 1D (pKi = 7.1) subtypes. 3. (+)-Tamsulosin, (-)-tamsulosin, SL 89,0591, Rec 15/2739, SNAP 1069 and RS 17053 appeared to act as competitive antagonists of noradrenaline-mediated contractions of rat aorta yielding pA2 affinity estimates which were similar to binding affinities at cloned human alpha 1D adrenoceptors. The following rank order was obtained: prazosin = (-)-tamsulosin > doxazosin > SL 89,0591 = (+)-tamsulosin > Rec 15/2739 > RS 17053 = SNAP 1069. 4. (-)-Tamsulosin was a very potent, insurmountable antagonist of noradrenaline-mediated contractions of human prostate, yielding an approximate pA2 estimate of 9.8 at 1 nM. The corresponding (+)-enantiomer was 30 fold weaker. SL 89,0591, SNAP 1069 and Rec 15/2739 yielded pA2 estimates which compared well with their alpha 1A binding affinities. The affinity estimate for prazosin on human prostate was lower than the corresponding binding affinity determined at alpha 1A adrenoceptors and RS 17053 was a very weak antagonist on human prostate (pA2 = 6.0) relative to the high affinity (pKi = 8.6) determined at cloned human alpha 1A adrenoceptors. 5. In the anaesthetized dog, in vivo pseudo ""pA2' values showed that doxazosin, (+)- and (-)-tamsulosin inhibited phenylephrine-induced increases in prostatic and blood pressure with similar affinity, implying that these agents show little or no selectivity for prostatic responses in this model. SL 89,0591 and SNAP 1069 were moderately selective (3 and 6 fold respectively) for prostatic pressure relative to blood pressure. Rec 15/2739 was a more potent antagonist of phenylephrine-mediated increases in prostatic pressure (""pA2' = 8.74) compared to blood pressure (""pA2' = 7.51). 6. Data in this study suggest that the alpha 1 adrenoceptor mediating noradrenaline-induced contractions of human prostate, whilst having some of the characteristics of an alpha 1A adrenoceptor, cannot be satisfactorily aligned with cloned alpha 1A, alpha 1B or alpha 1D adrenoceptors. In addition, studies in the anaesthetized dog have shown that agents having high affinity and selectivity for prostatic alpha 1 adrenoceptors, particularly over the alpha 1D subtype, appear to inhibit phenylephrine-induced increases in prostatic pressure selectively compared to blood pressure."
23401228	[6]-Shogaol Attenuates Neuronal Apoptosis in Hydrogen Peroxide-Treated Astrocytes Through the Up-Regulation of Neurotrophic Factors.	Neuronal apoptosis induced by oxidative stress is a prominent feature of neurodegenerative disorders. [6]-shogaol, a bio-active compound in ginger, possesses potent anti-inflammatory actions and has recently emerged as a potential therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative disorders. However, the effects of [6]-shogaol on astroglial apoptosis following exogenously induced oxidative stress has not yet been investigated. Here, we show that the anti-apoptotic activity of [6]-shogaol in astrocytes following exposure to hydrogen peroxide (H(2) O(2) ) involves a marked up-regulation of neurotrophic factors such as nerve growth factor, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Astrocytes co-treated with [6]-shogaol and H(2) O(2) for 1 h showed decrease in reactive oxygen species production compared with those only treated with H(2) O(2) . Moreover, [6]-shogaol counteracted the reduced expression of ERK1/2 in H(2) O(2) -treated astrocytes and protected these cells from oxidative stress and apoptosis by attenuating the impairment of mitochondrial function proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Additionally, [6]-shogaol inhibits the expression of the apoptotic proteins Bax and caspase-3 in H(2) O(2) -treated astrocytes. This data suggest that following oxidative stress, [6]-shogaol protects astrocytes from oxidative damage through the up-regulating levels of neurotrophic factors. These findings provide further support for the use of [6]-shogaol as a therapeutic agent in neurodegenerative disorders. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
23313270	Tricycloalternarenes F-H: three new mixed terpenoids produced by an endolichenic fungus Ulocladium sp. using OSMAC method.	Three new mixed terpenoids, tricycloalternarenes (TCAs) F-H (1-3), together with ten known tricycloalternarenes (4-13), were isolated from the Czapek's culture of an endophytic fungus Ulocladium sp. Their structures were identified by extensive spectroscopic experiments (NMR and MS) and comparison with literature data. TCA 1b (5) showed weak activity against the Bacille Calmette-Guerin strain with the MIC of 125μg/mL. TCA 9b (10) exhibited strong cytotoxic activity against Hela cell line with IC50 of 8.58μM.
15577244	Tyrosinase inhibitors from Rhododendron collettianum and their structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies.	A new coumarinolignoid 8'-epi-cleomiscosin A (1) together with the new glycoside 8-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-6-hydroxy-2-methyl-4H-1-benzopyrane-4-one (2) have been isolated from the aerial parts of Rhododendron collettianum and their structures determined on the basis of spectroscopic evidences. Tyrosinase inhibition study of these compounds and their structure-activity relationship (SAR) were also investigated. The compounds exhibited potent to mild inhibition activity against the enzyme. Especially, the compound 1 showed strong inhibition (IC50=1.33 microM) against the enzyme tyrosinase, as compared to the standard tyrosinase inhibitors kojic acid (IC50=16.67 microM) and L-mimosine (IC50=3.68 microM), indicating its potential used for the treatment of hyperpigmentation associated with the high production of melanocytes.
23598400	P300 during response inhibition is associated with ad-lib alcohol consumption in social drinkers.	Reduced amplitude of the cortical P300 event-related potential (ERP) component during response inhibition is associated with vulnerability to alcohol use disorders. In the current study, we investigated the effect of an experimental manipulation of response conflict on the amplitude of the P300 component during response inhibition, and examined whether individual differences in the amplitude of this P300 component would predict voluntary ad-lib alcohol consumption, in social drinkers. Using a repeated measures design, 16 participants performed a stop-signal task after receiving instructions that either emphasised or de-emphasised response conflict while their electroencephalogram (EEG) was concurrently recorded, before their ad-lib drinking was assessed. Results revealed that task instructions had the predicted effects on behavioural indices of response inhibition and the associated P300 components. Most importantly, individual differences in the amplitude of P300 subcomponents during response inhibition were negatively correlated with ad-lib alcohol consumption. Results provide the first experimental support for theoretical models that posit that reduced amplitude of the P300 during response inhibition is associated with alcohol-seeking behaviour in humans.
23142559	TNF-α-induced CXCL8 production by A549 cells: involvement of the non-neuronal cholinergic system.	It was recently suggested that the non-neuronal cholinergic system has a regulatory role in pulmonary inflammation. We investigated this system's involvement in the control of cytokine production by the A549 human alveolar epithelial cell line. CXCL8 and acetylcholine (ACh) concentrations were measured using ELISA and LC-MS/MS, respectively. The mRNA expression of muscarinic receptor (MR) subtypes was determined using RT-PCR. In A549 cells, TNF-α increased the release of CXCL8 and ACh and the expression of the subtype 3 MR (M3R). Furthermore, TNF-α-induced CXCL8 secretion was (i) inhibited by the MR antagonist tiotropium and the M3R antagonist 4-DAMP and (ii) enhanced by the M1/M3R agonist pilocarpine and the cholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine. Taken as a whole, these results suggest that ACh release by A549 cells enhances TNF-α-induced CXCL8 secretion through activation of the M3R. Western blot analysis revealed that pilocarpine and physostigmine enhanced the TNF-α-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK and the degradation of IκBα. Inhibition of these pathways with specific inhibitors abrogated the pilocarpine-induced CXCL8 release. Our results suggest that the TNF-α-induced secretion of CXCL8 in A549 cells is regulated by the release of ACh, the latter's binding to the M3R and the downstream activation of NF-κB and the ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK signaling pathways. Our findings suggest that MR antagonists may have anti-inflammatory effects by preventing pro-inflammatory events driven by endogenous, non-neuronal ACh.
23355467	Role of fat body lipogenesis in protection against the effects of caloric overload in Drosophila.	The Drosophila fat body is a liver- and adipose-like tissue that stores fat and serves as a detoxifying and immune responsive organ. We have previously shown that a high sugar diet leads to elevated hemolymph glucose and systemic insulin resistance in developing larvae and adults. Here, we used stable isotope tracer feeding to demonstrate that rearing larvae on high sugar diets impaired the synthesis of esterified fatty acids from dietary glucose. Fat body lipid profiling revealed changes in both carbon chain length and degree of unsaturation of fatty acid substituents, particularly in stored triglycerides. We tested the role of the fat body in larval tolerance of caloric excess. Our experiments demonstrated that lipogenesis was necessary for animals to tolerate high sugar feeding as tissue-specific loss of orthologs of carbohydrate response element-binding protein or stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 resulted in lethality on high sugar diets. By contrast, increasing the fat content of the fat body by knockdown of king-tubby was associated with reduced hyperglycemia and improved growth and tolerance of high sugar diets. Our work supports a critical role for the fat body and the Drosophila carbohydrate response element-binding protein ortholog in metabolic homeostasis in Drosophila.
19836445	Screening for (anti)androgenic properties using a standard operation protocol based on the human stably transfected androgen sensitive PALM cell line. First steps towards validation.	Despite more than a decade of research in the field of endocrine active compounds targeting the androgen receptor (AR), and although suitable cell lines can be obtained, no validated human stably transfected androgen sensitive transactivation assay is available. Bayer Schering Pharma (BSP) and the Flemish Institute for Technological Research (VITO), partners within the EU-sponsored 6th framework project ReProTect, made first steps towards such a validation. A standard operation protocol (SOP) developed at BSP based on the androgen sensitive PALM cell line was transferred to VITO and its performance and transferability were thoroughly studied. The investigation followed a generic protocol prepared for all reporter gene assays evaluated within ReProTect, and in both laboratories at least three independent experiments were performed. The highest concentration to be tested was limited to 10 microM, if needed. A few compounds, 17alpha-methyltestosterone (17alpha-MT), vinclozolin and linuron, were studied using a real world scenario, i.e., assuming that their interaction with the AR was not known: A prescreening for agonism and true, competitive antagonism was used to select conditions such as the appropriate mode of action, and the working range excluding cytotoxicity for the final screening. All other compounds were tested according to the generic protocol: Compounds screened for agonism were the reference androgen 17alpha-methyldihydrotestosterone (MDHT), levonorgestrel, norethynodrel, progesterone, o,p'-DDT, and dibutylphthalate (DBP), while compounds screened for antagonism were the reference anti-androgen flutamide, prochloraz, o,p'-DDT, progesterone, norethynodrel, and DBP. Cytotoxicity was assessed in parallel as lactate dehydrogenase release. The prescreen classified 17alpha-MT as androgenic, vinclozolin and linuron as anti-androgenic and compounds were tested accordingly. In the absence of cytotoxicity, appropriate androgenic properties of reference and test compounds were detected by both laboratories, o,p'-DDT and DBP had no androgenic activity. Across the two laboratories EC(50)-values for MDHT, 17alpha-MT, and levonorgestrel varied by not more than a factor of 3.4, for norethynodrel by a factor of 9.7. Progesterone effects could not fully be evaluated, as frequently concentration response curves were incomplete. In the absence of cytotoxicity anti-androgenic properties of reference and test compounds were also detected in both laboratories. DBP, the putative negative reference compound, was inactive, norethynodrel rather showed agonistic properties. Progesterone was an antagonist at low concentrations, but agonistic properties were observed in one laboratory at high concentrations. Since the highest test concentration was limited to 10 microM, for some compounds no complete concentration response curves were obtained and estimation of EC(50)-values was less robust. Our data demonstrated that the SOP was transferable, and that the assay was able to rank compounds with strong, weak, and without affinity for the AR and to discriminate agonists and antagonists. The sensitivity of the assay could be improved further, if the limit of solubility or beginning cytotoxicity was chosen as the highest test concentration. The assay avoids the use of tissues from laboratory animals, and thus contributes to the 3R concept. Furthermore, it could be adjusted to an intermediate/high throughput format. On the whole, this PALM assay is a promising candidate for further validation.
10231134	Is phentermine an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase? A critical appraisal.	Phentermine produces a spectrum of concentration-dependent biochemical effects. It interacts with NE transporters at 0.1 microM, DA transporters at about 1 microM, 5-HT transporters at 15 microM and MAO-A at about 100 microM. When administered at typical anorectic doses, phentermine primarily interacts with DA and NE transporters and does not produce biochemical or neurochemical effects which would occur if it were inhibiting MAO-A. Some other explanation other than MAO inhibition must be sought to explain how oral phentermine increases platelet 5-HT, since platelet MAO-B does not metabolize platelet 5-HT, and since amphetamine-type drugs are even weaker inhibitors of MAO-B than MAO-A. Clinical studies in humans have shown that amphetamine, which is a more potent inhibitor of MAO-A than phentermine, does not inhibit MAO-A at therapeutic doses. Neither phentermine alone, fluoxetine alone or their combined use have been associated with cardiac valvulopathy, and clinical experience has shown their combined use to be free of significant adverse effects. Viewed collectively, there appears to be no data to support the hypothesis that phentermine inhibits MAO at typical therapeutic doses.
8922768	The reversal of profound mivacurium-induced neuromuscular blockade.	PURPOSE: Mivacurium is metabolized by plasma cholinesterase catalyzed ester hydrolysis. Acetylcholinesterase antagonists used in the reversal of muscle relaxation may also inhibit plasma cholinesterase and, therefore, delay the hydrolysis of mivacurium. The clinical interaction between acetylcholinesterase antagonists and mivacurium induced neuromuscular blockade was studied. METHOD: Intraoperative muscle relaxation was maintained with a mivacurium infusion to achieve a constant intense block (first twitch, T1, 2-3% of control). Patients were randomly divided into three groups. Patients in Group 1 received no anticholinesterase, in Group 2 neostigmine 0.07 mg.kg-1, and in Group 3 edrophonium 1 mg.kg-1. The times between termination of the mivacurium infusion (Group 1) or the administration of the anticholinesterase (Groups 2 and 3) to 25%, 50%, 75% and 95% T1 recovery, and to 50%, 70% and 90% recovery in the ratio, T4/T1 (TR) were recorded. RESULT: In the neostigmine Group, T1 recovery to 25%, 50% and 75% (2.32 +/- 1.41, 3.90 +/- 1.85 and 6.88 +/- 2.66 min) was accelerated compared with control (3.36 +/- 1.34, 5.78 +/- 2.22, and 8.58 +/- 3.60, and), but recovery to 95% (18.53 +/- 9.09 vs 13.29 +/- 5.24 min) was delayed. Also, TR recovery to 50%, 70%, and 90% was slower (14.47 +/- 8.73, 21.25 +/- 11.06 and 31.37 +/- 12.11 min vs 11.75 +/- 3.74, 13.78 +/- 4.39 and 17.86 +/- 6.44 min). However, all T1 and TR recovery times were decreased in the edrophonium group (0.88 +/- 0.51, 2.00 +/- 1.50, 4.97 +/- 2.96, and 9.35 +/- 5.24 min for T1 and 6.86 +/- 3.93, 9.05 +/- 4.51 and 12.24 +/- 6.66 min for TR). CONCLUSION: Neostigmine reversal of intense mivacurium neuromuscular block should be avoided, as this may result in prolongation of the block.
23378608	Apelin inhibits diet-induced obesity by enhancing lymphatic and blood vessel integrity.	Angiogenesis is tightly associated with the outgrowth of adipose tissue, leading to obesity, which is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes and hypertension, mainly because expanding adipose tissue requires an increased nutrient supply from blood vessels. Therefore, induction of vessel abnormality by adipokines has been well studied, whereas how altered vascular function promotes obesity is relatively unexplored. Also, surviving Prox1 heterozygous mice showed abnormal lymphatic patterning and adult-onset obesity, indicating that accumulation of adipocytes could be closely linked with lymphatic function. Here we propose a new anti-obesity strategy based on enhancement of lymphatic and blood vessel integrity with apelin. Apelin-knockout mice given a high-fat diet showed an obese phenotype associated with abnormal lymphatic and blood vessel enlargement. Fatty acids present in the high-fat diet induced hyperpermeability of endothelial cells, causing adipocyte differentiation, whereas apelin promoted vascular stabilization. Moreover, treatment of high-fat-diet-fed apelin-knockout mice with a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, improved vascular function, and also attenuated obesity. Finally, apelin transgenic mice showed decreased subcutaneous adipose tissue owing to inhibition of high-fat-diet-induced hyperpermeability of vessels. These results indicate that apelin inhibits high-fat-diet-induced obesity by enhancing vessel integrity. Apelin could serve as a therapeutic target for treating obesity and related diseases.
12204108	Effects of pravastatin sodium on mevalonate metabolism in common marmosets.	In experimental animals and humans, the concentration of serum mevalonate (MVA), a direct product of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, is considered to reflect the activity of whole-body sterol synthesis. The relationship between the concentration of serum MVA and the activity of sterol synthesis in tissues, however, has not been fully clarified. In the present study, we examined MVA metabolism by using pravastatin, a liver-selective inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, and common marmosets, a good model animal for studying lipid metabolism. In the time course study, the maximal reduction in the concentration of serum MVA was observed 2 h after a single oral administration of 30 mg/kg pravastatin to common marmosets. We, therefore, examined the relationship between the concentrations of serum and hepatic MVA, and sterol synthesis in some tissues at this time point. Sterol synthesis was determined ex vivo in tissue slices by measuring the incorporation of [14C]acetate into digitonin-precipitable [14C]sterols. Pravastatin at 0.03-30 mg/kg reduced dose-dependently the activity of hepatic sterol synthesis, whereas no significant reduction of sterol synthesis was observed in other tissues such as intestine, kidney, testis and spleen, even with the highest dose (30 mg/kg). The liver-specific inhibition of sterol synthesis caused parallel reductions in the concentrations of both serum and liver MVA. In addition, there were good correlations between the concentration of either serum or hepatic MVA and the activity of hepatic sterol synthesis. These data indicate that the major origin of serum MVA is the liver, and that the concentration of serum MVA reflects the concentration of hepatic MVA and the activity of hepatic sterol synthesis 2 h after a single oral administration of pravastatin in common marmosets.
17016511	Inhibition of cardiac voltage-gated sodium channels by grape polyphenols.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The cardiovascular benefits of red wine consumption are often attributed to the antioxidant effects of its polyphenolic constituents, including quercetin, catechin and resveratrol. Inhibition of cardiac voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) is antiarrhythmic and cardioprotective. As polyphenols may also modulate ion channels, and possess structural similarities to several antiarrhythmic VGSC inhibitors, we hypothesised that VGSC inhibition may contribute to cardioprotection by these polyphenols. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The whole-cell voltage-clamp technique was used to record peak and late VGSC currents (INa) from recombinant human heart NaV1.5 channels expressed in tsA201 cells. Right ventricular myocytes from rat heart were isolated and single myocytes were field-stimulated. Either calcium transients or contractility were measured using the calcium-sensitive dye Calcium-Green 1AM or video edge detection, respectively. KEY RESULTS: The red grape polyphenols quercetin, catechin and resveratrol blocked peak INa with IC50s of 19.4 microM, 76.8 microM and 77.3 microM, respectively. In contrast to lidocaine, resveratrol did not exhibit any frequency-dependence of peak INa block. Late INa induced by the VGSC long QT mutant R1623Q was reduced by resveratrol and quercetin. Resveratrol and quercetin also blocked late INa induced by the toxin, ATX II, with IC50s of 26.1 microM and 24.9 microM, respectively. In field-stimulated myocytes, ATXII-induced increases in diastolic calcium were prevented and reversed by resveratrol. ATXII-induced contractile dysfunction was delayed and reduced by resveratrol. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our results indicate that several red grape polyphenols inhibit cardiac VGSCs and that this effect may contribute to the documented cardioprotective efficacy of red grape products.
23376120	Gastrodin attenuation of the inflammatory response in H9c2 cardiomyocytes involves inhibition of NF-κB and MAPKs activation via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling.	The phenolic glucoside gastrodin, a main constituent of a Chinese traditional herbal medicine, has been known to display several biological and pharmacological properties. However, the role and precise molecular mechanisms explaining how gastrodin suppresses the inflammatory response in septic cardiac dysfunction are unknown. To study this, rat H9c2 cardiomyocytes were treated with gastrodin and/or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Our results showed that gastrodin treatment strongly suppressed nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) family activation and upregulation of the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in LPS-stimulated H9c2 cardiomyocytes. Simultaneously, gastrodin obviously upregulated the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt signaling in a dose-dependent manner. However, wortmannin, a specific PI3-K inhibitor, blocked the inhibitory effects of gastrodin on LPS-stimulated H9c2 cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, PI3-K/Akt inhibition partially abolished the inhibitory effects of gastrodin on the phosphorylation of inhibitor κB-α (IκB-α), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), and activity of NF-κB. Here we report activation of the PI3-K/Akt signaling by gastrodin and that inhibition of this pathway reverses the inhibitory effects of gastrodin on NF-κB and MAPKs activation in H9c2 cardiomyocytes.
23042952	Differential cell-protective function of two resveratrol (trans-3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) glucosides against oxidative stress.	Resveratrol (trans-3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene; RSV), a natural polyphenol, exerts a beneficial effect on health and diseases. RSV targets and activates the NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylase SIRT1; in turn, SIRT1 induces an intracellular antioxidative mechanism by inducing mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD2). Most RSV found in plants is glycosylated, and the effect of these glycosylated forms on SIRT1 has not been studied. In this study, we compared the effects of RSV and two glycosyl RSVs, resveratrol-3-O-β-d-glucoside (3G-RSV; polydatin/piceid) and resveratrol-4'-O-β-d-glucoside (4'G-RSV), at the cellular level. In oxygen radical absorbance capacity and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging assays, the antioxidant activity of 3G-RSV was comparable to that of RSV, whereas the radical-scavenging efficiency of 4'G-RSV was less than 50% of that of RSV. However, 4'G-RSV, but not 3G-RSV, induced SIRT1-dependent histone H3 deacetylation and SOD2 expression in mouse C2C12 skeletal myoblasts; as with RSV, SIRT1 knockdown blunted these effects. RSV and 4'G-RSV, but not 3G-RSV, mitigated oxidative stress-induced cell death in C2C12 cells and primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. RSV and 4'G-RSV inhibited C2C12 cell proliferation, but 3G-RSV did not. RSV was found in both the intracellular and extracellular fractions of C2C12 cells that had been incubated with 4'G-RSV, indicating that 4'G-RSV was extracellularly deglycosylated to RSV, which was then taken up by the cells. C2C12 cells did not deglycosylate 3G-RSV. Our results point to 4'G-RSV as a useful RSV prodrug with high water solubility. These data also show that the in vitro antioxidative activity of these molecules did not correlate with their ability to protect cells from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis.
10434156	[Psychopharmacological profile of venlafaxine].	Venlafaxine is an antidepressant which blocks reuptake of noradrenaline and serotonin and, to a lesser extent, dopamine. These data have been confirmed by behavioral tests. It has been shown that by decreasing the overall cerebral quantity of 5-HT and NA, venlafaxine continued to have an antidepressant action in animal models. In addition, the drug has been shown to act preferentially on 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors.
23374869	Inhibition of monoamine oxidase by phthalide analogues.	Based on recent reports that the small molecules, isatin and phthalimide, are suitable scaffolds for the design of high potency monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, the present study examines the MAO inhibitory properties of a series of phthalide [2-benzofuran-1(3H)-one] analogues. Phthalide is structurally related to isatin and phthalimide and it is demonstrated here that substitution at C6 of the phthalide moiety yields compounds endowed with high binding affinities to both human MAO isoforms. Among the nineteen homologues evaluated, the lowest IC(50) values recorded for the inhibition of MAO-A and -B were 0.096 and 0.0014 μM, respectively. In most instances, C6-substituted phthalides exhibit MAO-B specific inhibition. Among a series of 6-benzyloxyphthalides bearing substituents on the para position of the phenyl ring the general order of potency was CF(3) > I > Br > Cl > F > CH(3) > H. The results also show that the binding modes of representative phthalides are reversible and competitive at both MAO isoforms. Based on these data, C6-substituted phthalides may serve as leads for the development of therapies for neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease.
10381787	Dose-dependent inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase-1 and monocyte cyclooxygenase-2 by meloxicam in healthy subjects.	We evaluated whether therapeutic blood levels of meloxicam are associated with selective inhibition of monocyte cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in vitro and ex vivo. Concentration-response curves for the inhibition of monocyte COX-2 and platelet COX-1 were obtained in vitro after the incubation of meloxicam with whole blood samples. Moreover, 11 healthy volunteers received placebo or 7.5 or 15 mg/day meloxicam, each treatment for 7 consecutive days, according to a randomized, double-blind, crossover design. Before dosing and 24 h after the seventh dose of each regimen, heparinized whole blood samples were incubated with lipopolysaccharide (10 microgram/ml) for 24 h at 37 degrees C, and prostaglandin E2 was measured in plasma as an index of monocyte COX-2 activity. The production of thromboxane B2 in whole blood allowed to clot at 37 degrees C for 60 min was assessed as an index of platelet COX-1 activity. The administration of placebo did not significantly affect plasma prostaglandin E2 (21. 3 +/- 7.5 versus 19.1 +/- 4 ng/ml, mean +/- S.D., n = 11) or serum thromboxane B2 (426 +/- 167 versus 425 +/- 150 ng/ml) levels. In contrast, the administration of 7.5 and 15 mg of meloxicam caused dose-dependent reductions in monocyte COX-2 activity by 51% and 70%, respectively, and in platelet COX-1 activity by 25% and 35%, respectively. Although the IC50 value of meloxicam for inhibition of COX-1 was 10-fold higher than the IC50 value of COX-2 in vitro, this biochemical selectivity was inadequate to clearly separate the effects of meloxicam on the two isozymes after oral dosing as a function of the daily dose and interindividual variation in steady-state plasma levels.
23499662	The bizarre pharmacology of the ATP release channel pannexin1.	Pannexins were originally thought to represent a second and redundant family of gap junction proteins in addition to the well characterized connexins. However, it is now evident that pannexins function as unapposed membrane channels and the major role of Panx1 is that of an ATP release channel. Despite the contrasting functional roles, connexins, innexins and pannexins share pharmacological properties. Most gap junction blockers also attenuate the function of Panx1, including carbenoxolone, mefloquine and flufenamic acid. However, in contrast to connexin based gap junction channels, Panx1 channel activity can be attenuated by several groups of drugs hitherto considered very specific for other proteins. The drugs affecting Panx1 channels include several transport inhibitors, chloride channel blockers, mitochondrial inhibitors, P2X7 receptor ligands, inflammasome inhibitors and malaria drugs. These observations indicate that Panx1 may play an extended role in a wider spectrum of physiological functions. Alternatively, Panx1 may share structural domains with other proteins, not readily revealed by sequence alignments. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Connexin based channels'
16472148	Cilostazol: therapeutic potential against focal cerebral ischemic damage.	Cilostazol was developed as a selective inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3). The anti-platelet and vasodilator properties of cilostazol have been extensively characterized and considered to contribute to the variety of clinical effects such as intermittent claudication and recurrent stroke. In this review, the novel action mechanism (s) of cilostazol are overviewed with the focus on the action of cilostazol in in vitro and in vivo studies as a maxi-K channel opener targeting anti-apoptotic signaling pathways. Under treatment with cilostazol (10 mg/kg intravenously or 30 mg/kg orally), a significant reduction in cerebral infarct area was evident in rats subjected to ischemia/reperfusion. Increase in cyclic AMP and decrease in TNF-alpha levels were identified in the ipsilateral cortex under treatment with cilostazol accompanied by decreased Bax formation and cytochrome c release with increased Bcl-2 production in the penumbral area as well as in the in vitro human umbilical endothelial cells. Cilostazol suppressed TNF-alpha-induced decrease in viability of SK-N-SH (human neuroblastoma) cells and HCN-1A (human cortical neuron) cells in association with decrease in PTEN phosphorylation and increase in Akt/CREB phosphorylation with suppression of DNA fragmentation, all of which were antagonized by iberiotoxin, a maxi-K(+) channel blocker. Further, cilostazol prevented TNF-alpha-induced PTEN phosphorylation and apoptotic cell death via increased CK2 phosphorylation in the SK-N-SH cells. Cilostazol increased K(+) current in SK-N-SH cells by opening the maxi-K channels. Thus, it was suggested that the action of cilostazol to promote cell survival was ascribed to the maxi-K channel opening-coupled upregulation of CK2 phosphorylation and downregulation of PTEN phosphorylation with resultant increased phosphorylation of Akt and CREB. These in vitro data were confirmed in the in vivo results of rats subjected to focal transient ischemic damage.
23265901	Synthesis and evaluation of 8-oxoadenine derivatives as potent Toll-like receptor 7 agonists with high water solubility.	We report the discovery of novel series of highly potent TLR7 agonists based on 8-oxoadenines, 1 and 2 by introducing and optimizing various tertiary amines onto the N(9)-position of the adenine moiety. The introduction of the amino group resulted in not only improved water solubility but also enhanced TLR7 agonistic activity. In particular compound 20 (DSR-6434) indicated an optimal balance between the agonistic potency and high water solubility. It also demonstrated a strong antitumor effect in vivo by intravenous administration in a tumor bearing mice model.
15714982	[Treatment of androgen-independent hormone refractory prostate cancer using docetaxel].	Although prostate cancer patients with metastatic lesion initially respond to androgen ablation therapy, almost patients develop to hormone-refractory states. The optimal treatment for men with hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) has not been established. Docetaxel is a semisynthetic taxane that inhibit tumor growth by induction of microtubule stabilization and promotion of bcl-2 inactivation, which induce apoptosis. Docetaxel as single agent has significant anti-tumor effect in HRPC patients. Docetaxel combined with estramustine or other antimicrotubular agents have shown further significant cytotoxicity in HRPC patients. In the United States, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved docetaxel, injection in combination with prednisone for the treatment of patients with advanced metastatic prostate cancer in 2004.
19531491	Novel inhibitors complexed with glutamate dehydrogenase: allosteric regulation by control of protein dynamics.	Mammalian glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) is a homohexameric enzyme that catalyzes the reversible oxidative deamination of l-glutamate to 2-oxoglutarate using NAD(P)(+) as coenzyme. Unlike its counterparts from other animal kingdoms, mammalian GDH is regulated by a host of ligands. The recently discovered hyperinsulinism/hyperammonemia disorder showed that the loss of allosteric inhibition of GDH by GTP causes excessive secretion of insulin. Subsequent studies demonstrated that wild-type and hyperinsulinemia/hyperammonemia forms of GDH are inhibited by the green tea polyphenols, epigallocatechin gallate and epicatechin gallate. This was followed by high throughput studies that identified more stable inhibitors, including hexachlorophene, GW5074, and bithionol. Shown here are the structures of GDH complexed with these three compounds. Hexachlorophene forms a ring around the internal cavity in GDH through aromatic stacking interactions between the drug and GDH as well as between the drug molecules themselves. In contrast, GW5074 and bithionol both bind as pairs of stacked compounds at hexameric 2-fold axes between the dimers of subunits. The internal core of GDH contracts when the catalytic cleft closes during enzymatic turnover. None of the drugs cause conformational changes in the contact residues, but all bind to key interfaces involved in this contraction process. Therefore, it seems likely that the drugs inhibit enzymatic turnover by inhibiting this transition. Indeed, this expansion/contraction process may play a major role in the inter-subunit communication and allosteric regulation observed in GDH.
16885432	Modafinil occupies dopamine and norepinephrine transporters in vivo and modulates the transporters and trace amine activity in vitro.	2-[(Diphenylmethyl) sulfinyl]acetamide (modafinil), prescribed principally to treat narcolepsy, is undergoing assessment for other neuropsychiatric disorders and medical conditions. The neurochemical substrates of modafinil are unresolved. We postulated that modafinil enhances wakefulness by modulating dopamine (DAT), norepinephrine (NET), or serotonin (SERT) transporter activities. In vivo, we determined DAT and NET occupancy by modafinil by positron emission tomography imaging; in vitro, we determined modafinil activity at the DAT, NET, SERT, and rhesus monkey trace amine receptor 1 (TA1). In rhesus monkey, modafinil occupancy of striatal DAT was detected by [(11)C]2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-4-(fluorophenyl)tropane and of thalamic NET by [(11)C](S,S)-2-(alpha-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-benzyl)morpholine. In vitro, modafinil effects in DAT-human embryonic kidney (HEK), NET-HEK, and SERT-HEK cells were investigated alone or combined with the TA1 receptor. Modafinil (i.v.) occupied striatal DAT sites (5 mg/kg: 35 +/- 12%, n = 4; 8 mg/kg: 54 +/- 3%, n = 3). In thalamus, modafinil occupied NET sites (5 mg/kg: 16 +/- 7.8%, n = 6; 8 mg/kg: 44 +/- 12%; n = 2). In vitro, modafinil inhibited [(3)H]dopamine (IC(50) = 6.4 microM), [(3)H]norepinephrine (IC(50) = 35.6 microM), and [(3)H]serotonin (IC(50) > 500 microM) transport via the human DAT, NET, and SERT. Modafinil did not activate the TA1 receptor in TA1-HEK cells, but it augmented a monoamine transporter-dependent enhancement of phenethylamine activation of TA1 in TA1-DAT and TA1-NET cells, but not in TA1-SERT cells. The present data provide compelling evidence that modafinil occupies the DAT and NET in living brain of rhesus monkeys and raise the possibility that modafinil affects wakefulness by interacting with catecholamine transporters in brain.
2892392	Effect of nizatidine and cimetidine on betazole-stimulated gastric secretion of normal subjects: comparison of effects on acid, water, and pepsin.	The effect of nizatidine, a new histamine H2 receptor antagonist, on gastric secretory function of eight normal subjects stimulated with betazole, was compared with that of cimetidine. Single oral doses of 75 mg, 150 mg, and 300 mg nizatidine, 300 mg cimetidine, and a placebo were administered on separate occasions 1 h before betazole stimulation. Gastric secretions were recovered in 15-min fractions for the ensuing 2 h, and the pH, H+ concentration and output, volume, and pepsin concentration and output were determined. Doses of 150 mg and 300 mg nizatidine depressed the secretory response significantly more than did cimetidine. The antisecretory effects of 75 mg nizatidine was no different than that of 300 mg cimetidine. Nizatidine 300 mg inhibited pepsin output significantly more than volume. Although pepsin concentration was reduced more than volume, the difference was not significant. These observations, in contrast to results of previous studies, suggest a direct inhibition of pepsin secretion, although to a lesser extent than that of acid.
10730683	Orlistat, a new lipase inhibitor for the management of obesity.	Orlistat, a weight-loss agent with a novel mechanism of action, recently was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of obesity. It inhibits gastric and pancreatic lipases in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract to decrease systemic absorption of dietary fat. In several trials lasting up to 2 years, orlistat was more effective than diet alone for weight reduction and maintenance of lost weight. Orlistat treatment also results in modest improvements in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, blood pressure, and fasting glucose and insulin concentrations. The major adverse effects are gastrointestinal, usually occur early in therapy, and tend to decrease with continued treatment. Because orlistat may decrease the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, a standard multiple-vitamin supplement is recommended daily during therapy to prevent abnormalities in vitamin serum concentrations. The potential for severe gastrointestinal discomfort and the modest degree of weight loss may limit the agent's clinical utility. Its long-term safety and effectiveness for weight maintenance, cost-effectiveness of treatment, and overall reduction in obesity-related morbidity and mortality remain to be determined.
23500116	Analysis of the enhanced oral bioavailability of fenofibrate lipid formulations in fasted humans using an in vitro-in silico-in vivo approach.	Lipid-based formulations have established a significant role in the formulation of poorly soluble drugs for oral administration. In order to better understand their potential advantages over solid oral dosage forms, we studied the solubility and dissolution/precipitation characteristics of three self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS) formulations and one suspension of micronized fenofibrate in lipid excipients, for which pharmacokinetic studies had already been reported in the open literature. The in vitro dispersion/dissolution studies were carried out in biorelevant media using USP II apparatus. These were followed up by in silico simulations using STELLA® software, in which not only dispersion/dissolution, but also the precipitation and re-dissolution of fenofibrate was taken into account. While unformulated drug exhibited poor solubility (0.22μg/mL in FaSSGF and 4.31μg/mL in FaSSIF-V2(PO4)) and dissolved less than 2% in dissolution tests, the solubility of fenofibrate in the presence of the lipid excipients increased dramatically (e.g., to 65.44μg/mL in the presence of the Myritol 318/TPGS/Tween 80 SMEDDS) and there was an attendant increase in the dissolution (over 80% from capsules containing the Myritol 318/TPGS/Tween 80 SMEDDS and about 20% from the dispersion of fenofibrate in lipid excipients). For the four lipid-based fenofibrate formulations studied, combining in vitro data in biorelevant media with in silico simulation resulted in accurate prediction of the in vivo human plasma profiles. The point estimates of Cmax and AUC ratio calculated from the in silico and in vivo plasma profiles fell within the 0.8-1.25 range for the SMEDDS solution and capsule formulations, suggesting an accurate simulation of the in vivo profiles. This similarity was confirmed by calculation of the respective f2 factors. Sensitivity analysis of the simulation profiles revealed that the SMEDDS formulations had virtually removed any dependency of absorption on the dissolution rate in the small intestine, whereas for the dispersion in lipid excipients, this barrier remained. Such results pave the way to optimizing the performance of oral lipid-based formulations via an in vitro-in silico-in vivo approach.
17192395	Comparative gene expression profiling of in vitro differentiated megakaryocytes and erythroblasts identifies novel activatory and inhibitory platelet membrane proteins.	To identify previously unknown platelet receptors we compared the transcriptomes of in vitro differentiated megakaryocytes (MKs) and erythroblasts (EBs). RNA was obtained from purified, biologically paired MK and EB cultures and compared using cDNA microarrays. Bioinformatical analysis of MK-up-regulated genes identified 151 transcripts encoding transmembrane domain-containing proteins. Although many of these were known platelet genes, a number of previously unidentified or poorly characterized transcripts were also detected. Many of these transcripts, including G6b, G6f, LRRC32, LAT2, and the G protein-coupled receptor SUCNR1, encode proteins with structural features or functions that suggest they may be involved in the modulation of platelet function. Immunoblotting on platelets confirmed the presence of the encoded proteins, and flow cytometric analysis confirmed the expression of G6b, G6f, and LRRC32 on the surface of platelets. Through comparative analysis of expression in platelets and other blood cells we demonstrated that G6b, G6f, and LRRC32 are restricted to the platelet lineage, whereas LAT2 and SUCNR1 were also detected in other blood cells. The identification of the succinate receptor SUCNR1 in platelets is of particular interest, because physiologically relevant concentrations of succinate were shown to potentiate the effect of low doses of a variety of platelet agonists.
10494028	Cell culture conditions determine apolipoprotein CIII secretion and regulation by fibrates in human hepatoma HepG2 cells.	Fibrates are widely used drugs which lower triglycerides and increase HDL concentrations in serum. Recent findings from our laboratory have shown that fibrates repress apolipoprotein (apo) CIII gene expression, an effect that explains partially the triglyceride-lowering activity of these drugs. The goal of the present study was to compare the effect of various fibrates on apo CIII gene expression in the human hepatoblastoma cell line HepG2. First, we demonstrate that the level of apo CIII secretion by HepG2 cells is controlled by serum factors whereas apo CIII mRNA levels are not and even increase under conditions when apo CIII secretion dramatically decreases. Twelve different fetal calf serum batches were tested during this study and apo CIII secretion in cell medium could only be detected with three of them. The effect of serum on apolipoprotein secretion was more pronounced for apo CIII whereas other apolipoproteins (apo E, apo B, apo AII and apo AI) were affected to a lesser extent. Under serum conditions allowing apo CIII secretion, treatment with the peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)alpha activators fenofibrate, gemfibrozil and Wy-14643 result in a marked lowering of apo CIII secretion and gene expression, this effect being most pronounced with Wy-14643. Comparison of the activity of a PPARgamma-specific ligand, the antidiabetic thiazolidinedione, BRL-49653 and a PPARalpha ligand Wy-14643 showed a marked decrease of apo CIII secretion and gene expression after activation of PPARalpha but not PPARgamma. In conclusion, fibrates down-regulate apo CIII gene expression in human HepG2 cells, most likely via PPARalpha but not via PPARgamma. However, these effects are only observed in HepG2 cells cultured under appropriate conditions.
23265505	Influence of extraction procedures on phenolic content and antioxidant activity of Cretan barberry herb.	The main goal of present study was the development, optimization and application of different extraction protocols, especially those employing green technologies, in order to obtain from Berberis cretica extracts with high antioxidant capacity. For this purpose, the applied methods: maceration, ASE and SFE coupled with ASE were incorporated. The antioxidant assessment was carried out using DPPH and total phenolic content (Folin-Ciocalteu) assays. Major constituents were elucidated using HPLC-DAD and UHPLC-HRMS/MS (hybrid IT-Orbital trap spectrometer) equipped with an ESI probe. The chromatographic and spectral data revealed the presence of several simple phenolic acids, derivatives of both caffeic and benzoic acids, and flavonoids in the produced extracts. It was clearly evidenced that the extraction method and solvents used affected both the activity and the chemical content of the results, significantly. The most beneficial conditions were calculated for methanol and water:ethanol (50:50) extracts derived from the combination of SFE and ASE methodologies. Obtained results classify Cretan barberry as a strong antioxidant agent.
2347042	Oncolytic activity and mechanism of action of a novel L-cysteine derivative, L-cysteine, ethyl ester, S-(N-methylcarbamate) monohydrochloride.	A study on the oncolytic activity of the L-cysteine derivative L-cysteine, ethyl ester, S-(N-methylcarbamate) monohydrochloride (NSC 303861), revealed that the drug caused complete regression of the MX-1 human mammary tumor xenograft. The compound also exhibited moderate antitumor activity against murine leukemia P388 (T/C value of 169% at a daily dose of 400 mg/kg) and against M5076 sarcoma (T/C value of 135% at a daily dose of 600 mg/kg). The drug was inactive against B16 melanoma, Lewis lung, colon 38 and CD8F1 mammary carcinomas. The compound exhibited significant cytotoxicity against hepatoma 3924A cells in culture (LC50 = 6 microM). Studies on the mechanism of action revealed that the cytotoxicity of the drug could be partially abrogated by protecting hepatoma 3924A cells in culture with L-glutamine. At 6 h after injection of the compound (400 mg/kg) into rats bearing hepatoma 3924A, the pools of L-glutamine and L-glutamate in the tumor decreased to 33% and 71%, respectively, of control levels; the drug selectively inhibited the activities of L-glutamine-requiring enzymes of purine nucleotide biosynthesis, amidophosphoribosyltransferase, FGAM synthase, and GMP synthase, to 21%, 1%, and 69%, respectively, without significantly altering the activities of pyrimidine biosynthetic enzymes, carbamoylphosphate synthase II and CTP synthase. Measurement of the nucleotide concentrations further corroborated the actions of the drug on the purine nucleotide biosynthetic enzyme activities. Drug injection (400 mg/kg) in the hepatoma 3924A-bearing rats reduced the concentrations of IMP in the tumor to 52%, those of total adenylates to 52%, those of total guanylates to 57%, and those of NAD to 73%, without significantly perturbing the pyrimidine nucleotide pools. Studies on the mechanism of action of the L-cysteine derivative suggested that the compound behaved as an L-glutamine antagonist, selectively acting on the enzymes of purine nucleotide biosynthesis.
18715952	Tumor-growth-promoting cyclooxygenase-2 prostaglandin E2 pathway provides medulloblastoma therapeutic targets.	Prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) has been shown to play important roles in several aspects of tumor development and progression. PGE(2) is synthesized from arachidonic acid by cyclooxygenases (COX) and prostaglandin E synthases (PGES) and mediates its biological activity through binding to the four prostanoid receptors EP(1) through EP(4). In this study, we show for the first time that medulloblastoma (MB), the most common malignant childhood brain tumor, expresses high levels of COX-2, microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1, and EP(1) through EP(4) and secretes PGE(2). PGE(2) and the EP(2) receptor agonist butaprost stimulated MB cell proliferation. Treatment of MB cells with COX inhibitors suppressed PGE(2) production and induced caspase-dependent apoptosis. Similarly, specific COX-2 silencing by small interfering RNA inhibited MB cell growth. EP(1) and EP(3) receptor antagonists ONO-8713 and ONO-AE3-240, but not the EP(4) antagonists ONO-AE3-208 and AH 23848, inhibited tumor cell proliferation, indicating the significance of EP(1) and EP(3) but not EP(4) for MB growth. Administration of COX inhibitors at clinically achievable nontoxic concentrations significantly inhibited growth of established human MB xenografts. Apoptosis was increased, proliferation was reduced, and angiogenesis was inhibited in MBs treated with COX inhibitors. This study suggests that PGE(2) is important for MB growth and that therapies targeting the prostanoid metabolic pathway are potentially beneficial and should be tested in clinical settings for treatment of children with MB.
23554071	A Mineral Extract from red Algae Ameliorates Chronic Spontaneous Colitis in IL-10 Deficient Mice in a Mouse Strain Dependent Manner.	Inflammatory bowel disease is an urgent public health problem with a high incidence in developed countries. Alterations of lifestyle or dietary interventions may attenuate the disease progression and increase the efficacy of current therapies. Here we tested the effect of chronic supplementation with a mineral extract from red marine algae - rich in calcium (34%), magnesium, phosphorus, selenium and other trace minerals - in a clinically relevant model of spontaneous enterocolitis, interleukin (IL)-10(-/-) mice. The mineral extract was administered in the drinking water of Il10(-/-) mice on C57BL/6 J and BALB/c strain backgrounds for 25 weeks commencing from 3 to 4 weeks of age. The mineral extract ameliorated the spontaneous development of colitis and severity of disease in Il10(-/-) mice on a C57BL/6 J background. Mineral extract-treated Il10(-/-) C57BL/6 J strain mice had significantly reduced mortality, circulating levels of serum Amyloid A and reduced colonic tissue damage. In contrast, comparable treatment of Il10(-/-) mice on a BALB/c background with the mineral extract did not alter the course of colitis. These data demonstrate that chronic supplementation with a natural mineral extract selectively ameliorates spontaneous mild-moderate colitis in Il10(-/-) mice on a C57BL/6 J, but does not attenuate more moderate-severe colitis in BALB/c strain animals.

17361331	Enhanced expression of DNA topoisomerase II genes in human medulloblastoma and its possible association with etoposide sensitivity.	Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant neuroepithelial tumor of childhood. The DNA topoisomerase II (Topo II) inhibitor etoposide has been widely used for the treatment of MBs; however, it remains unknown whether MB cells are more sensitive to etoposide than other malignant neuroepithelial tumor cells. In this study, we tested the chemosensitivities of malignant neuroepithelial tumors (26 glioblastomas, 9 anaplastic astrocytomas, and 5 MBs) to etoposide and vincristine using the succinate dehydrogenase inhibition test and found that MB cells are more sensitive to etoposide and more resistant to vincristine than other tumor cells. We performed quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction to evaluate the expression of genes related to etoposide sensitivity, and found co-overexpression of DNA topoisomerase II (Topo II) alpha and beta mRNA in MBs. In addition, the levels of Topo IIalpha and beta mRNA in these tumors correlated with etoposide sensitivity. Immunohistochemical studies using surgical samples of these tumors demonstrated that the percentages of Topo IIalpha immunopositive cells (Topo IIalpha labeling index) correlated with those of Ki-67 immunopositive cells (MIB-1 labeling index); however, neither the Topo IIalpha nor the MIB-1 labeling index correlated with the levels of Topo IIalpha mRNA or etoposide sensitivity. Based on these observations, Topo IIalpha and beta mRNA expression, but not the Topo IIalpha labeling index, might be a useful marker for sensitivity to etoposide in human malignant neuroepithelial tumors.
23603059	Arsenic upregulates the expression of angiotensin II Type I receptor in mouse aortic endothelial cells.	Although chronic arsenic exposure is a well-known risk for cardiovascular disease and has a strong correlation with hypertension, the molecular pathogenesis underlying arsenic exposure-induced hypertension remains poorly understood. To delineate the pathogenesis, we examined changes in the mRNA levels of 2 angiotensin II Type I receptor (AT1R) subtypes, AT1AR and AT1BR, in a mouse aortic endothelial cell line, END-D. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed significant increases in the mRNA levels of 2 AT1R subtypes, AT1AR and AT1BR following sodium arsenite (SA) treatment. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that SA increases the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, western blot analysis revealed that SA enhances the phosphorylations of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and activated protein 1 (AP-1). These phosphorylations were inhibited by N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an anti-oxidant. Finally, SA-induced AT1R expression was found to be prevented both by NAC and specific JNK inhibitor, SP6001325, strongly indicating that AT1R upregulation is a result of the ROS-mediated activation of the JNK signaling pathway. Taken together, our results indicate that arsenic indeed upregulates the AT1R expression, thus highlighting a role of arsenic-induced aberrant AT1R signaling in the pathogenesis of hypertension.
23474807	Impact of the virus purification protocol on aggregation and electrokinetics of MS2 phages and corresponding virus-like particles.	Previous experimental and theoretical studies have established that electrokinetic and aggregation properties of soft MS2 phages are not only governed by the physico-chemical features of their proteinaceous outer surface but are also significantly impacted by those of their inner RNA component (Dika et al. Appl. Environ. Microbiol., 2011, 14, 4939-4948). These conclusions contradict the recent findings of Nguyen et al. (Soft Matter, 2011, 7, 10449-10456) who reported identical electrokinetic and aggregation characteristics for MS2 and corresponding virus like particles (VLPs) that lack the internal RNA component. We demonstrate here that this contradiction originates from the different purification methods adopted prior to measurements. More generally, we show that stability and electrohydrodynamics of viruses differ according to purification by (i) dialysis, (ii) isopycnic centrifugation in the cesium chloride gradient, and (iii) precipitation using polyethylene glycol (PEG). Methods (i) and (iii) lead to aggregation of MS2 phages at pH ≤ 4 and pH ≤ 6 in 1-100 mM NaNO3 solutions, respectively, while under such conditions aggregation is not observed for MS2 and VLP suspensions prepared according to (ii). In addition, VLPs prepared following methods (i) and (iii) aggregate only at the isoelectric point (pH ~ 3-4) in 1 mM NaNO3 solution. Electrophoretic mobility data of stable MS2 and VLP particles were further examined using a recent formalism for electrokinetics of soft multilayered colloids. The analysis qualitatively shows how the purification protocol may affect either the outer particle surface properties and/or the inner particle content. Finally, the non-DLVO aggregation behavior of MS2 and VLPs purified via the above protocols is discussed in terms of the possible change in corresponding interparticular interactions.
7680751	Cloning and expression of a novel serotonin receptor with high affinity for tricyclic psychotropic drugs.	We have used the polymerase chain reaction technique to selectively amplify a guanine nucleotide-binding protein-coupled receptor cDNA sequence from rat striatal mRNA that exhibits high homology to previously cloned serotonin receptors. Sequencing of a full length clone isolated from a rat striatal cDNA library revealed an open reading frame of 1311 base pairs, encoding a 437-residue protein with seven hydrophobic regions. Within these hydrophobic regions, this receptor was found to be 41-36% identical to the following serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] receptors: 5-HT2 > 5-HT1D > 5-HT1C > 5-HT1B > 5-HT1A > 5-HT1E. Northern blots revealed a approximately 4.2-kilobase transcript localized in various brain regions, with the following rank order of abundance: striatum >> olfactory tubercle > cerebral cortex > hippocampus. Expression of this clone in COS-7 cells resulted in the appearance of high affinity, saturable binding of (+)-[2-125I] iodolysergic acid diethylamide ([125I]LSD) with a Kd of 1.26 nM. Among endogenous biogenic amines, only 5-HT completely inhibited [125I]LSD binding (Ki = 150 nM). The inhibition of [125I]LSD binding by other serotonergic agonists and antagonists revealed a pharmacological profile that does not correlate with that of any previously described serotonin receptor subtype. In addition, this receptor exhibits high affinity for a number of tricyclic antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs, including clozapine, amoxipine, and amitriptyline. In HEK-293 cells stably transfected with this receptor, serotonin elicits a potent stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity, which is blocked by antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs. The distinct structural and pharmacological properties of this receptor site indicate that it represents a completely novel subtype of serotonin receptor. Based on its affinity for tricyclic psychotropic drugs and its localization to limbic and cortical regions of the brain, it is likely that this receptor may play a role in several neuropsychiatric disorders that involve serotonergic systems.
22258629	Toxic effects of chromium on tannery workers at Sialkot (Pakistan).	Chromium is widely used in the leather industry, and tannery workers are under constant threat of adverse health effects due to its excessive exposure. Our objective was to find out the toxic effects of chromium on tannery workers at Sialkot, Pakistan. A total of 240 males consisting of 120 workers from tanneries at Sialkot and equal number of controls were included. Blood complete counts, high-sensitive C-reactive protein, malondialdehyde and routine biochemical tests were carried out by routine procedures. Chromium levels in blood (BCr) and urine were analyzed using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometer Perkin Elmer analyst-200. Results revealed that all the workers were male with average age of 33 years and 15 (13%) had skin rashes, 14 (12%) had chronic bronchitis, 10 (8%) had gastritis and 4 (3%) conjunctivitis. The tannery workers had significantly raised median (interquartile range) of BCr 569 (377-726) nmol/L as compared to 318 (245-397) nmol/L in the control (p < 0.001). Sixty-five (54%) workers had BCr levels above the upper limit set by Agency for Toxic Substance and Drug Registry. The urinary chromium excretion was significantly high in workers 131 (46-312) nmol/L as compared to 13 (3-26) nmol/L in controls (p < 0.01). The workers had hematological, hepatic and renal function impairment because of oxidative stress on body systems. It is concluded that about half of the workers had excessive exposure to chromium in the tanneries at Sialkot. They had significantly raised chromium levels in their biological fluids and adverse health effects due to enhanced oxidative stress and inflammatory changes.
11330337	Differential inhibition of [3H]-oxotremorine-M and [3H]-quinuclinidyl benzilate binding to muscarinic receptors in rat brain membranes with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.	"The potential interaction of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with cholinergic receptors may play a significant role in the therapeutic and/or side-effects associated with this class of compound. In the present study, the capacity of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors to interact with muscarinic receptors was assessed by their ability to displace both [3H]-oxotremorine-M and [3H]-quinuclinidyl benzilate binding in rat brain membranes. The [3H]-quinuclinidyl benzilate/[3H]-oxotremorine-M affinity ratios permitted predictions to be made of either the antagonist or agonist properties of the different compounds. A series of compounds, representative of the principal classes of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, displaced [3H]-oxotremorine-M binding with high-to-moderate potency (ambenonium>neostigmine=pyridostigmine=tacrine>physostigmine> edrophonium=galanthamine>desoxypeganine) whereas only ambenonium and tacrine displaced [3H]-quinuclinidyl benzilate binding. Inhibitors such as desoxypeganine, parathion and gramine demonstrated negligible inhibition of the binding of both radioligands. Scatchard plots constructed from the inhibition of [3H]-oxotremorine-M binding in the absence and presence of different inhibitors showed an unaltered Bmax and a reduced affinity constant, indicative of potential competitive or allosteric mechanisms. The capacity of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, with the exception of tacrine and ambenonium, to displace bound [3H]-oxotremorine-M in preference to [3H]quinuclinidyl benzilate predicts that the former compounds could act as potential agonists at muscarinic receptors. Moreover, the rank order for potency in inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (ambenonium>neostigmine=physostigmine =tacrine>pyridostigmine=edrophonium=galanthamine >desoxypeganine>parathion>gramine) indicated that the most effective inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase also displaced [3H]-oxotremorine-M to the greatest extent. The capacity of these inhibitors to displace [3H]-oxotremorine-M binding preclude their utilisation for the prevention of acetylcholine catabolism in rat brain membranes, the latter being required to estimate the binding of acetylcholine to [3H]-oxotremorine-M-labelled muscarinic receptors. However, fasciculin-2, a potent peptide inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (IC50 24 nM), did prevent catabolism of acetylcholine in rat brain membranes with an atypical inhibition isotherm of [3H]-oxotremorine-M binding, thus permitting an estimation of the ""global affinity"" of acetylcholine (Ki 85 nM) for [3H]-oxotremorine-M-labelled muscarinic receptors in rat brain."
10878295	The use of leflunomide in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis: an experimental and clinical review.	Leflunomide, the newest disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), acts by inhibiting dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the pathway for pyrimidine production. The drug thus limits T-cell proliferation, a process thought to be a key step in the pathogenesis of RA. In placebo-controlled trials, leflunomide was superior to placebo and comparable to sulfasalazine and methotrexate for improving the signs and symptoms of RA; and superior to placebo, sulfasalazine, and methotrexate for improving health-related quality of life. In the same trials, leflunomide was also superior to methotrexate and comparable to sulfasalazine for slowing radiographically assessed progression of RA. When used in combination therapy in an open-label trial, leflunomide resulted in improvement for over half of a group of RA patients who had failed to respond to methotrexate alone. The most common adverse events associated with leflunomide treatment were gastrointestinal symptoms, allergic reactions, alopecia, and elevated liver enzyme levels. Adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity and resolved without sequelae. Clinical trial results indicate that leflunomide is an efficacious and safe addition to the roster of therapeutic agents used to treat RA.
19683471	Cellular mechanisms of insulin resistance: role of stress-regulated serine kinases and insulin receptor substrates (IRS) serine phosphorylation.	Insulin receptor substrates (IRS) serine phosphorylation is a time-controlled physiological feedback mechanism in insulin signaling that is hijacked by metabolic and inflammatory stresses to promote insulin resistance. Kinases, including IKKbeta, JNK, ERK, mTOR, and S6K, activated by the inducers of insulin resistance induce uncontrolled IRS serine phosphorylation. Studies with genetically modified mice reveal that these kinases integrate signals from metabolic and inflammatory stresses in adipose tissue, liver, and hypothalamus leading to peripheral and central insulin resistance. Moreover, IKKbeta/NF-kappaB and JNK1 pathways in myeloid cells represent a core mechanism involved in inflammation linked to obesity. These kinases are thus potential drug targets against insulin resistance and the targeting of the IKKbeta/NF-kappaB or the JNK pathway may evolve into future diabetes medication.
23085436	Chemical cholecystokinin receptor activation protects against obesity-diabetes in high fat fed mice and has sustainable beneficial effects in genetic ob/ob mice.	The current study has determined the ability of (pGlu-Gln)-CCK-8 to counter the development of diet-induced obesity-diabetes and examined persistence of beneficial metabolic effects in high fat and ob/ob mice, respectively. Twice daily injection of (pGlu-Gln)-CCK-8 in normal mice transferred to a high fat diet reduced energy intake (p < 0.001), body weight (p < 0.01), circulating insulin and LDL-cholesterol (p < 0.001) and improved insulin sensitivity (p < 0.001) as well as oral and intraperitoneal (p < 0.001) glucose tolerance. Energy intake, body weight, circulating insulin and glucose tolerance of (pGlu-Gln)-CCK-8 mice were similar to lean controls. In addition, (pGlu-Gln)-CCK-8 prevented the effect of high fat feeding on triacylglycerol accumulation in liver and muscle. Interestingly, (pGlu-Gln)-CCK-8 significantly (p < 0.001) elevated pancreatic glucagon content. Histological examination of the pancreata of (pGlu-Gln)-CCK-8 mice revealed no changes in islet number or size, but there was increased turnover of beta-cells with significantly (p < 0.001) increased numbers of peripherally located alpha-cells, co-expressing both glucagon and GLP-1. Beneficial metabolic effects were observed similarly in ob/ob mice treated twice daily with (pGlu-Gln)-CCK-8 for 18 days, including significantly reduced energy intake (p < 0.05), body weight (p < 0.05 to p < 0.01), circulating glucose (p < 0.05 to p < 0.01) and insulin (p < 0.05 to p < 0.001) and improved glucose tolerance (p < 0.05) and insulin sensitivity (p < 0.001). Notably, these beneficial effects were still evident 18 days following cessation of treatment. These studies emphasize the potential of (pGlu-Gln)-CCK-8 for the treatment of obesity-diabetes.
23287539	Differential anti-ischemic efficacy and therapeutic time window of trans- and cis-hinokiresinols: Stereo-specific antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities.	During cerebral ischemia, neurons are injured by various mechanisms including excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses. Thus, pharmacological manipulation of multiple cytotoxic pathways has been pursued for the treatment of ischemic injury. Cis-hinokiresinol, a naturally occurring phenylpropanoid, was previously reported to possess anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and estrogen-like activities. In the present study, we investigated anti-ischemic effects of trans- and cis-hinokiresinols using in vitro as well as in vivo experimental models. The ORAC and DPPH assays showed that two isomers had similar free radical scavenging activities. However, only trans-hinokiresinol significantly decreased neuronal injury in cultured cortical neurons exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (75 min) followed by re-oxygenation (9 h). The differential neuroprotective effect could be due to the stereo-specific augmentation of Cu/Zn-SOD activity by trans-hinokiresinol, when compared with cis-hinokiresinol. Similarly, in rats subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (1.5 h) followed by 24-h reperfusion, pre-ischemic treatment with trans-hinokiresinol, but not with cis-isomer, reduced cerebral infarct volume. Interestingly, however, post-ischemic treatment with both hinokiresinols (2 and 7 h after onset of ischemia) significantly reduced cerebral infarct. When administered after onset of ischemia, trans-hinokiresinol, but not its cis-isomer reduced nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity in ischemic regions. In contrast, both hinokiresinols suppressed neutrophil infiltration and IL-1β release to a similar extent. The observed differential anti-oxidant, but comparable anti-inflammatory, activities may explain the stereo-specific anti-ischemic activities and different therapeutic time windows of the hinokiresinols examined. More detailed delineation of the anti-ischemic mechanism(s) of hinokiresinols may provide a better strategy for development of efficacious regimens for cerebral ischemic stroke.
23524313	Hypocholesterolemic effect of daily fisetin supplementation in high fat fed Sprague-Dawley rats.	We aimed to test whether fisetin could modulate cholesterol homeostasis in rats with diet-induced hypercholesterolemia, and further investigated the underlying mechanisms by which fisetin exerts its cholesterol lowering effect. Blood lipid profile, hepatic cholesterol content, as well as gene expressions in cholesterol metabolism were examined. Elevated levels of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, along with hepatic cholesterol content in a high fat group were found to be significantly reduced by fisetin. The high fat diet significantly decreased hepatic mRNA levels of LDLR, SREBP2, HMGCR and PCSK9 in comparison to the control diet, however, fisetin did not further elicit any changes in mRNA levels of the same genes. The high fat diet dramatically increased the transcript levels of CYP7A1, which was subsequently reversed by the fisetin. In HepG2 cells, fisetin was found to increase the levels of a nuclear form of SREBP2 and LDLR. In conclusion, fisetin supplementation displayed hypocholesterolemic effects by modulating the expression of genes associated with cholesterol and bile acid metabolism.
10082498	Angiotensin II receptor blockade in normotensive subjects: A direct comparison of three AT1 receptor antagonists.	Use of angiotensin (Ang) II AT1 receptor antagonists for treatment of hypertension is rapidly increasing, yet direct comparisons of the relative efficacy of antagonists to block the renin-angiotensin system in humans are lacking. In this study, the Ang II receptor blockade induced by the recommended starting dose of 3 antagonists was evaluated in normotensive subjects in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, 4-way crossover study. At 1-week intervals, 12 subjects received a single dose of losartan (50 mg), valsartan (80 mg), irbesartan (150 mg), or placebo. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system was assessed before and 4, 24, and 30 hours after drug intake by 3 independent methods: inhibition of the blood pressure response to exogenous Ang II, in vitro Ang II receptor assay, and reactive changes in plasma Ang II levels. At 4 hours, losartan blocked 43% of the Ang II-induced systolic blood pressure increase; valsartan, 51%; and irbesartan, 88% (P<0.01 between drugs). The effect of each drug declined with time. At 24 hours, a residual effect was found with all 3 drugs, but at 30 hours, only irbesartan induced a marked, significant blockade versus placebo. Similar results were obtained when Ang II receptor blockade was assessed with an in vitro receptor assay and by the reactive rise in plasma Ang II levels. This study thus demonstrates that the first administration of the recommended starting dose of irbesartan induces a greater and longer lasting Ang II receptor blockade than that of valsartan and losartan in normotensive subjects.
23527529	The pre-clinical absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion properties of IPI-926, an orally bioavailable antagonist of the hedgehog signal transduction pathway.	Abstract 1. IPI-926 is a novel semisynthetic cyclopamine derivative that is a potent and selective Smoothened inhibitor that blocks the hedgehog signal transduction pathway. 2. The in vivo clearance of IPI-926 is low in mouse and dog and moderate in monkey. The volume of distribution is high across species. Oral bioavailability ranges from moderate in monkey to high in mouse and dog. Predicted human clearance using simple allometry is low (24 L h(-1)), predicted volume of distribution is high (469 L) and predicted half-life is long (20 h). 3. IPI-926 is highly bound to plasma proteins and has minimal interaction with human α-1-acid glycoprotein. 4. In vitro metabolic stability ranges from stable to moderately stable. Twelve oxidative metabolites were detected in mouse, rat, dog, monkey and human liver microsome incubations and none were unique to human. 5. IPI-926 is not a potent reversible inhibitor of CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9 or 3A4 (testosterone). IPI-926 is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C19, 2D6 and 3A4 (midazolam) with KI values of 19, 16 and 4.5 µM, respectively. IPI-926 is both a substrate and inhibitor (IC50 = 1.9 µM) of P-glycoprotein. 6. In summary, IPI-926 has desirable pre-clinical absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion properties.
23315277	Silica nanoparticles-induced cytotoxicity, oxidative stress and apoptosis in cultured A431 and A549 cells.	In medicine, the use of silica nanoparticles (SiO(2) NPs) offers new perspectives in biosensor, drug delivery and cancer therapy. However, questions about potential toxic and deleterious effects of SiO(2) NPs have also been raised. The aim of this study was to investigate the induction of cytotoxicity, oxidative stress and apoptosis by SiO(2) NPs (size 15 nm) in human skin epithelial (A431) and human lung epithelial (A549) cells. SiO(2) NPs (concentration range 25-200 µg/ml) induced dose-dependent cytotoxicity in both types of cells, which was demonstrated by cell viability (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide) and lactate dehydrogenase leakage assays. SiO(2) NPs were also found to induce oxidative stress in a dose-dependent manner, indicated by depletion of glutathione and induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and lipid peroxidation. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that following the exposure of cells to SiO(2) NPs, the messenger RNA level of apoptotic genes (caspase-3 and caspase-9) were upregulated in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, activities of caspase-3 and caspase-9 enzymes were also significantly higher in both kinds of cells exposed to SiO(2) NPs. This study suggested that SiO(2) NPs induce cytotoxicity and apoptosis in A431 and A549 cells, which is likely to be mediated through ROS generation and oxidative stress.
23322164	Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 and carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase are involved in the mitochondrial synthesis and export of acylcarnitines.	Acylcarnitines are commonly used in the diagnosis of mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation disorders (mFAODs). It is generally assumed that this plasma acylcarnitine profile reflects the mitochondrial accumulation of acyl-CoAs. The identity of the enzymes and the mitochondrial and plasmalemmal transporters involved in the synthesis and export of these metabolites have remained undefined. We used lentiviral shRNA to knock down the expression of medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) in control and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2)-, carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase (CACT)-, and plasmalemmal carnitine transporter (OCTN2)-deficient human fibroblasts. These cell lines, including mock-transduced controls, were loaded with decanoic acid and carnitine, followed by the measurement of the acylcarnitine profile in the extracellular medium. In control fibroblasts, MCAD knockdown markedly increased the production of octanoylcarnitine (3-fold, P<0.01). OCTN2-deficient cell lines also showed extracellular accumulation of octanoylcarnitine (2.8-fold, P<0.01), suggesting that the cellular export of acylcarnitines does not depend on OCTN2. In contrast, in CPT2- and CACT-deficient cells, the accumulation of octanoylcarnitine in the medium did not significantly increase in the MCAD knockdown. Similar results were obtained using pharmacological inhibition of CPT2 in fibroblasts from MCAD-deficient individuals. This shows that CPT2 and CACT are crucial for mitochondrial acylcarnitine formation and export to the extracellular fluids in mFAOD.-Violante, S., IJlst, L., te Brinke, H., Tavares de Almeida, I., Wanders, R. J. A., Ventura, F. V., Houten, S. M. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 and carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase are involved in the mitochondrial synthesis and export of acylcarnitines.
23643746	Enhanced excitability in the infralimbic cortex produces anxiety-like behaviors.	The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been implicated in modulating anxiety. However, it is unknown whether excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmission in the infralimbic (IL) subregion of the mPFC underlies the pathology of anxiety-related behavior. To address this issue, we infused the GABAA receptor (GABAAR) antagonist bicuculline to temporarily activate the IL cortex. IL cortex activation decreased the time spent in the center area in the open field test, decreased exploration of the open-arms in the elevated plus maze test, and increased the latency to bite food in the novelty-suppressed feeding test. These findings substantiate the GABAergic system's role in anxiety-related behaviors. IL cortex inactivation with the AMPA receptor (AMPAR) antagonist CNQX produced opposite, anxiolytic effects. However, infusion of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonist AP5 into the IL cortex had no significant effect. Additionally, we did not observe motor activity deficits or appetite deficits following inhibition of GABAergic or glutamatergic neurotransmission. Interestingly, we found parallel and corresponding electrophysiological changes in anxious mice; compared to mice with relatively low anxiety, the relatively high anxiety mice exhibited smaller evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs) and larger AMPA-mediated evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs) in pyramidal neurons in the IL cortex. The changes of eIPSCs and eEPSCs were due to presynaptic mechanisms. Our results suggest that imbalances of neurotransmission in the IL cortex may cause a net increase in excitatory inputs onto pyramidal neurons, which may underlie the pathogenic mechanism of anxiety disorders.
16495926	A selective retinoid X receptor agonist bexarotene (LGD1069, targretin) inhibits angiogenesis and metastasis in solid tumours.	The present study determined the influence of a retinoid X receptor agonist bexarotene on angiogenesis and metastasis in solid tumours. In the experimental lung metastasis xenograft models, treatment with bexarotene inhibited the development of the lung tumour nodule formation compared to control. In vivo angiogenesis assay utilising gelfoam sponges, bexarotene reduced angiogenesis in sponges containing vascular endothelial growth factor, epidermal growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor to various extent. To determine the basis of these observations, human breast and non-small-cell lung cancer cells were subjected to migration and invasion assays in the presence of bexarotene. Our data showed that bexarotene decrease migration and invasiveness of tumour cells in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, bexarotene inhibited angiogenesis by directly inhibiting human umbilical vein endothelial cell growth and indirectly inhibiting tumour cell-mediated migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells through Matrigel matrix. Analysis of tumour-conditioned medium indicated that bexarotene decreased the secretion of angiogenic factors and matrix metalloproteinases and increased the tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases. The ability of bexarotene to inhibit angiogenesis and metastasis was dependent on activation of its heterodimerisation partner peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma. Collectively, our results suggest a role of bexarotene in treatment of angiogenesis and metastasis in solid tumours.
23066988	Metformin directly inhibits ghrelin secretion through AMP-activated protein kinase in rat primary gastric cells.	The antidiabetic drug Metformin causes weight loss in both diabetic and non-diabetic individuals. Metformin treatment is also associated with lower circulating levels of the orexigenic hormone ghrelin. To test whether Metformin directly affects ghrelin cells, rat primary stomach cells were treated with Metformin and the levels of ghrelin secretion, proghrelin gene expression and activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) were examined. Metformin significantly reduced ghrelin secretion and proghrelin mRNA production and both these effects were blocked by co-incubation with the AMPK inhibitor compound C. Furthermore, the AMPK activator 5-amino-1-β-D-ribofuranosyl-imidazole-4-carboxamide (AICAR) significantly inhibited ghrelin secretion. Additionally, ghrelin cells were shown to express AMPK. Finally, Metformin treatment caused a significant increase in the level of phosphorylated (active) AMPK. Our results show that Metformin directly inhibits stomach ghrelin production and secretion through AMPK. This reduction in ghrelin secretion may be one of the key components in Metformin's mechanism of weight loss.
23256725	The effects of kisspeptin in human reproductive function - therapeutic implications.	Kisspeptin is a 54-amino acid peptide which is encoded by the KiSS-1 gene and activates the G protein-coupled receptor GPR54. Evidence suggests that this system is a key regulator of mammalian and human reproduction. Animal studies have shown that GPR54-deficient mice have abnormal sexual development. Central and peripheral administration of kisspeptin stimulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis whilst pre-administration of a gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist abolishes this effect. In humans, inactivating GPR54 mutations cause normosmic hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism whilst activation of GPR54 signalling is associated with premature puberty. In healthy human volunteers, the acute intravenous administration of kisspeptin potently increases plasma luteinising hormone (LH) levels and significantly increases plasma follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and testosterone without side effects in both males and in females particularly in the preovulatatory phase of the menstrual cycle. In infertility due to hypothalamic amenorrhoea acute administration of kisspeptin results in stimulation of reproductive hormones. The kisspeptin/GPR54 system therefore appears to play an important role in the regulation of reproduction in humans. Hence kisspeptin has potential as a novel tool for the manipulation of the HPG axis and treatment of infertility in humans. This review discusses the evidence highlighting kisspeptin's key role in human reproduction.
22798249	Correlation of high urinary Smad1 level with glomerular hyperfiltration in type 2 diabetes mellitus.	The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between urinary Smad1 and glomerular hyperfiltration (GHF) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and to explore the factors related to the urinary Smad1 in T2DM. The reference value of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was determined in 248 healthy individuals. 30 patients with GHF, 58 patients with norm-GFR T2DM, and 24 healthy patients who served as controls were recruited. Urinary Smad1, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting serum C-Peptide (C-P), hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c), cystatin C, and other chemistry laboratory parameters of T2DM participants and controls were measured. Patients with GHF had higher levels of urinary Smad1 than the control group, and those with norm-GFR. For T2DM patients with body mass index, age, and gender adjustments, urinary Smad1 was positively correlated with FPG, HbA1C, and eGFR, but negatively correlated with fasting serum C-P. Multivariate linear regression analysis demonstrated that eGFR, HbA1C, and fasting serum C-P were independently associated with urinary Smad1. High levels of urinary Smad1 were found in GHF patients with T2DM, which may be another potential mechanism of GHF in relation to diabetic nephropathy.
23589329	Arsenic inhibits autophagic flux activating the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway in a p62-dependent manner.	The Nrf2-Keap1 signaling pathway is a protective mechanism promoting cell survival. Activation of the Nrf2 pathway by natural compounds has been proven to be an effective strategy for chemoprevention. Interestingly, a cancer-promoting function of Nrf2 has been recently observed in many types of tumors due to deregulation of the Nrf2-Keap1 axis, which leads to constitutive activation of Nrf2. Here, we report a novel mechanism of Nrf2 activation by arsenic that is distinct from that of chemopreventive compounds. Arsenic deregulates the autophagic pathway through blockage of autophagic flux, resulting in accumulation of autophagosomes and sequestration of p62, Keap1, and LC3. Thus, arsenic activates Nrf2 through a non-canonical mechanism (p62-dependent), leading to a chronic, sustained activation of Nrf2. In contrast, activation of Nrf2 by sulforaphane and tert-butylhydroquinone depend upon Keap1-C151 and not p62 (the canonical mechanism). More importantly, SF and tBHQ do not have any effect on autophagy. In fact, SF and tBHQ alleviate arsenic-mediated deregulation of autophagy. Collectively, these findings provide evidence that arsenic causes prolonged activation of Nrf2 through autophagy dysfunction, possibly providing a similar scenario to constitutive activation of Nrf2 found in certain human cancers. This may represent a previously unrecognized mechanism underlying arsenic toxicity and carcinogenicity in humans.
23605695	Pasireotide: A Review of Its Use in Cushing's Disease.	Pasireotide (Signifor(®)) is a new subcutaneous somatostatin analogue that acts via somatostatin receptors to inhibit the secretion of corticotropin from the pituitary adenoma in patients with Cushing's disease. Pasireotide has a receptor binding profile that is distinct from that of other somatostatin analogues, binding with high affinity to somatostatin receptor subtype 5, which is strongly over expressed in corticotroph adenoma cells. Pasireotide is the first pituitary-directed agent to be approved for use in Cushing's disease. In a phase III clinical trial in patients with Cushing's disease, twice-daily pasireotide 600 or 900 μg for 6 months led to normalization of urinary free cortisol (UFC) levels in up to a quarter of all patients (primary endpoint) and significantly reduced mean UFC levels. The reduction in UFC levels is rapid (within one to two months) and sustained (up to 24 months). Most patients who do not have an early response to pasireotide do not respond at a later time point. Decreases in UFC levels achieved during pasireotide treatment are accompanied by decreases in serum and salivary cortisol levels, as well as improvements in clinical signs and symptoms, including body weight, blood pressure and health-related quality-of-life. Pasireotide has a generally similar tolerability profile to that of other somatostatin analogues, but is associated with a relatively high incidence of hyperglycaemia, requiring the addition or intensification of glucose-lowering medication in a substantial proportion of patients. Thus, pasireotide, together with on-going patient monitoring, provides a promising new option for the medical management of Cushing's disease.
17526944	In vivo inhibition of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein expression by dexamethasone parallels induction of the negative transcription factor DAX-1.	In this study, we investigated the effect of dexamethasone on the synthesis of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and the expression of DAX-1 (dosage sensitive sex reversal adrenal hypoplasia congenita critical region on the X chromosome, gene 1) and SF-1 (steroidogenic factor-1) in vivo. Male rats were treated with dexamethasone (0.4 and 4 mg/kg body wt per day) by intraperitoneal injections using phosphate-buffered saline as the vehicle for 7 d. At the end of 7 d, serum testosterone levels were decreased. Response to luteinizing hormone (LH) and 8-bromo-cyclic-AMP (8-Br-cAMP) in vitro was reduced in testicular cells isolated from dexamethasone-treated rat testes. Dexamethasone decreased LH-stimulated cAMP production. The conversion of 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, pregnenolone, 17-hydroxypregnenolone, dehydroepiandrosterone, and androstenedione to testosterone was not affected by dexamethasone. Dexamethasone increased DAX-1 expression and concordantly decreased StAR protein and mRNA in testicular cells. The increase in DAX-1 protein corresponded to a 57% reduction in StAR mRNA levels concomitant with a 79% reduction in serum testosterone levels. Dexamethasone had no effect on the level of SF-1, but increased the amount of complexed DAX-1-SF-1. Dexamethasone in vitro suppressed StAR promoter activity when an increasing amount of DAX-1 cDNA was transfected. These results demonstrate that dexamethasone increases expression of DAX-1, which results in increased amounts of complexed DAX-1-SF-1, in the absence of any change in the expression of SF-1. These observations strongly support the concept that dexamethasone suppresses rat testicular testosterone production, at least in part, by increasing the amount of complexed DAX-1-SF-1 in these cells, which leads directly to decreased availability of free SF-1 and, therefore, decreased activation of transcription of the rat StAR gene.
23548896	Identification of a new interaction mode between the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) and Csk-binding protein (Cbp)/phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid microdomains (PAG).	Proteins with Src homology 2 (SH2) domains play major roles in tyrosine kinase signaling. Structures of many SH2 domains have been studied, and the regions involved in their interactions with ligands have been elucidated. However, these analyses have been performed using short peptides comprising phosphotyrosine followed by a few amino acids, which are described as the canonical recognition sites. Here we report the solution structure of the SH2 domain of C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) in complex with a longer phosphopeptide from Csk-binding protein (Cbp). This structure, together with biochemical experiments, revealed the existence of a novel binding region in addition to the canonical phosphotyrosine-314 binding site of Cbp. Mutational analysis of this second region in cells showed that both canonical and novel binding sites are required for tumor suppression through the Cbp-Csk interaction. Furthermore, the data indicate an allosteric connection between Cbp binding and Csk activation that arises from residues in the βB/βC loop of the SH2 domain.
23295227	X-ray structure of the V301L aldo-keto reductase 1B10 complexed with NADP(+) and the potent aldose reductase inhibitor fidarestat: implications for inhibitor binding and selectivity.	Only one crystal structure is currently available for tumor marker AKR1B10, complexed with NADP(+) and tolrestat, which is an aldose reductase inhibitor (ARI) of the carboxylic acid type. Here, the X-ray structure of the complex of the V301L substituted AKR1B10 holoenzyme with fidarestat, an ARI of the cyclic imide type, was obtained at 1.60Å resolution by replacement soaking of crystals containing tolrestat. Previously, fidarestat was found to be safe in phase III trials for diabetic neuropathy and, consistent with its low in vivo side effects, was highly selective for aldose reductase (AR or AKR1B1) versus aldehyde reductase (AKR1A1). Now, inhibition studies showed that fidarestat was indeed 1300-fold more selective for AR as compared to AKR1B10, while the change of Val to Leu (found in AR) caused a 20-fold decrease in the IC50 value with fidarestat. Structural analysis of the V301L AKR1B10-fidarestat complex displayed enzyme-inhibitor interactions similar to those of the AR-fidarestat complex. However, a close inspection of both the new crystal structure and a computer model of the wild-type AKR1B10 complex with fidarestat revealed subtle changes that could affect fidarestat binding. In the crystal structure, a significant motion of loop A was observed between AR and V301L AKR1B10, linked to a Phe-122/Phe-123 side chain displacement. This was due to the presence of the more voluminous Gln-303 side chain (Ser-302 in AR) and of a water molecule buried in a subpocket located at the base of flexible loop A. In the wild-type AKR1B10 model, a short contact was predicted between the Val-301 side chain and fidarestat, but would not be present in AR or in V301L AKR1B10. Overall, these changes could contribute to the difference in inhibitory potency of fidarestat between AR and AKR1B10.
17112803	High-dose methotrexate in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia: impact of ABCC2 polymorphisms on plasma concentrations.	OBJECTIVE: The adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) class transporter ABCC2 (MRP2 [multidrug resistance related protein 2] or cMOAT [canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter]) is involved in the cellular outward transport and elimination of methotrexate. We hypothesized that common genetic variations may contribute to the variability of high-dose methotrexate pharmacokinetics. METHODS: Polymorphisms in all 32 exons of the ABCC2 gene were analyzed in a reference group of 59 healthy white subjects by polymerase chain reaction, single-strand conformation polymorphism, and sequencing. Subsequently, we assessed the association of polymorphisms with the methotrexate plasma concentrations in 44 pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (29 male and 15 female patients; mean age, 6.8+/-4.8 years). Patients received 4 cycles of 5000 mg/m2 body surface area according to the ALL-Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster (BFM) 95 or ALL-BFM 2000 protocol. RESULTS: In the reference group we detected 8 frequent single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Five of these were in complete linkage disequilibrium. Overall, 5 new polymorphisms are described. The genotype distribution of the patient cohort was not significantly different from the reference collective. The mean plasma methotrexate area under the curve from 36 to 48 hours after the start of the infusion was significantly 2-fold higher in female patients carrying at least 1 -24T allele as compared with all other patients (14.2+/-12.8 h.micromol/L versus 6.9+/-4.2 h.micromol/L, P<.001). The risk to have 2 or more cycles necessitating an intensification of folinate rescue was 9-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.8- to 44-fold) in female patients carrying at least 1 T allele (P=.0067). CONCLUSION: The data suggest a hitherto unknown gender-specific impact of the -24C>T ABCC2 gene polymorphism on high-dose methotrexate pharmacokinetics. Whereas a nonfunctional MRP2 variant has been described in a patient with severe impairment of methotrexate excretion, our study is the first to suggest that a frequent ABCC2 polymorphism contributes to variability of methotrexate kinetics.
23334864	Iron overload inhibits osteoblast biological activity through oxidative stress.	Iron overload has recently been connected with bone mineral density in osteoporosis. However, to date, the effect of iron overload on osteoblasts remains poorly understood. The purpose of this study is to examine osteoblast biological activity under iron overload. The osteoblast cells (hFOB1.19) were cultured in a medium supplemented with different concentrations (50, 100, and 200 μM) of ferric ammonium citrate as a donor of ferric ion. Intracellular iron was measured with a confocal laser scanning microscope. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected by 2,7-dichlorofluorescin diacetate fluorophotometry. Osteoblast biological activities were evaluated by measuring the activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and mineralization function. Results indicated that iron overload could consequently increase intracellular iron concentration and intracellular ROS levels in a concentration-dependent manner. Additionally, ALP activity was suppressed, and a decline in the number of mineralized nodules was observed in in vitro cultured osteoblast cells. According to these results, it seems that iron overload probably inhibits osteoblast function through higher oxidative stress following increased intracellular iron concentrations.
15917650	Inhibition of c-fms by imatinib: expanding the spectrum of treatment.	Imatinib is a selective protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor currently used in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). It specifically suppresses the growth of bcr-abl expressing CML progenitor cells by blocking the ATP-binding site of the kinase domain of bcr-abl. Imatinib also inhibits the c-abl, platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), abl-related gene and stem cell factor receptor, c-kit, protein tyrosine kinases. It is through inhibition of c-kit that imatinib is also used clinically in the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumours. We have recently demonstrated that imatinib also specifically targets the macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor, c-fms, at therapeutic concentrations. Although this finding has important implications with regard to potential side effects in patients currently receiving imatinib therapy, these results suggest that imatinib may also be useful in the treatment of diseases where c-fms is implicated. This includes breast and ovarian cancer and inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. We also speculate that imatinib may be used in diseases where bone destruction occurs due to excessive osteoclast activity, such as in the haematologic malignancy, multiple myeloma.
15899831	AZD2171: a highly potent, orally bioavailable, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor for the treatment of cancer.	Inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF) signaling is a promising therapeutic approach that aims to stabilize the progression of solid malignancies by abrogating tumor-induced angiogenesis. This may be accomplished by inhibiting the kinase activity of VEGF receptor-2 (KDR), which has a key role in mediating VEGF-induced responses. The novel indole-ether quinazoline AZD2171 is a highly potent (IC50 < 1 nmol/L) ATP-competitive inhibitor of recombinant KDR tyrosine kinase in vitro. Concordant with this activity, in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, AZD2171 inhibited VEGF-stimulated proliferation and KDR phosphorylation with IC50 values of 0.4 and 0.5 nmol/L, respectively. In a fibroblast/endothelial cell coculture model of vessel sprouting, AZD2171 also reduced vessel area, length, and branching at subnanomolar concentrations. Once-daily oral administration of AZD2171 ablated experimental (VEGF-induced) angiogenesis in vivo and inhibited endochondral ossification in bone or corpora luteal development in ovary; physiologic processes that are highly dependent upon neovascularization. The growth of established human tumor xenografts (colon, lung, prostate, breast, and ovary) in athymic mice was inhibited dose-dependently by AZD2171, with chronic administration of 1.5 mg per kg per day producing statistically significant inhibition in all models. A histologic analysis of Calu-6 lung tumors treated with AZD2171 revealed a reduction in microvessel density within 52 hours that became progressively greater with the duration of treatment. These changes are indicative of vascular regression within tumors. Collectively, the data obtained with AZD2171 are consistent with potent inhibition of VEGF signaling, angiogenesis, neovascular survival, and tumor growth. AZD2171 is being developed clinically as a once-daily oral therapy for the treatment of cancer.
15277241	Mice deficient in glutathione transferase zeta/maleylacetoacetate isomerase exhibit a range of pathological changes and elevated expression of alpha, mu, and pi class glutathione transferases.	Glutathione transferase zeta (GSTZ1-1) is the major enzyme that catalyzes the metabolism of alpha-halo acids such as dichloroacetic acid, a carcinogenic contaminant of chlorinated water. GSTZ1-1 is identical with maleylacetoacetate isomerase, which catalyzes the penultimate step in the catabolic pathways for phenylalanine and tyrosine. In this study we have deleted the Gstz1 gene in BALB/c mice and characterized their phenotype. Gstz1(-/-) mice do not have demonstrable activity with maleylacetone and alpha-halo acid substrates, and other GSTs do not compensate for the loss of this enzyme. When fed a standard diet, the GSTZ1-1-deficient mice showed enlarged liver and kidneys as well as splenic atrophy. Light and electron microscopic examination revealed multifocal hepatitis and ultrastructural changes in the kidney. The addition of 3% (w/v) phenylalanine to the drinking water was lethal for young mice (<28 days old) and caused liver necrosis, macrovesicular steatosis, splenic atrophy, and a significant loss of circulating leukocytes in older surviving mice. GSTZ1-1-deficient mice showed constitutive induction of alpha, mu, and pi class GSTs as well as NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1. The overall response is consistent with the chronic accumulation of a toxic metabolite(s). We detected the accumulation of succinylacetone in the serum of deficient mice but cannot exclude the possibility that maleylacetoacetate and maleylacetone may also accumulate.
10839333	A positron emission tomography study of quetiapine in schizophrenia: a preliminary finding of an antipsychotic effect with only transiently high dopamine D2 receptor occupancy.	BACKGROUND: Quetiapine is a new atypical antipsychotic medication. As such, relatively little has been published regarding its in vivo effects at the dopamine type 2 (D2) and serotonin type 2a (5-HT2a) receptor systems. The following study was undertaken to explore these effects across the clinical dose range and relate this information to its clinical profile. METHODS: Twelve patients with schizophrenia were randomly assigned to doses of 150 to 600 mg/d (n=3, at 150, 300, 450, and 600 mg/d) of quetiapine. After 3 weeks of treatment, D2 and 5-HT2a occupancy were measured using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, 12 to 14 hours after the last dose. Clinical efficacy and adverse effect ratings were obtained at baseline, at the time of PET scanning, and at 12 weeks. Two additional patients were included to examine the effects of the drug 2 to 3 hours after last dose. RESULTS: Quetiapine was an effective antipsychotic and improved the extrapyramidal symptoms and prolactin level elevation noted at baseline. It achieved these results with minimal (0%-27%) D2 occupancy 12 hours after the last dose. Study of the additional subjects revealed that quetiapine does give rise to transiently high (58%-64%) D2 occupancy 2 to 3 hours after a single dose that then decreases to minimal levels in 12 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Quetiapine shows a transiently high D2 occupancy, which decreases to very low levels by the end of the dosing interval. Quetiapine's low D2 occupancy can explain its freedom from extrapyramidal symptoms and prolactin level elevation. The data suggest that transient D2 occupancy may be sufficient for its antipsychotic effect. Future studies controlling for nonpharmacological effects as well as activities on other receptors will be necessary to confirm this suggestion.
23093023	Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 and protein kinase Cδ contribute to endothelin-1 constriction and elevated blood pressure in intermittent hypoxia.	Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with cardiovascular complications including hypertension. Previous findings from our laboratory indicate that exposure to intermittent hypoxia (IH), to mimic sleep apnea, increases blood pressure in rats. IH also increases endothelin-1 (ET-1) constrictor sensitivity in a protein kinase C (PKC) δ-dependent manner in mesenteric arteries. Because phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1) regulates PKCδ activity, we hypothesized that PDK-1 contributes to the augmented ET-1 constrictor sensitivity and elevated blood pressure following IH. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to either sham or IH (cycles between 21% O(2)/0% CO(2) and 5% O(2)/5% CO(2)) conditions for 7 h/day for 14 or 21 days. The contribution of PKCδ and PDK-1 to ET-1-mediated vasoconstriction was assessed in mesenteric arteries using pharmacological inhibitors. Constrictor sensitivity to ET-1 was enhanced in arteries from IH-exposed rats. Inhibition of PKCδ or PDK-1 blunted ET-1 constriction in arteries from IH but not sham group rats. Western analysis revealed similar levels of total and phosphorylated PDK-1 in arteries from sham and IH group rats but decreased protein-protein interaction between PKCδ and PDK-1 in arteries from IH- compared with sham-exposed rats. Blood pressure was increased in rats exposed to IH, and treatment with the PDK-1 inhibitor OSU-03012 [2-amino-N-{4-[5-(2-phenanthrenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl]-phenyl}-acetamide] (33 mg/day) lowered blood pressure in IH but not sham group rats. Our results suggest that exposure to IH unmasks a role for PDK-1 in regulating ET-1 constrictor sensitivity and blood pressure that is not present under normal conditions. These novel findings suggest that PDK-1 may be a uniquely effective antihypertensive therapy for OSA patients.
20407761	Zolmitriptan and human aggression: interaction with alcohol.	RATIONALE: The serotonin 1(B/D) (5-HT1(B/D)) receptor has shown potential as a target for decreasing aggression. The 5-HT1(B/D) agonist zolmitriptan's ability to reduce aggressive behavior in humans and its interaction with the well-known aggression-enhancing drug alcohol were examined. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to investigate zolmitriptan's potential to modify human aggression in a laboratory paradigm across a range of alcohol doses. Alcohol has been consistently associated with aggression and violence, thus we hoped to expand current understanding of alcohol's role in aggressive behavior via manipulation of the serotonin (5-HT) system. METHODS: Eleven social drinkers, seven male, were recruited to participate in a research study lasting 3-4 weeks. Aggression was measured using the point-subtraction aggression paradigm (PSAP), a laboratory model widely used in human aggression studies. Subjects were administered 5-mg zolmitriptan and placebo capsules along with alcohol doses of 0.0, 0.4 and 0.8 g/kg in a within-subject, counterbalanced dosing design. Data were analyzed as the ratio of aggressive/monetary-earning responses, to account for possible changes in overall motor function due to alcohol. RESULTS: There was a significant alcohol by zolmitriptan interaction on the aggressive/monetary response ratio. Specifically, compared to placebo, zolmitriptan decreased the aggressive/monetary ratio at the 0.4- and 0.8-g/kg alcohol doses. CONCLUSIONS: A 5-mg dose of zolmitriptan effectively reduced alcohol-related aggression in an acute dosing protocol, demonstrating an interaction of 5-HT and alcohol in human aggressive behavior.
23209192	Cotinine in human placenta predicts induction of gene expression in fetal tissues.	Maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality. However, the mechanisms underlying adverse birth outcomes following prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke remain unknown due, in part, to the absence or unreliability of information regarding maternal cigarette smoke exposure during pregnancy. Our goal was to determine if placental cotinine could be a reliable biomarker of fetal cigarette smoke exposure during pregnancy. Cotinine levels were determined in placentas from 47 women who reported smoking during pregnancy and from 10 women who denied cigarette smoke exposure. Cotinine levels were significantly higher in placentas from women reporting cigarette smoking (median = 27.2 ng/g) versus women who reported no smoke exposure (2.3 ng/g, P < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified an optimal cut point of 7.5 ng/g (sensitivity = 78.7%, specificity = 100%) to classify placenta samples from mothers who smoked versus those from mothers who did not. Among 415 placentas for which maternal cigarette smoking status was unavailable, 167 had cotinine levels > 7.5 ng/g and would be considered positive for cigarette smoke exposure. Data from quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses demonstrated that in utero cigarette smoke exposure predicted by cotinine in placenta is associated with changes in the expression of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes in fetal tissues. CYP1A1 mRNA in fetal lung and liver tissue and CYP1B1 mRNA in fetal lung tissue were significantly induced when cotinine was detected in placenta. These findings indicate that cotinine in placenta is a reliable biomarker for fetal exposure and response to maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy.
23187687	Effects of bidentate coordination on the molecular properties rapta-C based complex using theoretical approach.	In this work several quantum properties including the NEDA and QTAIM are computed on three models of rapta-C complexes using DFT with hybrid functional and basis set with ECP and without ECP. Several interesting correlations within the observed properties and also with the reported experimental behaviors of these complexes including their biological activities are presented. The study shows that the stability of the two complexes with bidentate ligands is associated with their high hydrogen bonding stability and existence of stronger non-covalent metal-ligand bonds. The energy decomposition analysis indicated that inter-atomic interactions in the three forms of rapta-C complexes and their stability are governed by the charge transfer term with significant contributions from polarization and electrostatic terms. The higher stability of complex 1 and 2 over 3 comes from the lower exchange repulsion and higher polarization contributions to their stability which agrees perfectly with the experimental observation. Our results provide insight into the nature of intramolecular forces that influence the structural stability of the three complexes.
23161217	Suramin decreases injury and improves regeneration of ethanol-induced steatotic partial liver grafts.	Steatotic grafts are excluded for use in partial liver transplantation (LT) because of the increased risk of primary nonfunction. This study investigated the effects of suramin, a polysulfonated naphthylurea, on the outcome of steatotic partial LT. Rat livers were harvested after acute ethanol treatment (6 g/kg, intragastric administration), reduced in size to ≈ 1/3, and transplanted. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and total bilirubin levels as well as hepatic necrosis and apoptosis were significantly higher after transplantation of fatty partial grafts (FPG) than lean partial grafts (LPG). Suramin (5 mg/kg, i.p.) decreased ALT by ≈ 60%, hyperbilirubinemia by 75%, necrosis by 83%, and apoptosis by 70% after FPG transplantation. Hepatic cellular 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation increased to 28% in LPG but was only 2% in FPG at 48 hours, and the mitotic index increased to 7% in LPG but was only 0.2% in FPG, indicating suppressed regeneration in FPG. Suramin increased BrdU incorporation and the mitotic index to 43% and 9%, respectively, in FPG. All FPG recipients died within 5 days. Suramin recovered survival of FPG to 62%. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) mRNA was 2.2-fold higher in FPG than in LPG and was associated with activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 in FPG. Suramin decreased TNF-α and caspase activation in FPG. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), phospho-Smad2/3 and p21Cip1 were significantly higher in FPG than in LPG and suramin blocked TGF-β formation and its down-stream signaling pathway. Taken together, suramin improves the outcome of FPG transplantation, most likely by inhibition of TNF-α and TGF-β formation.
7526860	Keratinocyte growth factor and acidic fibroblast growth factor are mitogens for primary cultures of mammary epithelium.	Mammary epithelial cells derived from the entire mammary parenchyma or only end buds were isolated by collagenase digestion of mammary glands from virgin mice. Cells were cultured within collagen gels in serum-free medium containing insulin. Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF or FGF-7) and acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF or FGF-1) stimulated multifold proliferation when added alone to this medium. Growth occurred as three-dimensional colonies within the collagen gel matrix. KGF stimulated growth was unaffected by adding heparin. Conversely, multifold growth stimulation by acidic FGF required heparin. Since end buds are the actively proliferating cell population of ductal glands, organ cultures of these structures were prepared. KGF stimulated 3H-thymidine incorporation in these end buds in the absence and presence of epidermal growth factor. These data suggest that acidic FGF and KGF may represent in vivo stromal factors capable of regulating mammary gland development.
21631396	Pseudoephedrine inhibits T-cell activation by targeting NF-kappaB, NFAT and AP-1 signaling pathways.	Pseudoephedrine (PSE) is a stereoisomer of ephedrine that is commonly used as a nasal decongestant in combination with other anti-inflammatory drugs for the symptomatic treatment of some common pathologies such as common cold. Herein, we describe for the first time the effects of PSE on T-cell activation events. We found that PSE inhibits interleukin-2 (IL-2) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha-gene transcription in stimulated Jurkat cells, a human T-cell leukemia cell line. To further characterize the inhibitory mechanisms of PSE at the transcriptional level, we examined the transcriptional activities of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), and activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factors and found that PSE inhibited NF-kappaB-dependent transcriptional activity without affecting either the phosphorylation, the degradation of the cytoplasmic NF-kappaB inhibitory protein, IkappaBalpha or the DNA-binding activity. However, phosphorylation of the p65/RelA subunit was clearly inhibited by PSE in stimulated cells. In addition, PSE inhibited the transcriptional activity of NFAT without interfering with the calcium-induced NFAT dephosphorylation event, which represents the major signaling pathway for its activation. NFAT cooperates with c-Jun, a compound of the AP-1 complex, to activate target genes, and we also found that PSE inhibited both JNK activation and AP-1 transcriptional activity. These findings provide new mechanistic insights into the potential immunomodulatory activities of PSE and highlight their potential in designing novel therapeutic strategies to manage inflammatory diseases.
10826417	Neostigmine: safe and effective treatment for acute colonic pseudo-obstruction.	BACKGROUND: Ogilvie's syndrome, or acute colonic pseudo-obstruction, is a common and relatively dangerous condition. If left untreated, it may cause ischemic necrosis and colonic perforation, with a mortality rate as high as 50 percent. Neostigmine enhances excitatory parasympathetic activity by competing with acetylcholine for attachment to acetylcholinesterase at sites of cholinergic transmission and enhancing cholinergic action. We hypothesized that neostigmine would restore peristalsis in patients with acute colonic pseudo-obstruction. METHODS: Twenty-eight patients at Fletcher Allen Health Care and The Cleveland Clinic Foundation were treated for acute colonic pseudo-obstruction with neostigmine 2.5 mg IV over 3 minutes while being monitored with telemetry. Mechanical obstruction had been excluded. RESULTS: Complete clinical resolution of large bowel distention occurred in 26 of the 28 patients. Time to pass flatus varied from 30 seconds to 10 minutes after administration of neostigmine. No adverse effects or complications were noted. Of the two patients who did not resolve, one had a sigmoid cancer that required resection and one patient died from multiorgan failure. CONCLUSION: This study supports the theory that acute colonic pseudo-obstruction is the result of excessive parasympathetic suppression rather than sympathetic overactivity. We have shown that neostigmine is a safe and effective treatment for acute colonic pseudo-obstruction.
25598831	Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors: a growing class of antidiabetic agents.	Although several treatment options are available to reduce hyperglycemia, only about half of individuals with diagnosed diabetes mellitus (DM) achieve recommended glycemic targets. New agents that reduce blood glucose concentrations by novel mechanisms and have acceptable safety profiles are needed to improve glycemic control and reduce the complications associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The renal sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) is responsible for reabsorption of most of the glucose filtered by the kidney. Inhibitors of SGLT2 lower blood glucose independent of the secretion and action of insulin by inhibiting renal reabsorption of glucose, thereby promoting the increased urinary excretion of excess glucose. Canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin are SGLT2 inhibitors approved as treatments for T2DM in the United States, Europe, and other countries. Canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin increase renal excretion of glucose and improve glycemic parameters in patients with T2DM when used as monotherapy or in combination with other antihyperglycemic agents. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors is associated with weight reduction, lowered blood pressure, and a low intrinsic propensity to cause hypoglycemia. Overall, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin are well tolerated. Cases of genital infections and, in some studies, urinary tract infections have been more frequent in canagliflozin-, dapagliflozin-, and empagliflozin-treated patients compared with those receiving placebo. Evidence from clinical trials suggests that SGLT2 inhibitors are a promising new treatment option for T2DM.
23386703	Investigating the enteroenteric recirculation of apixaban, a factor Xa inhibitor: administration of activated charcoal to bile duct-cannulated rats and dogs receiving an intravenous dose and use of drug transporter knockout rats.	The study described here investigated the impact of intestinal excretion (IE; excretion of drug directly from circulation to intestinal lumen), enteroenteric recirculation (EER), and renal tubule recirculation (RTR) on apixaban pharmacokinetics and disposition. The experimental approaches involve integrating apixaban elimination pathways with pharmacokinetic profiles obtained from bile duct-cannulated (BDC) rats and dogs receiving i.v. doses together with oral administration of activated charcoal (AC). Additionally, the role of P-gp (P-glycoprotein; abcb1) and BCRP (breast cancer resistance protein; abcg2) in apixaban disposition was evaluated in experiments using transporter inhibitors and transporter knockout (KO) rats. Approximately 20-50% of an apixaban i.v. dose was found in feces of BDC rats and dogs, suggesting IE leading to fecal elimination and intestinal clearance (IC). The fecal elimination, IC, and systemic clearance of apixaban were increased upon AC administration in both BDC rats and dogs and were decreased in BDC rats dosed with GF-120918, a dual BCRP and P-gp inhibitor). BCRP appeared to play a more important role for absorption and intestinal and renal elimination of apixaban than P-gp in transporter-KO rats after oral and i.v. dosing, which led to a higher level of active renal excretion in rat than other species. These data demonstrate that apixaban undergoes IE, EER, and RTR that are facilitated by efflux transporters. Intestinal reabsorption of apixaban could be interrupted by AC even at 3 hours post-drug dose in dogs (late charcoal effect). This study demonstrates that the intestine is an organ for direct clearance and redistribution of apixaban. The IE, EER, and RTR contribute to overall pharmacokinetic profiles of apixaban. IE as a clearance pathway, balanced with metabolism and renal excretion, helps decrease the impacts of intrinsic (renal or hepatic impairment) and extrinsic (drug-drug interactions) factors on apixaban disposition.
18794803	CRAF inhibition induces apoptosis in melanoma cells with non-V600E BRAF mutations.	Here, we identify a panel of melanoma lines with non-V600E mutations in BRAF. These G469E- and D594G-mutated melanomas were found to exhibit constitutive levels of phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) and low levels of phospho-mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (pMEK) and were resistant to MEK inhibition. Upon treatment with the CRAF inhibitor sorafenib, these lines underwent apoptosis and associated with mitochondrial depolarization and relocalization of apoptosis-inducing factor, whereas the BRAF-V600E-mutated melanomas did not. Studies have shown low-activity mutants of BRAF (G469E/D594G) instead signal through CRAF. Unlike BRAF, CRAF directly regulates apoptosis through mitochondrial localization where it binds to Bcl-2 and phosphorylates BAD. The CRAF inhibitor sorafenib was found to induce a time-dependent reduction in both BAD phosphorylation and Bcl-2 expression in the D594G/G469E lines only. Knockdown of CRAF using a lentiviral shRNA suppressed both Bcl-2 expression and induced apoptosis in the D594G melanoma line but not in a V600E-mutated line. Finally, we showed in a series of xenograft studies that sorafenib was more potent at reducing the growth of tumors with the D594G mutation than those with the V600E mutation. In summary, we have identified a group of melanomas with low-activity BRAF mutations that are reliant upon CRAF-mediated survival activity.
10611634	Agonist and antagonist actions of yohimbine as compared to fluparoxan at alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors (AR)s, serotonin (5-HT)(1A), 5-HT(1B), 5-HT(1D) and dopamine D(2) and D(3) receptors. Significance for the modulation of frontocortical monoaminergic transmission and depressive states.	Herein, we evaluate the interaction of the alpha(2)-AR antagonist, yohimbine, as compared to fluparoxan, at multiple monoaminergic receptors and examine their roles in the modulation of adrenergic, dopaminergic and serotonergic transmission in freely-moving rats. Yohimbine displays marked affinity at human (h)alpha(2A)-, halpha(2B)- and halpha(2C)-ARs, significant affinity for h5-HT(1A), h5-HT(1B), h5-HT(1D), and hD(2) receptors and weak affinity for hD(3) receptors. In [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding protocols, yohimbine exerts antagonist actions at halpha(2A)-AR, h5-HT(1B), h5-HT(1D), and hD(2) sites, yet partial agonist actions at h5-HT(1A) sites. In vivo, agonist actions of yohimbine at 5-HT(1A) sites are revealed by WAY100,635-reversible induction of hypothermia in the rat. In guinea pigs, antagonist actions of yohimbine at 5-HT(1B) receptors are revealed by blockade of hypothermia evoked by the 5-HT(1B) agonist, GR46,611. In distinction to yohimbine, fluparoxan shows only modest partial agonist actions at h5-HT(1A) sites versus marked antagonist actions at halpha(2)-ARs. While fluparoxan selectively enhances hippocampal noradrenaline (NAD) turnover, yohimbine also enhances striatal dopamine (DA) turnover and suppresses striatal turnover of 5-HT. Further, yohimbine decreases firing of serotonergic neurones in raphe nuclei, an action reversed by WAY100,635. Fluparoxan increases extracellular levels of DA and NAD, but not 5-HT, in frontal cortex. In analogy, yohimbine enhances FCX levels of DA and NAD, yet suppresses those of 5-HT, the latter effect being antagonized by WAY100,635. The induction by fluoxetine of FCX levels of 5-HT, DA, and NAD is potentiated by fluparoxan. Yohimbine likewise facilitates the influence of fluoxetine upon DA and NAD levels, but not those of 5-HT. In conclusion, the alpha(2)-AR antagonist properties of yohimbine increase DA and NAD levels both alone and in association with fluoxetine. However, in contrast to the selective alpha(2)-AR antagonist, fluparoxan, the 5-HT(1A) agonist actions of yohimbine suppress 5-HT levels alone and underlie its inability to augment the influence of fluoxetine upon 5-HT levels.
17413599	Lubiprostone: a chloride channel activator.	In January 2006 the Food and Drug Administration approved lubiprostone for the treatment of chronic constipation in men and women aged 18 and over. Lubiprostone is categorized as a prostone, a bicyclic fatty acid metabolite of prostaglandin E1. Lubiprostone activates a specific chloride channel (ClC-2) in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to enhance intestinal fluid secretion, which increases GI transit and improves symptoms of constipation. This article reviews the role of chloride channels in the GI tract, describes the structure, function, and pharmacokinetics of lubiprostone, and discusses clinically important data on this new medication.
10439935	Entacapone. A review of its use in Parkinson's disease.	UNLABELLED: Entacapone is a potent and specific peripheral catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor. It has been shown to improve the clinical benefits of levodopa plus an aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor (AADC) when given to patients with Parkinson's disease and end-of-dose deterioration in the response to levodopa (the 'wearing off' phenomenon). The efficacy of entacapone is currently being assessed in patients with stable Parkinson's disease. In 2 well conducted trials of 6 months' duration and smaller short term studies, treatment with entacapone (200 mg with each dose of levodopa/AADC inhibitor) was associated with significant increases in daily 'on' time and decreases in 'off' time. Changes in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores concurred with changes in 'on' and 'off' times: entacapone improved total, activities of daily living and motor function scores, but it had no effect on mentation scores. Entacapone also provided benefits when given with controlled release levodopa/ AADC inhibitor or with standard levodopa/AADC inhibitor and selegiline in small trials. Dopaminergic events, including dyskinesia and nausea, are among the most common events with entacapone, and are related to the drug's ability to potentiate the effects of levodopa. Diarrhoea, abdominal pain, constipation and urine discolouration are the most common nondopaminergic events, although the latter event is the only one to occur consistently more frequently with entacapone than with placebo. However, adverse events of any type infrequently led to study discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy and tolerability of entacapone administered with levodopa/AADC inhibitor have not yet been compared with those of other strategies for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, once the decision to initiate levodopa therapy has been made, studies generally support the use of entacapone as an adjunct to levodopa in patients with Parkinson's disease and the 'wearing off' phenomenon.
15680478	Leptin fragments induce Fos immunoreactivity in rat hypothalamus.	Leptin presents an important role in energy balance and neuroendocrine control in mammals. In an attempt to identify regions of the leptin molecule responsible for its bioactivity, we have synthesized six peptides based on the protein three-dimensional structure. Fragments were synthesized by the solid-phase methodology, purified by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), and characterized by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS). They were injected intravenously and their ability to induce Fos immunoreactivity (Fos-ir) in rat hypothalamus was compared with that of the recombinant human leptin and saline. Fragment Ac-[Ser117]Lep116-140-NH2 (V) induced Fos-ir in hypothalamic nuclei that express leptin receptor long form. No similar ability was observed for the other five fragments. To investigate whether Fos-ir was induced in the same neuronal group activated by leptin, we proceeded with a dual-label immunohistochemistry for cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), a neuropeptide related to leptin action in rat hypothalamus. We found that Ac-[Ser117]Lep116-140-NH2 (V) differentially activates CART neurons through the rostrocaudal extension of the arcuate nucleus. These results suggest that this fragment acts in the same group of neurons that mediate leptin response. This approach may offer the basis for the development of leptin-related compounds, having potential application in human or veterinary medicine.
11916794	Tramadol inhibits norepinephrine transporter function at desipramine-binding sites in cultured bovine adrenal medullary cells.	UNLABELLED: Tramadol is a widely used analgesic, but its mode of action is not well understood. To study the effects of tramadol on norepinephrine transporter (NET) function, we assayed the effect of tramadol on [3H]-norepinephrine ([3H]-NE) uptake and [3H]-desipramine binding to plasma membranes isolated from bovine adrenal medulla. We then characterized [14C]-tramadol binding in cultured bovine adrenal medullary cells. Tramadol inhibited the desipramine-sensitive uptake of [3H]-NE by the cells in a concentration-dependent manner (50% inhibitory concentration = 21.5 +/- 6.0 microM). Saturation analysis revealed that tramadol increased the apparent Michaelis constant of [3H]-NE uptake without changing the maximal velocity, indicating that inhibition occurred via competition for the NET (inhibition constant, K(i) = 13.7 microM). Tramadol inhibited the specific binding of [3H]-desipramine to plasma membranes. Scatchard analysis of [3H]-desipramine binding revealed that tramadol increased the apparent dissociation constant (K(d)) for binding without altering maximal binding, indicating competitive inhibition (K(i) = 11.2 microM). The binding of [14C]-tramadol to the cells was specific and saturable, with a K(d) of 18.1 +/- 2.4 microM. These findings indicate that tramadol competitively inhibits NET function at desipramine-binding sites. IMPLICATIONS: Tramadol competitively inhibits norepinephrine transporter function at desipramine-binding sites in the adrenal medullary cells and probably the noradrenergic neurons of the descending inhibitory system.
23315644	Characterization of four new mouse cytochrome P450 enzymes of the CYP2J subfamily.	The cytochrome P450 superfamily encompasses a diverse group of enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of various substrates. The mouse CYP2J subfamily includes members that have wide tissue distribution and are active in the metabolism of arachidonic acid (AA), linoleic acid (LA), and other lipids and xenobiotics. The mouse Cyp2j locus contains seven genes and three pseudogenes located in a contiguous 0.62 megabase cluster on chromosome 4. We describe four new mouse CYP2J isoforms (designated CYP2J8, CYP2J11, CYP2J12, and CYP2J13). The four cDNAs contain open reading frames that encode polypeptides with 62-84% identity with the three previously identified mouse CYP2Js. All four new CYP2J proteins were expressed in Sf21 insect cells. Each recombinant protein metabolized AA and LA to epoxides and hydroxy derivatives. Specific antibodies, mRNA probes, and polymerase chain reaction primer sets were developed for each mouse CYP2J to examine their tissue distribution. CYP2J8 transcripts were found in the kidney, liver, and brain, and protein expression was confirmed in the kidney and brain (neuropil). CYP2J11 transcripts were most abundant in the kidney and heart, with protein detected primarily in the kidney (proximal convoluted tubules), liver, and heart (cardiomyocytes). CYP2J12 transcripts were prominently present in the brain, and CYP2J13 transcripts were detected in multiple tissues, with the highest expression in the kidney. CYP2J12 and CYP2J13 protein expression could not be determined because the antibodies developed were not immunospecific. We conclude that the four new CYP2J isoforms might be involved in the metabolism of AA and LA to bioactive lipids in mouse hepatic and extrahepatic tissues.
23458730	Concentration-dependent inhibitory effects of baicalin on the metabolism of dextromethorphan, a dual probe of CYP2D and CYP3A, in rats.	Baicalin has been shown to possess many pharmacological effects, including antiviral, antioxidant, anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties. In the current study, we reveal the inhibitory effects of baicalin on the metabolism of dextromethorphan (DXM), a dual probe substrate of CYP2D and CYP3A, in rats. Lineweaver-Burk plots demonstrated that baicalin inhibited the activities of CYP2D and CYP3A in a non-competitive manner in rat liver microsomes (RLMs). Concomitant administration of baicalin (0.90g/kg, i.v.) and DXM (10mg/kg, i.v.) increased the maximum drug concentration (Cmax) (37%) and the area under concentration-time curve (AUC) (42%) and decreased the clearance (CL) (27%) of DXM in a randomised, crossover study in rats (P<0.01). The change in the AUC of DXM was significantly correlated with the Cmax and AUC of baicalin (P<0.05). The inhibitory effects of multiple doses of baicalin (0.90g/kg, i.v., 12days) on the metabolism of DXM were similar to those observed following a single dose in rats. The activity of CYP3A in excised liver samples from rats following multiple baicalin treatment was significantly decreased compared to that of the control group (P<0.05), whereas multiple doses of baicalin had no obvious effect on the activity of CYP2D. Taken together, these data demonstrate that baicalin inhibits the metabolism of DXM in a concentration-dependent manner in rats, possibly through inhibiting hepatic CYP2D and CYP3A activities.
23131177	Characterization of substituted phenylpropylamides as highly selective agonists at the melatonin MT2 receptor.	Melatonin is a widely distributed hormone that regulates several major physiological processes, including the circadian rhythm and seasonal adaptation. The two subtypes of mammalian G protein-coupled melatonin receptors are primarily responsible for mediating the actions of melatonin. Because synthetic melatonin agonists have considerable therapeutic potentials in modulating insomnia and circadian- related sleep disorders, it is highly desirable to develop subtype-selective melatoninergic compounds. The pharmacological potencies of a series of substituted N-[3-(3-methoxyphenyl)propyl] amides towards human melatonin MT(1) and MT(2) receptors were evaluated by the FLIPR high-throughput screening assay, whilst their subtype-selectivity was subsequently verified with ERK phosphorylation and cAMP assays. Structure-activity relationship analysis of highly potent subtype-selective ligands (MT(2) EC(50) 10-90 pM) revealed that a benzyloxyl substituent incorporated at C6 position of the 3-methoxyphenyl ring dramatically enhanced the MT(2) potency and at the same time decreased MT(1) potency. Incorporation of structural moieties conferring the subtype selectivity produced several extremely potent MT(2)-selective ligands. The most potent subtype-selective ligand, 2q had a substantially higher potency for MT(2) receptor than melatonin for elevation of [Ca(2+)]i and inhibition of forskolin-elevated cAMP. Representative MT(2)-selective ligands also induced ERK phosphorylation in both recombinant and native cell lines, and no cross-reactivity to 17 other GPCRs could be detected. These ligands represent invaluable tools for delineating the functional roles of distinct melatonin receptor subtypes and are viable candidates for drug development.
15880143	Effect of serum withdrawal on the contribution of L-type calcium channels (CaV1.2) to intracellular Ca2+ responses and chemotaxis in cultured human vascular smooth muscle cells.	Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) chemotaxis is fundamental to atherosclerosis and intimal hyperplasia. An increase in intracellular Ca2+ [Ca2+]i is an important signal in chemotaxis, but the role of L-type calcium channels (CaV1.2) in this response in human vascular smooth muscle cells (hVSMC) has not been examined. hVSMC were grown from explant cultures of saphenous vein. Confluent hVSMC at passage 3 were studied after culture in medium containing 15% foetal calf serum (FCS) (randomly cycling) or following serum deprivation for up to 7 days. Smooth muscle alpha-actin was measured by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. [Ca2+]i was measured using fura 2 fluorimetry. Chemotaxis was measured using a modified Boyden chamber technique and cell attachment to gelatin-coated plates was also quantified. The number and affinity of dihydropyridine-binding sites was assessed using [5-methyl-3H]PN 200-110 binding. In randomly cycling cells, the calcium channel agonist, Bay K 8644a and 100 mM KCl did not affect [Ca2+]i. In addition, the rise in [Ca2+]i induced by platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF) was unaffected by the CaV1.2 antagonists, amlodipine and verapamil. In randomly cycling cells amlodipine did not affect PDGF-induced migration. In serum-deprived cells, smooth muscle alpha-actin was increased and Bay K 8644a and 100 mM KCl increased [Ca2+]i. PDGF-induced rises in [Ca2+]i were also inhibited by amlodipine and verapamil. The ability of Bay K 8644a to increase [Ca2+]i and verapamil to inhibit PDGF-induced rises in [Ca2+]i was evident within 3 days after serum withdrawal. In serum-deprived hVSMC Bay K 8644a induced chemotaxis and amlodipine inhibited PDGF-induced migration. Cell attachment in the presence of PDGF was unaffected by amlodipine in either randomly cycling or serum-deprived hVSMC. Serum withdrawal was associated with a decrease in the maximum number of dihydropyridine-binding sites (B(max)) and a decrease in affinity (K(D)). Serum deprivation of hVSMC results in increased expression of smooth muscle alpha-actin, a marker of more differentiated status, and increased [Ca2+]i responses and chemotaxis mediated by CaV1.2. These observations may have important implications for understanding the therapeutic benefits of calcium channel antagonists in cardiovascular disease.
12668276	Thyroid hormone receptors/THR genes in human cancer.	Thyroid hormone (triiodothyronine, T3) is a pleiotropic regulator of growth, differentiation and tissue homeostasis in higher organisms that acts through the control of target gene expression. Most, if not all, major T3 actions are mediated by specific high affinity nuclear receptors (TR) which are encoded by two genes, THRA and THRB. Several TRalpha and TRbeta receptor isoforms are expressed. Abundant and contradictory literature exists on the relationship between circulating thyroid hormone levels, thyroid diseases and human cancer. In 1986, a connection between TR and cancer became evident when the chicken TRalpha1 was characterized as the c-erbA proto-oncogene, the cellular counterpart of the retroviral v-erbA oncogene. V-erbA causes erythroleukemias and sarcomas in birds, and hepatocellular carcinomas in transgenic mice. In recent years, many studies have analyzed the presence of quantitative (abnormal levels) or qualitative (mutations) alterations in the expression of THR genes in different types of human neoplasias. While their role in tumor generation or progression is currently unclear, both gross chromosomal and minor mutations (deletions, aberrant splicing, point mutations) and changes in the level of expression of THRA and THRB genes have been found. Together with other in vitro data indicating connections between TR and p53, Rb, cyclin D and other cell cycle regulators and oncogenes, these results suggest that THRA and THRB may be involved in human cancer.
11108662	Role of multidrug-resistance protein 2 in glutathione S-transferase P1-1-mediated resistance to 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide toxicities in HepG2 cells.	Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that the phase III efflux transporter multidrug-resistance protein (MRP)1 can act synergistically with the phase II conjugating glutathione S-transferases (GST) to confer resistance to the toxicities of some electrophilic drugs and carcinogens. To determine whether the distinct efflux transporter MRP2 could also potentiate GST-mediated protection from electrophilic toxins, we examined the effect of regulatable GSTP1-1 expression in MRP2-rich HepG2 cells on 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO)-induced cytotoxicity and genotoxicity (nucleic-acid adduct formation). Expression of GSTP1-1 was associated with a fourfold to tenfold protection from 4NQO-induced cytotoxicity. Inhibition of MRP2-mediated efflux activity by sulfinpyrazone or cyclosporin A completely reversed GSTP1-1-associated resistance-a result indicating that GSTP1-1-mediated cytoprotection is absolutely dependent on MRP2 efflux activity. Moreover, MRP2 efflux activity also augmented GSTP1-1-mediated protection from 4NQO-induced nucleic-acid adduct formation. We conclude that MRP2-mediated efflux of the glutathione conjugate of 4NQO and/or another toxic derivative of 4NQO is required to support GSTP1-1-associated protection from 4NQO toxicities in HepG2 cells.
17065054	Micro-array analysis of resistance for gemcitabine results in increased expression of ribonucleotide reductase subunits.	To study in detail the relation between gene expression and resistance against gemcitabine, a cell line was isolated from a tumor for which gemcitabine resistance was induced in vivo. Similar to the in vivo tumor, resistance in this cell line, C 26-G, was not related to deficiency of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK). Micro-array analysis showed increased expression of ribonucleotide reductase (RR) subunits M1 and M2 as confirmed by real time PCR analysis (28- and 2.7-fold, respectively). In cell culture, moderate cross-resistance (about 2-fold) was observed to 1-ss-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C), 2-chloro-2'deoxyadenosine (CdA), LY231514 (ALIMTA), and cisplatin (CDDP), and pronounced cross-resistance (>23-fold) to 2',2'-difluorodeoxyuridine (dFdU) and 2',2'-difluorodeoxyguanosine (dFdG). Culture in the absence of gemcitabine reduced resistance as well as RRM1 RNA expression, demonstrating a direct relationship of RRM1 RNA expression with acquired resistance to gemcitabine.
23402364	Role of nitric oxide in the chemistry and anticancer activity of etoposide (VP-16,213).	Originally identified as an innate cytotoxin, nitric oxide ((·)NO) formation in tumors can influence chemotherapy and exacerbate cancer progression. Here, we examined the hypothesis that (·)NO generation contributes to cancer cell drug resistance toward the widely used anticancer drug Etoposide (VP-16). The UV-vis spectrum of VP-16 was not changed by exposure of VP-16 to (·)NO in aqueous buffer. In contrast, reddish-orange compound(s) characteristic of o-quinone- and nitroso-VP-16 were readily generated in a hydrophobic medium (chloroform) in an oxygen-dependent manner. Similar products were also formed when the VP-16 radical, generated from VP-16 and horseradish peroxidase/H2O2, was exposed directly to (·)NO in chloroform in the presence of oxygen. Separation and spectral analysis of VP-16 reaction extracts by electron spin resonance and UV-vis indicated the generation of the phenoxy radical and the o-quinone of VP-16, as well as putative nitroxide, iminoxyl, and other nitrogen oxide intermediates. Nitric oxide products of VP-16 displayed significantly diminished topoisomerase II-dependent cleavage of DNA and cytotoxicity to human HL-60 leukemia cells. LPS-mediated induction of nitric oxide synthase in murine macrophages resulted in VP-16 resistance compared to Raw cells. Furthermore, (·)NO products derived from iNOS rapidly reacted with VP-16 leading to decreased DNA damage and cytotoxicity. Together, these observations suggest that the formation of (·)NO in tumors (associated macrophages) can contribute to VP-16 resistance via the detoxification of VP-16.
23411181	In vitro biological activity of essential oils and isolated furanosesquiterpenes from the neglected vegetable Smyrnium olusatrum L. (Apiaceae).	Smyrnium olusatrum, better known as Alexanders or wild celery, is a biennal herb used in cuisine for many centuries by Romans in many dishes, where it has now been replaced by celery. In order to provide additional evidences so that this forgotten vegetable can be reconsidered in the human diet, as well as in pharmaceutics, the essential oils obtained from different parts and its main isolated furanosesquiterpenes were in vitro biologically assayed for antiproliferative activity on human tumor cell lines by MTT assay, for antioxidant potential by DPPH, ABTS and FRAP assays, and for antimicrobial activity by the agar disc diffusion method. The essential oils showed cytotoxic effects on tested human tumor cell lines, related to the furanosesquiterpenoid content; the IC(50) values on colon carcinoma, glioblastoma, and breast adenocarcinoma cells were 8.51, 13.35, and 14.81 μg/ml, respectively. Isofuranodiene and 1β-acetoxyfuranoeudesm-4(15)-ene resulted the most active constituents. The essential oils possessed also radical scavenging activity.
10223931	In vitro activities of the potent, broad-spectrum carbapenem MK-0826 (L-749,345) against broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli clinical isolates.	An important mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics is inactivation by beta-lactam-hydrolyzing enzymes (beta-lactamases). The evolution of the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) is associated with extensive use of beta-lactam antibiotics, particularly cephalosporins, and is a serious threat to therapeutic efficacy. ESBLs and broad-spectrum beta-lactamases (BDSBLs) are plasmid-mediated class A enzymes produced by gram-negative pathogens, principally Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. MK-0826 was highly potent against all ESBL- and BDSBL-producing K. pneumoniae and E. coli clinical isolates tested (MIC range, 0.008 to 0.12 microgram/ml). In E. coli, this activity was associated with high-affinity binding to penicillin-binding proteins 2 and 3. When the inoculum level was increased 10-fold, increasing the amount of beta-lactamase present, the MK-0826 MIC range increased to 0.008 to 1 microgram/ml. By comparison, similar observations were made with meropenem while imipenem MICs were usually less affected. Not surprisingly, MIC increases with noncarbapenem beta-lactams were generally substantially greater, resulting in resistance in many cases. E. coli strains that produce chromosomal (Bush group 1) beta-lactamase served as controls. All three carbapenems were subject to an inoculum effect with the majority of the BDSBL- and ESBL-producers but not the Bush group 1 strains, implying some effect of the plasmid-borne enzymes on potency. Importantly, MK-0826 MICs remained at or below 1 microgram/ml under all test conditions.
23312472	Highly selective 2,4-diaminopyrimidine-5-carboxamide inhibitors of Sky kinase.	We report the SAR around a series of 2,4-diaminopyrimidine-5-carboxamide inhibitors of Sky kinase. 2-Aminophenethyl analogs demonstrate excellent potency but moderate kinase selectivity, while 2-aminobenzyl analogs that fill the Ala571 subpocket exhibit good inhibition activity and excellent kinase selectivity.
10485483	Increased cyclooxygenase-2 expression in human pancreatic carcinomas and cell lines: growth inhibition by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.	Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 mRNA and protein expression were found to be frequently elevated in human pancreatic adenocarcinomas and cell lines derived from such tumors. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated cytoplasmic COX-2 expression in 14 of 21 (67%) pancreatic carcinomas. The level of COX-2 mRNA was found to be elevated in carcinomas, relative to histologically normal pancreas from a healthy individual, as assessed by reverse transcription-PCR. COX-2 protein expression was detected by the Western blot assay in three of five pancreatic carcinoma cell lines (BxPC-3, Capan-1, and MDAPanc-3), whereas COX-1 protein was detected in two of the five cell lines (BxPC-3 and Capan-1). Increased levels of COX-2 mRNA were found in four of five cell lines, and only in PANC-1 cells was the low level of transcript comparable to that in the normal pancreas. The level of COX-2 mRNA was positively correlated with the differentiation status of the tumor of origin for each cell line, COX-2 protein expression was up-regulated by epidermal growth factor when the cells were grown in absence of serum. Finally, two nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, sulindac sulfide and NS398, produced a dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation in all pancreatic cell lines tested. No correlation was found between the level of COX-2 or COX-1 expression and the extent of growth inhibition. Treatment of BxPC-3 cells with sulindac sulfide and NS398 resulted in an induction of COX-2 expression. Our findings indicate that COX-2 up-regulation is a frequent event in pancreatic cancers and suggest that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be useful in the chemoprevention and therapy of pancreatic carcinoma.
23117790	Orexin-A suppresses postischemic glucose intolerance and neuronal damage through hypothalamic brain-derived neurotrophic factor.	Orexin-A (a glucose-sensing neuropeptide in the hypothalamus) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; a member of the neurotrophin family) play roles in many physiologic functions, including regulation of glucose metabolism. We previously showed that the development of postischemic glucose intolerance is one of the triggers of ischemic neuronal damage. The aim of this study was to determine whether there was an interaction between orexin-A and BDNF functions in the hypothalamus after cerebral ischemic stress. Male ddY mice were subjected to 2 hours of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Neuronal damage was estimated by histologic and behavioral analyses. Expression of protein levels was analyzed by Western blot. Small interfering RNA directed BDNF, orexin-A, and SB334867 [N-(2-methyl-6-benzoxazolyl)-N'-1,5-naphthyridin-4-yl urea; a specific orexin-1 receptor antagonist] were administered directly into the hypothalamus. The level of hypothalamic orexin-A, detected by immunohistochemistry, was decreased on day 1 after MCAO. Intrahypothalamic administration of orexin-A (1 or 5 pmol/mouse) significantly and dose-dependently suppressed the development of postischemic glucose intolerance on day 1 and development of neuronal damage on day 3. The MCAO-induced decrease in insulin receptor levels in the liver and skeletal muscle on day 1 was recovered to control levels by orexin-A, and this effect of orexin-A was reversed by the administration of SB334867 as well as by hypothalamic BDNF knockdown. These results suggest that suppression of postischemic glucose intolerance by orexin-A assists in the prevention of cerebral ischemic neuronal damage. In addition, hypothalamic BDNF may play an important role in this effect of orexin-A.
10887187	TWIK-2, an inactivating 2P domain K+ channel.	We cloned human and rat TWIK-2 and expressed this novel 2P domain K(+) channel in transiently transfected COS cells. TWIK-2 is highly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, the vasculature, and the immune system. Rat TWIK-2 currents are about 15 times larger than human TWIK-2 currents, but both exhibit outward rectification in a physiological K(+) gradient and mild inward rectification in symmetrical K(+) conditions. TWIK-2 currents are inactivating at depolarized potentials, and the kinetic of inactivation is highly temperature-sensitive. TWIK-2 shows an extremely low conductance, which prevents the visualization of discrete single channel events. The inactivation and rectification are intrinsic properties of TWIK-2 channels. In a physiological K(+) gradient, TWIK-2 is half inhibited by 0.1 mm Ba(2+), quinine, and quinidine. Finally, cysteine 53 in the M1P1 external loop is required for functional expression of TWIK-2 but is not critical for subunit self-assembly. TWIK-2 is the first reported 2P domain K(+) channel that inactivates. The base-line, transient, and delayed activities of TWIK-2 suggest that this novel 2P domain K(+) channel may play an important functional role in cell electrogenesis.
23609128	Dynamics and structural changes of small water clusters on ionization.	Despite utmost importance in understanding water ionization process, reliable theoretical results of structural changes and molecular dynamics (MD) of water clusters on ionization have hardly been reported yet. Here, we investigate the water cations [(H2 O)n = 2-6 (+) ] with density functional theory (DFT), Möller-Plesset second-order perturbation theory (MP2), and coupled cluster theory with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)]. The complete basis set limits of interaction energies at the CCSD(T) level are reported, and the geometrical structures, electronic properties, and infrared spectra are investigated. The characteristics of structures and spectra of the water cluster cations reflect the formation of the hydronium cation moiety (H3 O(+) ) and the hydroxyl radical. Although most density functionals fail to predict reasonable energetics of the water cations, some functionals are found to be reliable, in reasonable agreement with high-level ab initio results. To understand the ionization process of water clusters, DFT- and MP2-based Born-Oppenheimer MD (BOMD) simulations are performed on ionization. On ionization, the water clusters tend to have an Eigen-like form with the hydronium cation instead of a Zundel-like form, based on reliable BOMD simulations. For the vertically ionized water hexamer, the relatively stable (H2 O)5 (+) (5sL4A) cluster tends to form with a detached water molecule (H2 O). © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
23085295	Molecular analyses of dinosaur osteocytes support the presence of endogenous molecules.	The discovery of soft, transparent microstructures in dinosaur bone consistent in morphology with osteocytes was controversial. We hypothesize that, if original, these microstructures will have molecular features in common with extant osteocytes. We present immunological and mass spectrometry evidence for preservation of proteins comprising extant osteocytes (Actin, Tubulin, PHEX, Histone H4) in osteocytes recovered from two non-avian dinosaurs. Furthermore, antibodies to DNA show localized binding to these microstructures, which also react positively with DNA intercalating stains propidium iodide (PI) and 4',6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI). Each antibody binds dinosaur cells in patterns similar to extant cells. These data are the first to support preservation of multiple proteins and to present multiple lines of evidence for material consistent with DNA in dinosaurs, supporting the hypothesis that these structures were part of the once living animals. We propose mechanisms for preservation of cells and component molecules, and discuss implications for dinosaurian cellular biology.
12538485	In vivo antitumor activity of SU11248, a novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor receptors: determination of a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship.	One challenging aspect in the clinical development of molecularly targeted therapies, which represent a new and promising approach to treating cancers, has been the identification of a biologically active dose rather than a maximum tolerated dose. The goal of the present study was to identify a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship in preclinical models that could be used to help guide selection of a clinical dose. SU11248, a novel small molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor with direct antitumor as well as antiangiogenic activity via targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), KIT, and FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinases, was used as the pharmacological agent in these studies. In mouse xenograft models, SU11248 exhibited broad and potent antitumor activity causing regression, growth arrest, or substantially reduced growth of various established xenografts derived from human or rat tumor cell lines. To predict the target SU11248 exposure required to achieve antitumor activity in mouse xenograft models, we directly measured target phosphorylation in tumor xenografts before and after SU11248 treatment and correlated this with plasma inhibitor levels. In target modulation studies in vivo, SU11248 selectively inhibited Flk-1/KDR (VEGF receptor 2) and PDGF receptor beta phosphorylation (in a time- and dose-dependent manner) when plasma concentrations of inhibitor reached or exceeded 50-100 ng/ml. Similar results were obtained in a functional assay of VEGF-induced vascular permeability in vivo. Constant inhibition of VEGFR2 and PDGF receptor beta phosphorylation was not required for efficacy; at highly efficacious doses, inhibition was sustained for 12 h of a 24-h dosing interval. The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship established for SU11248 in these preclinical studies has aided in the design, selection, and evaluation of dosing regimens being tested in human trials.
17076770	Time-specific effects of perinatal glucocorticoid treatment on anterior pituitary morphology, annexin 1 expression and adrenocorticotrophic hormone secretion in the adult female rat.	Perinatal glucocorticoid (GC) treatment is increasingly associated with long-term disturbances in hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical function. In the male rat, such treatment induces profound molecular, morphological and functional changes in the anterior pituitary gland at adulthood. To determine whether these effects are sex-specific, we have examined the effects of perinatal dexamethasone treatment on the female pituitary gland, focusing on (i) the integrity of the annexin 1 (ANXA1) dependent regulatory effects of GCs on adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) release and (ii) corticotroph and folliculo-stellate (FS) cell morphology. Dexamethasone was given to pregnant (gestational days 16-19) or lactating (days 1-7 post partum) rats via the drinking water (1 microg/ml); controls received normal drinking water. Pituitary tissue from the female offspring was examined ex vivo at adulthood (60-90 days). Both treatment regimes reduced the intracellular and cell surface ANXA1 expression, as determined by western blot analysis and quantitative immunogold electron microscopic histochemistry. In addition, they compromised the ability of dexamethasone to suppress the evoked release of ACTH from the excised tissue in vitro, a process which requires the translocation of ANXA1 from the cytoplasm to the cell surface of FS cells. Although neither treatment regime affected the number of FS cells or corticotrophs, both altered the subcellular morphology of these cells. Thus, prenatal dexamethasone treatment increased while neonatal treatment decreased FS cell size and cytoplasmic area. By contrast, corticotroph size was unaffected by either treatment, as also was the size of the secretory granules. Corticotroph granule density and margination were, however, increased markedly by the prenatal treatment, while the neonatal treatment had no effect on granule density but decreased granule margination. Thus, perinatal dexamethasone treatment exerts long-term effects on the female pituitary gland, altering gene expression, cell morphology and the ANXA1-dependent GC regulation of ACTH secretion. The changes are similar but not identical to those reported in the male.
23147987	Effects-based marine ecological risk assessment at a polychlorinated biphenyl-contaminated site in Saglek, Labrador, Canada.	Although the presence and distribution of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in Arctic marine environments has been well documented, the implications for the health of biota are poorly understood. In the present study, multiple lines of evidence, including site-specific effects data, were used to assess PCB-related risks to marine biota at a contaminated military site in Saglek Bay, Labrador, Canada, from 1997 to 1999. Risks were evaluated for three components of the ecosystem: benthic invertebrates, a bottom-feeding fish (shorthorn sculpin, Myoxocephalus scorpius), and a diving seabird (black guillemot, Cepphus grylle). Average sediment PCB concentrations exceeded the Canadian interim sediment quality guideline level by 41-fold. However, sediment toxicity testing and a benthic community survey showed no evidence of adverse effects. In contrast, shorthorn sculpin and black guillemot PCB exposures (measured as sum of 55 congeners) were elevated enough to pose risks to survival or reproduction. Based on the collective evidence, the authors estimated that risks were posed by sediment PCB concentrations greater than 77 ng/g dry weight for black guillemots and 750 ng/g dry weight for shorthorn sculpins. The present study, along with two parallel studies, provided information to support the management decisions concerning potential remedial action on the contaminated sediments. This ecological risk assessment describes the steps and rationale taken to evaluate the risk posed by an area of PCB-contaminated marine sediments in an otherwise relatively pristine northern coastal environment.
11141093	Hexahydrochromeno[4,3-b]pyrrole derivatives as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.	In a search for less flexible analogues of caproctamine (1), a diamine diamide endowed with an interesting AChE affinity profile, we discovered compound 2, in which the terminal 2-methoxybenzyl groups of 1 have been incorporated into a tricyclic system. Since this compound retains good AChE inhibitory activity and its hexahydrochromeno[4,3-b]pyrrole moiety is reminiscent of the hexahydropyrrolo[2,3-b]indole of physostigmine (3), we have designed and synthesized carbamates 4-6, and their biological evaluation has been assessed in vitro against human AChE and BChE. The 6-carbamate 4 was almost as potent as physostigmine and was 60- and 550-fold more potent than the 7-carbamate 5 and the 8-carbamate 6, respectively. The two enantiomers of 4, (-)-4 and (+)-4, did not show a marked enantioselectivity. Finally, a similar time-dependent pattern of inhibition of AChE was observed for 3 and 4.
23530765	Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Study of Copper Hopping in Doped Bis(l-histidinato)cadmium Dihydrate.	Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was used to study Cu(II) dynamic behavior in a doped biological model crystal, bis(l-histidinato)cadmium dihydrate, in order to gain better insight into copper site stability in metalloproteins. Temperature-dependent changes in the low temperature X-band EPR spectra became visible around 100 K and continued up to room temperature. The measured 298 K g-tensor (principal values: 2.17, 2.16, 2.07) and copper hyperfine coupling tensor (principal values: -260, -190, -37 MHz) were similar to the average of the 77 K tensor values pertaining to two neighboring histidine binding sites. The observed temperature dependence was interpreted using Anderson's theory of motional narrowing, where the magnetic parameters for the different states are averaged as the copper rapidly hops between sites. The EPR pattern was also found to undergo a sharp sigmoidal-shaped, temperature-dependent conversion between two species with a critical temperature Tc ≈ 160 K. The species below Tc hops between the two low temperature site patterns, and the one above Tc represents an average of the molecular spin Hamiltonian coupling tensors of the two 77 K sites. In addition, the low and high temperature species hop between one another, contributing to the dynamic averaging. Spectral simulations using this 4-state model determined a hop rate between the two low temperature sites νh4 = 4.5 × 10(8) s(-1) and between the low and high temperature states νh2 = 1.7 × 10(8) s(-1) at 160 K. An Arrhenius relationship of hop rate and temperature gave energy barriers of ΔE4 = 389 cm(-1) and ΔE2 = 656 cm(-1) between the two low temperature sites and between the low and high temperature states, respectively.
15887238	Induction of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor and activation of EGF receptor in imatinib mesylate-treated squamous carcinoma cells.	Imatinib mesylate is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the ABL, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and c-kit kinases. Inhibition of BCR-ABL and c-kit accounts for its clinical activity in leukemia and sarcoma, respectively. In this report, we describe other cellular targets for imatinib. Treatment of head and neck squamous carcinoma cells with clinically relevant concentrations of imatinib-induced changes in cell morphology and growth similar to changes associated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation. Imatinib-induced changes were blocked with the EGFR antagonist cetuximab, which suggested direct involvement of EGFR in this process. Western blot analysis of cells incubated with imatinib demonstrated activation of EGFR and downstream signaling that was reduced by inhibition of mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1 (MEK1) and EGFR, but not Her2/ErbB2. An in vitro kinase assay showed that imatinib did not directly affect EGFR kinase activity, suggesting involvement of EGFR-activating molecules. Inhibitors and neutralizing antibodies against heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF), and to a lesser extent transforming growth factor-alpha, reduced imatinib-mediated mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. Imatinib stimulated the rapid release of soluble HB-EGF and the subsequent induction of membrane-bound HB-EGF, which correlated with biphasic MAPK activation. Together, these results suggested that imatinib affects EGFR activation and signaling pathways through rapid release and increased expression of endogenous EGFR-activating ligands. Although, imatinib primarily inhibits tyrosine kinases, it also stimulates the activity of EGFR tyrosine kinase in head and neck squamous tumors. This finding demonstrates the need for careful use of this drug in cancer patients.
17023173	Decitabine--bedside to bench.	PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: Epigenetic changes marked by DNA methylation are known to contribute to the malignant transformation of cells by silencing critical genes. Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferase and has shown therapeutic effects in patients with hematologic malignancies. However, the connection between the clinical activity of decitabine and its demethylating activity is not clear. Herein, we summarize the results of recent clinical trials of decitabine in hematologic malignancies, and review the translational research into decitabine's mechanism of clinical activity. RECENT FINDINGS: Low-dose decitabine has been studied recently in multiple clinical trials and has been shown to be effective for treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes. Correlative laboratory studies of clinical trials have shown that decitabine induces global hypomethylation as well as hypomethylation of gene-specific promoters and activation of gene expression. Past a given threshold, induction of higher degrees of hypomethylation is not directly associated with a better clinical outcome. Moreover, studies have suggested that patients with promoter hypermethylation of p15(INK4B) at baseline have paradoxically a lower chance of achieving response than those without hypermethylation. Furthermore, several other genes activated by decitabine were independent of hypomethylation in the promoter regions. CONCLUSION: While at least part of decitabine's activity is through induction of hypomethylation and reactivation of critical genes, mechanisms independent from hypomethylation are also important for decitabine's antitumor activity.
17034586	Interferon-gamma is causatively involved in experimental inflammatory bowel disease in mice.	Cytokines may be crucially involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), but it remains controversial whether interferon (IFN)-gamma, a typical proinflammatory cytokine, is an essential mediator to cause the disorders. In the present study, IFN-gamma(-/-) and wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice were fed 2.5% dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) in drinking water for 7 days, in order to investigate DSS-induced intestinal inflammation. The DSS-treated WT mice exhibited a robust production of IFN-gamma in the gut, a remarkable loss of body weight, as well as high rate of mortality (60%). In striking contrast, IFN-gamma deficient mice did not develop DSS-induced colitis, as indicated by the maintenance of body weight and survival rate of 100%. Severe intestinal inflammation was demonstrated exclusively in WT animals in terms of the shortening of the bowel as well as the elevation of the disease activity index, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and serum haptoglobin level. Histological study of DSS-treated WT intestine revealed disruption of mucosal epithelium and massive infiltration of inflammatory cells, while the organ from IFN-gamma(-/-) mice remained virtually normal in appearance. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analyses indicated abundant production of three chemokines, i.e. monokine induced by interferon-gamma (MIG), interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), in the DSS-irritated intestine of WT but not of IFN-gamma(-/-) mice. The present results demonstrate clearly that IFN-gamma plays indispensable roles in the initiation of DSS colitis, and some chemokines are produced in an IFN-gamma-dependent fashion.
23064031	Inhibition of EGF/EGFR activation with naphtho[1,2-b]furan-4,5-dione blocks migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells.	Naphtho[1,2-b]furan-4,5-dione (NFD), a bioactive component of Avicennia marina, has been demonstrated to display anti-cancer activity. Activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-induced signaling pathway has been correlated with cancer metastasis in various tumors, including breast carcinoma. We use EGF as a metastatic inducer of MDA-MB-231 cells to investigate the effect of NFD on cell migration and invasion. NFD suppressed EGF-mediated protein levels of c-Jun and c-Fos, and reduced MMP-9 expression and activity, concomitantly with a marked inhibition on cell migration and invasion without obvious cellular cytotoxicity. NFD abrogated EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGF receptor (EGFR) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt. The specific PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, blocked significantly EGF-induced cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 inhibited EGF-induced MMP-9 expression, cell migration and invasion, as well as the activation of PI3K/Akt, suggesting that PI3K/Akt activation occur downstream of EGFR activation. These findings suggest that NFD inhibited the EGF-induced invasion and migration of MDA-MB-231 cells via EGFR-dependent PI3K/Akt signaling, leading to the down-regulation of MMP-9 expression. These results provide a novel mechanism to explain the role of NFD as a potent anti-metastatic agent in MDA-MB-231 cells.
23328126	Omega-3 Fatty acids reduce adipose tissue macrophages in human subjects with insulin resistance.	Fish oils (FOs) have anti-inflammatory effects and lower serum triglycerides. This study examined adipose and muscle inflammatory markers after treatment of humans with FOs and measured the effects of ω-3 fatty acids on adipocytes and macrophages in vitro. Insulin-resistant, nondiabetic subjects were treated with Omega-3-Acid Ethyl Esters (4 g/day) or placebo for 12 weeks. Plasma macrophage chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) levels were reduced by FO, but the levels of other cytokines were unchanged. The adipose (but not muscle) of FO-treated subjects demonstrated a decrease in macrophages, a decrease in MCP-1, and an increase in capillaries, and subjects with the most macrophages demonstrated the greatest response to treatment. Adipose and muscle ω-3 fatty acid content increased after treatment; however, there was no change in insulin sensitivity or adiponectin. In vitro, M1-polarized macrophages expressed high levels of MCP-1. The addition of ω-3 fatty acids reduced MCP-1 expression with no effect on TNF-α. In addition, ω-3 fatty acids suppressed the upregulation of adipocyte MCP-1 that occurred when adipocytes were cocultured with macrophages. Thus, FO reduced adipose macrophages, increased capillaries, and reduced MCP-1 expression in insulin-resistant humans and in macrophages and adipocytes in vitro; however, there was no measureable effect on insulin sensitivity.
2886642	Effects of ORF 17583, other histamine H2-receptor antagonists and omeprazole on gastric acid secretory states in rats and dogs.	ORF 17583, a histamine H2-receptor antagonist, inhibited gastric acid secretion in pylorus-ligated rats (ED50 = 4.9 mg/kg intraduodenal; 3.4 mg/kg p.o.; and 0.21 mg/kg i.p.) and in total gastric fistula or Heidenhain pouch dogs stimulated by betazole (ED50 = 0.12 mg/kg p.o. and 0.08 mg/kg i.v.), histamine, tetragastrin, bethanechol, 2-deoxy-D-glucose or a meal (ED50 values ranged from 0.11-0.26 mg/kg p.o.). The nonspecific inhibition of gastric acid by ORF 17583 supports the existence of interdependence between histamine and the gastrin and cholinergic receptors on the parietal cell surface. Antisecretory potency of ORF 17583 after intraduodenal administration in pylorus-ligated rats was 6.4 times greater than cimetidine, 1.8 times greater than ranitidine, equal to that of omeprazole and 8 times less than that of famotidine. Oral antisecretory potency of ORF 17583 in gastric fistula dogs was 31 times greater than cimetidine, 3.7 times greater than ranitidine and equal to that of omeprazole and famotidine. Studies using equieffective antisecretory doses of ORF 17583 and ranitidine in dogs suggested that ORF 17583 has a short duration of antisecretory activity similar to that of ranitidine.
23512732	Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate Inhibits Collagen Production of Nasal Polyp-Derived Fibroblasts.	Nasal polyps are chronic inflammatory conditions characterized by myofibroblast differentiation and extracelluar matrix accumulation. The major catechin from green tea is (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), which has garnered attention for its potential to prevent oxidative stress-related diseases. The purpose of this study was twofold: (i) to determine the effect of EGCG on fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts and extracellular matrix accumulation in transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1-induced nasal polyp-derived fibroblasts (NPDFs) and (ii) to determine if the antioxidative effect of EGCG on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in TGF-β1-induced NPDFs is involved in the aforementioned processes. TGF-β1-induced NPDFs were treated with or without EGCG. α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and collagen type I mRNA were analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. α-SMA protein was also detected using immunofluorescent staining. The amount of total soluble collagen was analyzed by Sircol collagen assay. ROS activity was measured by the nitroblue tetrazolium reduction assay and visualized by fluorescent microscopy. EGCG significantly inhibited expressions of α-SMA and collagen type I mRNA and reduced α-SMA and collagen protein levels at concentrations of 10-20 µg/mL. EGCG also inhibited TGF-β1-induced ROS production at the same concentrations. These results suggest the possibility that EGCG may be effective at inhibiting the development of nasal polyps through an anti-oxidant effect. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
8380639	Cloning of another human serotonin receptor (5-HT1F): a fifth 5-HT1 receptor subtype coupled to the inhibition of adenylate cyclase.	An intronless gene encoding an additional human serotonin (5-HT) 5-HT1-like receptor subtype was isolated from a human genomic library with probes obtained from degenerate PCR primers used to amplify 5-HT-receptor-specific sequences. The highest degree of homology was found with the 5-HT1E subtype (70%) and the 5-HT1D alpha (63%) and 5-HT1D beta (60%) receptors. RNA for this gene was detected in the human brain but was not detected in kidney, liver, spleen, heart, pancreas, and testes. High-affinity (Kd = 9.2 nM) 3H-labeled 5-HT binding was detected. Competition studies revealed the following rank order of potencies for serotonergic ligands: 5-HT > sumatriptan >> 5-carboxyamidotryptamine > 8-hydroxy-2(di-1-propylamino)tetralin > spiperone. 5-HT produced a dose-dependent inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation (EC50 = 7.9 nM) in transfected cells. These properties distinguish this receptor from any previously characterized and establish a fifth 5-HT1-like receptor subtype (5-HT1F) coupled to the inhibition of adenylate cyclase.
9141486	Identification of a vitamin K-dependent carboxylase in the venom duct of a Conus snail.	Peptides from the venom ducts of cone snails (genus Conus) contain gamma-carboxyglutamate residues. The gamma-glutamyl carboxylase responsible for this post-translational modification is localized in the microsomal fraction, strictly dependent on vitamin K, activated by ammonium sulfate, and is associated with endogenous substrate. The K(m) of the enzyme for vitamin K is comparable to that for the bovine carboxylase. However, a propeptide containing substrate related to the blood coagulation protein factor IX, a highly efficient substrate for the bovine enzyme, was poorly carboxylated by the Conus enzyme, suggesting differences in gamma-carboxylase recognition signal sequences and/or structural requirements at the carboxylation site.
17020532	Corticosteroid design for the treatment of asthma: structural insights and the therapeutic potential of soft corticosteroids.	Inhaled and intranasal corticosteroids (ICSs) still are the most effective treatment available for allergic airway diseases and are likely to remain the cornerstone of managing persistent asthma/allergic rhinitis in the foreseeable future. Even if the therapeutic index of this class increased significantly with the introduction of newer corticosteroids, and even if new therapeutic potentials are beginning to emerge with our increasing understanding of the mechanisms of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and rhinitis, corticosteroid development still remains a very important field for drug designers. After a brief review of issues related to the structure-activity relationships of glucocorticoids and the main determinants of their receptor-binding affinity at the glucocorticoid receptor, the main focus of the present article will be on the development of soft corticosteroids, as they are particularly well suited to separate local activity from systemic side effects, which still is an important issue for ICSs. Design consideration required in the search for safe and effective soft drugs on one hand, and safe and effective ICSs on the other hand, will be briefly discussed and illustrated with a number of cases, in particular, with that of loteprednol etabonate and etiprednol dicloacetate, soft corticosteroids that are being developed for a full spectrum of therapeutic applications including asthma and allergic rhinitis.
23333897	Activation of Rac1 GTPase by nanoparticulate structures in human macrophages.	Inflammatory activation of alveolar macrophages by ambient particles can be facilitated via Toll-like receptors (TLR). The action of TLR agonists and antagonists has been reported to depend on the formation of nanoparticulate structures. Aim of the present study was to identify the signaling pathways induced by nanoparticulate structures in human macrophages, which might be critical for inflammatory cell activation. METHODS: Studies were performed in primary human alveolar macrophages or in differentiated THP-1 macrophages. Silica nanoparticles were prepared by Stöber synthesis and characterized by dynamic light scattering and scanning electron microscopy. Mycobacterial DNA was isolated from Mycobacterium bovis BCG, and nanoparticle formation was assessed by atomic force microscopy and dynamic light scattering. Actin polymerization was measured by phalloidin-TRITC staining, and cell activation was determined by reverse transcription quantitative PCR analysis, L929 cytotoxicity assay (cytokine induction), and pull-down assays (Rho GTPases). RESULTS: In contrast to immune stimulatory sequence ISS 1018, BCG DNA spontaneously formed nanoparticulate structures and induced actin polymerization as did synthetic silica nanoparticles. Co-incubation with silica nanoparticles amplified the responsiveness of macrophages toward the TLR9 ligand ISS 1018. The activation of Rac1 was induced by silica nanoparticles as well as BCG DNA and is suggested as the critical signaling event inducing both cytoskeleton changes as well as inflammatory cell activation. CONCLUSION: Nanoparticles can induce signaling pathways, which amplify an inflammatory response in macrophages.
10490901	Stimulation by transforming growth factor-alpha of DNA synthesis and proliferation of adult rat hepatocytes in primary cultures: modulation by alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor agonists.	We investigated the effects of transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha) on DNA synthesis and proliferation in primary cultures of adult rat hepatocytes and examined the influence of alpha and beta adrenoceptor agonists on the TGF-alpha-induced responses. TGF-alpha (1.0 ng/ml) produced a 4.1-fold elevation of DNA synthesis during 3 h of culture and a 1.2-fold increase in the nucleus number (proliferation) during 4 h of culture at a cell density of 3.3 x 10(4) cells/cm(2). The TGF-alpha-induced hepatocyte DNA synthesis and proliferation were dose-dependent at EC(50) values of 0.36 ng/ml and 0.45 ng/ml, respectively. Hepatocyte DNA synthesis and proliferation induced by 1.0 ng/ml TGF-alpha did not reduce even at higher initial plating densities (5.0 x 10(4) and 1.0 x 10(5) cells/cm(2)). Increasing concentrations of the beta(2) adrenoceptor agonist metaproterenol (10(-7)-10(-6) M) markedly reduced the proliferative effects of TGF-alpha, whereas those of the alpha(2) adrenoceptor agonist 5-bromo-6-[2-imidazolin-2-yl-amino]-quinoxaline (UK-14304; 10(-6)-10(-5) M) and the alpha(1) adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine (10(-7)-10(-6) M) significantly potentiated the TGF-alpha action. The proliferative effects of TGF-alpha (1.0 ng/ml) were not affected significantly by a monoclonal antiepidermal growth factor receptor antibody (1-100 ng/ml) and were almost completely blocked by specific inhibitors of signal transducers such as genistein (10(-5) M), 1-6[[17beta-3methoxyestra-1,3, 5(10)-trien-17-yl]amino]hexyl]-1H-pyrrol2,5-dione (U-73122; 0(-5) M), wortmannin (5 x 10(-7) M), sphingosine (5 x 10(-6) M), 2'-amino-3'-methoxyflavone (PD98059; 5 x 10(-5) M), and rapamycin (10 ng/ml). These results suggest that among the elements that link signals of cell surface receptor to the nucleus, the proliferative action of TGF-alpha is mediated, at least, by tyrosine kinase, phospholipase C, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, protein kinase C, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, and ribosomal protein p70 S6 kinase.
16597625	Loss of a primordial identity element for a mammalian mitochondrial aminoacylation system.	In mammalian mitochondria the translational machinery is of dual origin with tRNAs encoded by a simplified and rapidly evolving mitochondrial (mt) genome and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS) coded by the nuclear genome, and imported. Mt-tRNAs are atypical with biased sequences, size variations in loops and stems, and absence of residues forming classical tertiary interactions, whereas synthetases appear typical. This raises questions about identity elements in mt-tRNAs and adaptation of their cognate mt-aaRSs. We have explored here the human mt-aspartate system in which a prokaryotic-type AspRS, highly similar to the Escherichia coli enzyme, recognizes a bizarre tRNA(Asp). Analysis of human mt-tRNA(Asp) transcripts confirms the identity role of the GUC anticodon as in other aspartylation systems but reveals the non-involvement of position 73. This position is otherwise known as the site of a universally conserved major aspartate identity element, G73, also known as a primordial identity signal. In mt-tRNA(Asp), position 73 can be occupied by any of the four nucleotides without affecting aspartylation. Sequence alignments of various AspRSs allowed placing Gly-269 at a position occupied by Asp-220, the residue contacting G73 in the crystallographic structure of E. coli AspRS-tRNA(Asp) complex. Replacing this glycine by an aspartate renders human mt-AspRS more discriminative to G73. Restriction in the aspartylation identity set, driven by a rapid mutagenic rate of the mt-genome, suggests a reverse evolution of the mt-tRNA(Asp) identity elements in regard to its bacterial ancestor.
19928382	The roles of dopamine transport inhibition and dopamine release facilitation in wake enhancement and rebound hypersomnolence induced by dopaminergic agents.	STUDY OBJECTIVE: Rebound hypersomnolence (RHS: increased sleep following increased wake) is a limiting side-effect of many wake-promoting agents. In particular, RHS in the first few hours following wake appears to be associated with dopamine (DA)-releasing agents, e.g., amphetamine, but whether it can also be produced by DA transporter (DAT) inhibition alone is unknown. In these studies, DA-releasing and DAT-inhibiting agents and their interaction were systematically examined for their ability to increase wake and induce RHS. DESIGN: Chronically implanted rats were evaluated in a blinded, pseudo-randomized design. PARTICIPANTS: 237 rats were used in these studies with 1 week between repeat tests. INTERVENTIONS: Animals were habituated overnight and dosed the next day, 5 h after lights on, with test agents. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Sleep/wake activityand RHS were evaluated using EEG/EMG recording up to 22 h post dosing. In vitro dopamine release was evaluated in rat synaptosomes. At doses that produced equal increases in wake, DA-releasing (amphetamine, methamphetamine, phentermine) and several DAT-inhibiting agents (cocaine, bupropion, and methylphenidate) produced RHS during the first few hours after the onset of sleep recovery. However, other DAT-inhibiting agents (mazindol, nomifensine, GBR-12909, and GBR-12935) did not produce RHS. Combination treatment with amphetamine and nomifensine produced waking activity greater than the sum of their individual activities alone while ameliorating the amphetamine-like RHS. In rat synaptosomes, nomifensine reduced the potency of amphetamine to induce DA release approximately 270-fold, potentially explaining its action in ameliorating amphetamine-induced RHS. CONCLUSIONS: All DA releasing agents tested, and some DAT-inhibiting agents, produced RHS at equal wake-promoting doses. Thus amphetamine-like DA release appears sufficient for inducing RHS, but additional properties (pharmacologic and/or pharmacokinetic) evidently underlie RHS of other DAT inhibitors. Enhancing wake while mitigating RHS can be achieved by combining DAT-inhibiting and DA-releasing agents.
16964330	Antifungal agents: mode of action in yeast cells.	Different kinds of mycoses, especially invasive, have become an important public health problem as their incidence has increased dramatically in the last decades in relation to AIDS, hematological malignancies, transplant recipients and other immunosuppressed individuals. Management of fungal infections is markedly limited by problems of drug safety, resistance and effectiveness profile. Current therapy for invasive mycoses uses a relatively reduced number of antifungal drugs, such as amphotericin B, fluconazole and itraconazole. Other new antifungal agents from old and new chemical families, like voriconazole, posaconazole, ravuconazole, caspofungin and micafungin, have been introduced into the armamentarium for fungal infections management. This review is focused on the mode of action of those antifungal drugs used against pathogenic yeasts. The interaction of amphotericin B with ergosterol and other membrane sterols results in the production of aqueous pores of drug and the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway is the target of the allylamines, phenylmorpholines and azole antifungal agents. The main molecular target of azole antifungals is the cytochrome P-450 protein Erg11p/Cyp51p. Echinocandins, a new class of antifungal drugs, are fungal secondary metabolites that act against beta-1-3-D-glucan synthesis. The phenylmorpholines, of which amorolfine is the sole representative in human therapy, affect two targets in the ergosterol pathway: Erg24p (delta 14 reductase) and Erg2p (delta 8-delta 7 isomerase). The sordarins group are protein synthesis inhibitors that work by blocking the function of fungal translation elongation factor 2. Other protein inhibitors are zofimarin, BE31045, SCH57504, xylarin, hypoxysordarin and GR135402. In order to overcome the problems derived from the exploitation of azole drugs, macrolides and echinocandins, novel targets were explored. Proposed antifungal drugs have been developed against potential targets like the N-myristylation of fungal proteins, with inhibitors like myristate and histidine analogues or myristoylpeptide derivatives, aminobenzothiazoles, quinolines and benzofurans. Polymerization of cell wall carbohydrates from uridine di-phospho sugars is another potential target.
15037867	Inter-relationships of intermediate phenotypes for serotonin function, impulsivity, and a 5-HT2A candidate allele: His452Tyr.	Central serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) function has a role in a range of genetically influenced psychiatric diagnoses and behaviors. Several human 5-HT receptor polymorphisms are 'candidate alleles', altering in vitro function, and potentially affecting behavior and drug response. The 5-HT(2A) His452Tyr polymorphism alters signal transduction, and has been associated with diminished efficacy of clozapine in schizophrenia. Another 5-HT(2A) receptor polymorphism consists of the silent thymidine-cytosine substitution (102T>C), which has been controversially associated with schizophrenia. We investigated the role of His452Tyr and the 102T>C in behavior and in vivo intermediate biochemical phenotypes. Intracellular 5-HT-induced Ca(2+) release by platelets and fenfluramine-induced prolactin release by pituitary were evaluated in 27 psychiatrically interviewed subjects (including both impulsive patients and controls) stratified by His452Tyr genotype and also genotyped for a second 5-HT(2A) polymorphism, 102T>C. Subjects with increased measures of impulsivity showed decreased postreceptor 5-HT function, as indicated by reduced 5-HT-induced Ca(2+) release, but no alteration in net 5-HT function, as measured by fenfluramine response. No significant effects of either polymorphism were associated with altered 5-HT-induced calcium response or fenfluramine-stimulated prolactin release. One available Tyr452/Tyr452 homozygote had diminished Ca(2+) release and one of the highest levels of fenfluramine response. Although not statistically significant, the effect of the T102C, but not the His452Tyr, genotype on prolactin level change over time was associated with a medium to large strength of association (treatment magnitude of T(2)=0.10), suggesting that further study is warranted.
23585333	Tandem Assays of Protein and Glucose with Functionalized Core/Shell Particles Based on Magnetic Separation and Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering.	Tandem assays of protein and glucose in combination with mannose-functionalized Fe3 O4 @SiO2 and Ag@SiO2 tag particles have promising potential in effective magnetic separation and highly sensitive and selective SERS assays of biomaterials. It is for the first time that tandem assay of glucose is developed using SERS based on the Con A-sandwiched microstructures between the functionalized magnetic and tag particles.
15465035	The inhibitory effect of sodium nitroprusside on HIF-1 activation is not dependent on nitric oxide-soluble guanylyl cyclase pathway.	Adaptation to hypoxia and maintenance of O(2) homeostasis involve a wide range of responses that occur at different organizational levels in the body. One of the most important transcription factors that activate the expression of O(2)-regulated genes is hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). Nitric oxide (NO) mediates a variety of biological effects including relaxation of blood vessels and cytotoxicity of activated macrophages. We investigated the effect of the clinically used nitrates nitroglycerin (NTG), isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) on HIF-1-mediated transcriptional responses to hypoxia. We demonstrate that among the three nitrates, only SNP inhibits HIF-1 activation in response to hypoxia. In contrast, NTG or ISDN does not affect HIF-1 activity. SNP inhibits the accumulation of HIF-1alpha, the regulatory subunit of HIF-1, and the transcriptional activation of HIF-1alpha via a mechanism that is not dependent on either NO or soluble guanylate cyclase.
23380568	Association of serum proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 with carotid intima media thickness in hypertensive subjects.	OBJECTIVE: The clinical significance of the measurement of serum PCSK9 (proprotein subtilisin kexin type 9) is not well defined. This study investigated the association between serum PCSK9 levels and atherosclerosis assessed by carotid intima media thickness (IMT) in hypertensive patients. METHODS: A total of 126 hypertensive patients over the age of 45 were enrolled. The maximum carotid IMT (max-IMT) and the mean carotid IMT (mean-IMT) were measured at the time of enrollment. Clinical and laboratory parameters including serum PCSK9 were analyzed. RESULTS: Patients were divided into tertiles based on serum PCSK9 levels. After adjusting for age, sex, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride, max-IMT was significantly increased in the highest tertile of serum PCSK9 (0.969±0.033 vs 0.959±0.033 vs 1.077±0.033mm, respectively; P=0.026). Mean-IMT showed a tendency to increase across the tertile groups (0.773±0.025 vs 0.790±0.026 vs 0.856±0.025mm, respectively; P=0.059). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that serum PCSK9 was independently associated with carotid IMT (max-IMT: β=0.212, P=0.016; mean-IMT: β=0.184, P=0.04). CONCLUSION: The present study is the first to report the association between serum PCSK9 levels and carotid IMT in hypertensive patients. These results suggest that serum PCSK9 may have a certain role in early pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.
14716684	Use of the norepinephrine transporter as a reporter gene for non-invasive imaging of genetically modified cells.	BACKGROUND: The norepinephrine transporter (NET) is a high-affinity transporter for catecholamines. Its expression is almost exclusively restricted to the sympathetic nervous system. In this study we evaluated whether the NET can be used as a reporter gene for non-invasive imaging of genetically modified cells with radiolabeled probes. METHODS: Human A431, HT1080 and murine CMS-5 cells were retrovirally transduced with bovine NET cDNA. Transduced and parental cells were incubated in vitro with [(131)I]meta-iodobenzylguanidine ([(131)I]MIBG). The specificity of tracer uptake was determined by adding the NET inhibitor imipramine. Rat PC12 cells served as positive controls. Parental and A431NET cells were xenotransplanted into nude mice and tumor uptake of [(123)I]MIBG in vivo was determined after tracer administration. RESULTS: In vitro stably transduced cells showed a 66- to 120-fold higher [(131)I]MIBG uptake than parental cells. Incubation with imipramine reduced [(131)I]MIBG uptake of transduced cells to the level found in parental cells. More than 70% of the initial radioactivity was retained in all transduced cell lines after 2 h incubation with tracer-free medium. [(131)I]MIBG uptake in PC12 cells, which express the NET endogenously, was 20- to 28-fold lower than in transduced cells. In vivo, A431NET tumors demonstrated a 33-fold higher [(123)I]MIBG uptake than parental tumors. Gamma camera images 24 h after tracer injection showed no tracer uptake in parental A431 tumors, but clear images of A431NET tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Transduction of tumor cells with NET cDNA causes highly specific uptake and significant retention of catecholamine analogs in vitro and in vivo. These characteristics make the NET suitable as a reporter gene for non-invasive monitoring of gene transfer.
23461969	Theoretical Characterization of Galanin Receptor Type 3 (Gal3 ) and Its Interaction with Agonist (GALANIN) and Antagonists (SNAP 37889 and SNAP 398299): An In Silico Analysis.	In this study, we report on modeling of galanin receptor type 3 and its interaction with agonist and antagonists using in silico methodologies. Comparative structural modeling of galanin receptor type 3 was based on multiple templates. With the availability of reported selective galanin receptor type 3 antagonists, docking was carried out into the predicted binding site. Similarly, galanin, a reported agonist, was also modeled and then docked into the receptor's active site. CoMFA models were developed using ligand-based (q(2)  = 0.537, r(2)  = 0.961, noc = 5), and receptor-guided (docked mode 1: q(2)  = 0.574, r(2)  = 0.946, noc = 5), (docked mode 2: q(2)  = 0.499, r(2)  = 0.954, noc = 5) alignment schemes. CoMFA contour analysis revealed that bulky substitution around the meta position of the phenyl ring, as well as optimal substitution (para) of the phenyl ring, could produce molecules with improved activity. We also found that Gln79, Ile82, Asp86, Trp88, His99, Ile102, Tyr103, Glu170, Pro174, Ala175, Asp185, Arg273, His277, and Tyr281 are crucial, and mutational studies on these residues could be helpful. The results obtained from this study can further be exploited for structure-based drug design and also help the researchers to identify novel antagonists targeting galanin receptor type 3.
22981737	Specific binding of collagen Q to the neuromuscular junction is exploited to cure congenital myasthenia and to explore bases of myasthenia gravis.	Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is anchored to the synaptic basal lamina via a triple helical collagen Q (ColQ) in the form of asymmetric AChE (AChE/ColQ). The C-terminal domain of ColQ binds to MuSK, the muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase, that mediates a signal for acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering at the NMJ. ColQ also binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans including perlecan. Congenital defects of ColQ cause endplate AChE deficiency. A single intravenous administration of adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (AAV8)-COLQ to Colq-/- mice rescued motor functions, synaptic transmission, and the ultrastructure of NMJ. We also injected AAV1-COLQ-IRES-EGFP to the left tibialis anterior and observed colocalization of AChE/ColQ at all the examined NMJs of the non-injected limbs. Additionally, injection of purified recombinant AChE/ColQ protein complex into gluteus maximus accumulated AChE in non-injected forelimbs. These observations suggest that the tissue-targeting signal of ColQ can be exploited to specifically deliver the transgene product to the target tissue. MuSK antibody-positive myasthenia gravis (MG) accounts for 5-15% of autoimmune MG. As AChR deficiency is typically mild and as cholinesterase inhibitors are generally ineffective or worsen myasthenic symptoms, we asked if the patient's MuSK-IgG interferes with binding of ColQ to MuSK. In vitro overlay of AChE/ColQ to muscle sections of Colq-/- mice revealed that MuSK-IgG blocks binding of ColQ to the NMJ. In vitro plate-binding of MuSK to ColQ disclosed that MuSK-IgG exerts a dose-dependent block of MuSK-ColQ interaction. In addition, passive transfer of MuSK-IgG to mice reduced the size and density of ColQ to ∼10% of controls and had a lesser effect on the sizes and densities of AChR and MuSK. Elucidation of molecular mechanisms of specific binding of ColQ to the NMJ enabled us to ameliorate devastating myasthenic symptoms of Colq-/- mice and to reveal bases of anti-MuSK MG.
23333305	RIF1 is essential for 53BP1-dependent nonhomologous end joining and suppression of DNA double-strand break resection.	The appropriate execution of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair is critical for genome stability and tumor avoidance. 53BP1 and BRCA1 directly influence DSB repair pathway choice by regulating 5' end resection, but how this is achieved remains uncertain. Here we report that Rif1(-/-) mice are severely compromised for 53BP1-dependent class switch recombination (CSR) and fusion of dysfunctional telomeres. The inappropriate accumulation of RIF1 at DSBs in S phase is antagonized by BRCA1, and deletion of Rif1 suppresses toxic nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) induced by PARP inhibition in Brca1-deficient cells. Mechanistically, RIF1 is recruited to DSBs via the N-terminal phospho-SQ/TQ domain of 53BP1, and DSBs generated by ionizing radiation or during CSR are hyperresected in the absence of RIF1. Thus, RIF1 and 53BP1 cooperate to block DSB resection to promote NHEJ in G1, which is antagonized by BRCA1 in S phase to ensure a switch of DSB repair mode to homologous recombination.
2858236	Cardiovascular effects of bevantolol, a selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist with a novel pharmacological profile.	Bevantolol was more potent in blocking the chronotropic than the hypotensive effects of isoprenaline in pithed rats. Bevantolol itself induced bradycardia, so that it was not possible to estimate the pA2 from nonparallel dose-response curves relating isoprenaline concentration to tachycardia. Bevantolol caused hypertension in pithed rats, an effect attenuated by phentolamine, implying that bevantolol may be an alpha-adrenoceptor agonist. Bevantolol potentiated the pressor effects of noradrenaline, the maximum potentiation equalling that produced by prior chemical sympathectomy with guanethidine, implying that bevantolol may block noradrenaline uptake. In isolated atria bevantolol-induced bradycardia was associated with a positive shift in take-off potential, a reduction in the maximum rate of depolarization (Vmax), and a lengthening of action potential duration (APD). No change in the slope of the slow diastolic depolarization occurred except at the highest concentration (18 mumol l(-1). In atrial and ventricular muscle bevantolol reduced Vmax and overshoot potential, implying reduction of fast inward sodium current (Class I antiarrhythmic action). In pithed rats bevantolol lengthened the P-R interval in the ECG, and produced atrioventricular (A-V) block, and bundle-branch block. In isolated A-V nodal preparations, intranodal conduction time was greatly increased, implying restriction of inward current through calcium channels responsible for nodal depolarization. Bevantolol had no negative inotropic effect in pithed rats, or in isolated atria, and did not alter the positive inotropic effect of raised extracellular calcium concentration, implying absence of restriction of current through calcium channels controlling contraction of the myocardium.
23427019	Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering on Non-SERS Active Substrates and In Situ Electrochemical Study based on a Single Gold Microshell.	A single gold microshell, which was elaborately fabricated to carry numerous hot spots on its own surface, enabled the acquisition of the SERS spectra from the molecules on non-SERS active substrates such as Si/SiO2 , ITO, and glass. A self-assembled monolayer of 11-mercaptoundecanols on the gold microshell offered an easy and reliable way to electrically insulate from the underlying flat Pt electrode and accomplish in situ monitoring the electrochemical reaction with minimal interference.
23361846	Role of cytochrome P4502B6 in methadone metabolism and clearance.	Methadone N-demethylation in vitro is catalyzed by hepatic cytochrome P4502B6 (CYP2B6) and CYP3A4, but clinical disposition is often attributed to CYP3A4. This investigation tested the hypothesis that CYP2B6 is a prominent CYP isoform responsible for clinical methadone N-demethylation and clearance, using the in vivo mechanism-based CYP2B6 inhibitor ticlopidine, given orally for 4 days. A preliminary clinical investigation with the CYP3A4/5 substrate probe alfentanil established that ticlopidine did not inhibit intestinal or hepatic CYP3A4/5. Subjects received intravenous plus oral (deuterium-labeled) racemic methadone before and after ticlopidine. Ticlopidine significantly and stereoselectively (S > R) inhibited methadone N-demethylation, decreasing plasma metabolite/methadone area under the curve ratios and metabolite formation clearances. Ticlopidine also significantly increased the dose-adjusted plasma area under the curve for R- and S-methadone by 20% and 60%, respectively, after both intravenous and oral dosing. CYP2B6 inhibition reduces methadone N-demethylation and clearance, and alters methadone concentrations, demonstrating an important role for CYP2B6 in clinical methadone disposition.
23317163	Cellular signaling crosstalk between multiple receptors for investigation of pathophysiology in multifactorial diseases--what is clinically-relevant crosstalk?	Recently, genomics and proteomics have been utilized as advanced tools for investigation of cellular signaling pathways and molecular interactions, and elucidated promiscuous networks composed of numerous interactions among pathways. However, some of these interactions are considered to be simply contributing to background 'noise' and others are as 'crosstalk' biologically-relevant to cellular physiology, leading to synergy effects more than additive responses in an entire organism. Effort is now required to determine which interactions truly contribute to final physiological output. A receptor is the prime example of connectors among the networks. It functions, not simply as a signaling gateway, but also as an active trader by forming inter-receptor dimers. Furthermore, various receptors can modulate the function of the other receptors by input to common intracellular signaling pathways, establishing functional crosstalk among networks. Our findings by combined analyses of gene polymorphisms of two separate genes present evidences that such is the case with human body in a clinical setting: 1) an integrated effect of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and protease activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) on susceptibility to airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), and 2) a crosstalk effect between muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChRs) and β(2) adrenoceptor (β(2)AR) on bronchodilatory response to anticholinergic agents in patients with COPD. These results indicate that these interactions are unlikely to be 'noise' but functionally-relevant 'crosstalk' in a human body. This review attempts to highlight the clinically-relevant 'crosstalk' paradigm in a human body which provides us a novel insight necessary to investigate pathophysiology in common multifactorial diseases and to develop new drugs.
23201124	Substrates of IAP ubiquitin ligases identified with a designed orthogonal E3 ligase, the NEDDylator.	Inhibitors of Apoptosis Protein (IAPs) are guardian ubiquitin ligases that keep classic proapoptotic proteins in check. Systematic identification of additional IAP substrates is challenged by the heterogeneity and sheer number of ubiquitinated proteins (>5,000). Here we report a powerful catalytic tagging tool, the NEDDylator, which fuses a NEDD8 E2-conjugating enzyme, Ubc12, to the ubiquitin ligase, XIAP or cIAP1. This permits transfer of the rare ubiquitin homolog NEDD8 to the ubiquitin E3 substrates, allowing them to be efficiently purified for LC-MS/MS identification. We have identified >50 potential IAP substrates of both cytosolic and mitochondrial origin that bear hallmark N-terminal IAP binding motifs. These substrates include the recently discovered protein phosphatase PGAM5, which we show is proteolytically processed, accumulates in cytosol during apoptosis, and sensitizes cells to death. These studies reveal mechanisms and antagonistic partners for specific IAPs, and provide a powerful technology for labeling binding partners in transient protein-protein complexes.
23296904	Effect of Wine Polyphenol Resveratrol on the Contractions Elicited Electrically or by Norepinephrine in the Rat Portal Vein.	We investigated the effects of resveratrol on rat portal vein (RPV) contractility without endothelium. Contractions were produced by electrical field stimulation of perivascular nerves (EFS), norepinephrine (NE), adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), high K(+) solution and by calcium chloride (CaCl(2) ) in Ca(2+) -free and high K(+) , Ca(2+) -free solution. The EFS-evoked contractions were more sensitive to resveratrol and to NS1619-selective openers of big calcium-sensitive (BK(Ca) ) channels, than NE-evoked contractions. Effects of resveratrol on the ATP-evoked contractions were weak. Blockers of BK(Ca) channels partly inhibited the effect of resveratrol only in EFS-contracted preparations. Western blotting showed that RPV expressed K(Ca) 1.1 protein. Inhibitors of ATP- and voltage-sensitive K(+) channels did not modify the effects of resveratrol. None of the antagonists of K(+) channels affected the resveratrol inhibition of NE-evoked contractions and effect of high concentrations of resveratrol on the EFS-evoked contractions. Resveratrol more potently inhibited CaCl(2) than potassium chloride contractions of RPV. Thus, BK(Ca) channels partly mediate the inhibitory effect of resveratrol on the neurogenic contractions of RPV. The smooth muscle Ca(2+) channels and/or Ca(2+) mobilizing through cells might be involved in the effects of resveratrol on the contractility of RPV. Our results are important for better understanding the impact of resveratrol on the portal circulation. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
23632005	An investigation of the effect of thiamine pyrophosphate on cisplatin-induced oxidative stress and DNA damage in rat brain tissue compared with thiamine: Thiamine and thiamine pyrophosphate effects on cisplatin neurotoxicity.	This study investigated the effects of thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) at dosages of 10 and 20 mg/kg on oxidative stress induced in rat brain tissue with cisplatin and compared this with thiamine. Cisplatin neurotoxicity represents one of the main restrictions on the drug being given in effective doses. Oxidative stress is considered responsible for cisplatin toxicity. Our results showed that cisplatin increased the levels of oxidant parameters such as lipid peroxidation (thio barbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS)) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in brain tissue and suppressed the effects of antioxidants such as total glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). TPP, especially at a dosage of 20 mg/kg, significantly reduced TBARS and MPO levels that increase with cisplatin administration compared with the thiamine group, while TPP significantly increases GSH and SOD levels. In addition, the level of 8-Gua (guanine), a product of DNA damage, was 1.7 ± 0.12 8-hydroxyl guanine (8-OH Gua)/105 Gua in brain tissue in the control group receiving cisplatin, compared with 0.97 ± 0.03 8-OH Gua/105 Gua in the thiamine pyrophosphate (20 mg/kg) group and 1.55 ± 0.11 8-OH Gua/105 Gua in the thiamine (20 mg/kg) group. These results show that thiamine pyrophosphate significantly prevents oxidative damage induced by cisplatin in brain tissue, while the protective effect of thiamine is insignificant.
15726024	Ziprasidone-induced galactorrhea: a case report.	OBJECTIVES: Second-generation antipsychotics presumably lack the typical side effects of conventional antipsychotics. METHODOLOGY: A 34 year old Caucasian woman with ICD-10 diagnosis of Recurrent depressive disorder with current moderate symptoms, and with a history of repeated self-injury was treated with lithium, clonazepam and ziprasidone. RESULTS: On the ninth day of ziprasidone administration, galactorrhea appeared. After 36 days of ziprasidone therapy, galactorrhea persisted. The prolactin plasma level was 28 ng/ml. Thyroid tests (TSH,T3,T4) and the lithium plasma level were within the normal range during ziprasidone treatment. Two weeks after the ziprasidone withdrawal, galactorrhea disappeared and the prolactin level decreased down to 18 ng/ml. CONCLUSION: Psychiatrists should be aware that even second-generation antipsychotics, including ziprasidone, have a propensity to cause side-effects associated with the dopamine D2 receptor blockade, such as galactorrhea.
23454202	Curcumin loaded solid lipid nanoparticles: An efficient formulation approach for cerebral ischemic reperfusion injury in rats.	SCOPE: To evaluate curcumin loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (C-SLNs) in the experimental paradigm of cerebral ischemia (BCCAO model) in rats. METHODS AND RESULTS: Oral administration of free curcumin and C-SLNs (25 and 50mg/kg) was started 5days prior and continued for 3days after BCCAO. Alleviation in behavioral, oxidative and nitrosative stress, acetylcholinesterase, mitochondrial enzyme complexes, and physiological parameters were assessed. Confirmation of effective brain delivery of C-SLNs (p.o) was done using biodistribution studies in mice and confocal microscopy of rat brain section. There was an improvement of 90% in cognition and 52% inhibition of acetylcholinesterase versus cerebral ischemic group (I/R). Neurological scoring improved by 79%. Levels of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione, and mitochondrial complex enzyme activities were significantly increased, while lipid peroxidation, nitrite, and acetylcholinesterase levels decreased (p<0.05) after C-SLNs administration. It is noteworthy to report the restoration of SOD, GSH, catalase, and mitochondrial complex enzyme levels equivalent to sham control values. Gamma-scintigraphic studies show 16.4 and 30 times improvement in brain bioavailability (AUC) upon oral and i.v administration of C-SLNs versus solubilized curcumin (C-S). CONCLUSIONS: Study indicates protective role of curcumin against cerebral ischemic insult; provided it is packaged suitably for improved brain delivery.
11861317	Inhibition of the NMDA response by pregnenolone sulphate reveals subtype selective modulation of NMDA receptors by sulphated steroids.	1. The neurosteroid pregnenolone sulphate (PS) potentiates N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor mediated responses in various neuronal preparations. The NR1 subunit can combine with NR2A, NR2B, NR2C, or NR2D subunits to form functional receptors. Differential NR2 subunit expression in brain and during development raises the question of how the NR2 subunit influences NMDA receptor modulation by neuroactive steroids. 2. We examined the effects of PS on the four diheteromeric NMDA receptor subtypes generated by co-expressing the NR1(100) subunit with each of the four NR2 subunits in Xenopus oocytes. Whereas PS potentiated NMDA-, glutamate-, and glycine-induced currents of NR1/NR2A and NR1/NR2B receptors, it was inhibitory at NR1/NR2C and NR1/NR2D receptors. 3. In contrast, pregnanolone sulphate (3alpha5betaS), a negative modulator of the NMDA receptor that acts at a distinct site from PS, inhibited all four subtypes, but was approximately 4 fold more potent at NR1/NR2C and NR1/NR2D than at NR1/NR2A and NR1/NR2B receptors. 4. These findings demonstrate that residues on the NR2 subunit are key determinants of modulation by PS and 3alpha5betaS. The modulatory effects of PS, but not 3alpha5betaS, on dose-response curves for NMDA, glutamate, and glycine are consistent with a two-state model in which PS either stabilizes or destabilizes the active state of the receptor, depending upon which NR2 subunit is present. 5. The selectivity of sulphated steroid modulators for NMDA receptors of specific subunit composition is consistent with a neuromodulatory role for endogenous sulphated steroids. The results indicate that it may be possible to develop therapeutic agents that target steroid modulatory sites of specific NMDA receptor subtypes.
23292655	Expanding the genetic code in Xenopus laevis oocytes.	Heterologous expression of ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs) in Xenopus laevis oocytes combined with site-directed mutagenesis has been demonstrated to be a powerful approach to study structure-function relationships. In particular, introducing unnatural amino acids (UAAs) has enabled modifications that are not found in natural proteins. However, the current strategy relies on the technically demanding in vitro synthesis of aminoacylated suppressor tRNA. We report here a general method that circumvents this limitation by utilizing orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS)/suppressor tRNA(CUA) pairs to genetically encode UAAs in Xenopus oocytes. We show that UAAs inserted in the N-terminal domain of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) serve as photo-crosslinkers that lock the receptor in a discrete conformational state in response to UV photo treatment. Our method should be generally applicable to studies of other LGICs in Xenopus oocytes.
12795776	A comparison of the beta1-selectivity of three beta1-selective beta-blockers.	OBJECTIVE: To determine the relative beta1-selectivity of three beta-blockers (nebivolol, bisoprolol and atenolol), administered orally at normal therapeutic doses, by assessing their impact on the beta2-mediated, haemodynamic and biochemical responses to a terbutaline infusion, which decreases serum potassium and increases serum glucose and insulin. METHODS: Twenty-four healthy volunteers (14 men, 10 women), with no history of respiratory disease, attended on five separate occasions; beta-blockers (nebivolol 5 mg, bisoprolol 10 mg, atenolol 50 and 100 mg) or placebo were supplied in random order. Three baseline blood samples were collected at 65-85 min post-beta-blocker. A 60-min terbutaline infusion was started 90 min after taking the beta-blocker. Blood samples were taken and blood pressure and heart rate recorded at 15 min intervals up to 30-min post-infusion. Blood samples were analysed for serum potassium, glucose and insulin concentrations. RESULTS: Terbutaline increased heart rate. Pretreatment with nebivolol caused a modest and non-significant reduction in terbutaline-induced tachycardia whilst bisoprolol produced a more marked effect. Atenolol at both 50 and 100 mg doses caused a highly significant reduction in terbutaline-induced tachycardia. All active preparations had a comparable impact on the terbutaline-induced increase in systolic blood pressure, but the drugs had no impact on the changes produced in diastolic blood pressure. After pretreatment with placebo, the terbutaline infusion caused a significant decrease in serum potassium and increases in serum glucose and insulin. Pretreatment with nebivolol had no discernible effect on potassium compared with placebo. In contrast, when compared with either placebo or nebivolol, bisoprolol (P < 0.01) and both doses of atenolol (P < 0.001) significantly attenuated the hypokalaemic effect of terbutaline. Treatment with nebivolol and bisoprolol modestly but significantly reduced the terbutaline-induced increases in glucose (P < 0.05). The blocking effects of both doses of atenolol were highly significant (P < 0.001) when compared with placebo and also significant (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively) when compared with nebivolol and bisoprolol. A similar pattern of responses with the different beta-blocker treatments was observed for the effects on insulin concentrations during the terbutaline infusion. CONCLUSION: The beta1-selectivity of three different beta1-blockers has been demonstrated in healthy volunteers using the blocking of biochemical and haemodynamic responses to a beta2 stimulus. Terbutaline alone caused an increase in heart rate, a rise in systolic blood pressure, a fall in serum potassium and a rise in both serum glucose and insulin. In this study, for both haemodynamic and biochemical responses, atenolol 100 mg had the greatest beta2-blocking effect, nebivolol 5 mg the least. Bisoprolol 10 mg and atenolol 50 mg had intermediate effects; bisoprolol was the more beta1-selective of these two.
23261990	The molecular mystique of tetrodotoxin.	"In many respects tetrodotoxin (TTX) is the quintessential natural toxin. It is unequivocally toxic to mammals with LD(50) values for mice in the range of 10 μg/kg (intraperitoneal), 16 μg/kg (subcutaneous), and 332 μg/kg (oral) (Kao, 1966). Its biothreat status is recognized by its listing as a ""Select Agent"" by the US Department of Health and Human Services which includes regulated agents ""determined to have the potential to pose a severe threat to both human and animal health"" (http://www.selectagents.gov/). It has a well-defined cellular target (i.e., NaV channels) and pharmacological mode of action (i.e., block of nerve and muscle action potentials), and it is an indispensable chemical tool in neuroscience. It is widely distributed in marine and terrestrial ecosystems where it plays a role in the chemical ecology of predator-prey relationships and drives evolutionary selection of TTX-resistance (Hanifin, 2010; Williams, 2010; Zimmer and Ferrer, 2007). Lastly, TTX has acquired a certain mystique in scientific lore attributable to many fascinating aspects of its natural history and molecular interactions as presented in selected summary below. Additional information may be found in other excellent reviews (Fozzard and Lipkind, 2010; Kao, 1966; Lee and Ruben, 2008; Narahashi, 2001, 2008)."
23436267	Inhibitory effect of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of a multireceptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor BMS-690514 in healthy participants: assessing the mechanism of the interaction with physiologically-based pharmacokinetic simulations.	BMS-690514, a selective inhibitor of the ErbB and vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, has shown antitumor activity in early clinical development. The compound is metabolized by multiple enzymes, with CYP3A4 responsible for the largest fraction (34%) of metabolism. It is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in vitro. To assess the effect of ketoconazole on BMS-690514 pharmacokinetics, 17 healthy volunteers received 200 mg BMS-690514 alone followed by 100 mg BMS-690514 with ketoconazole (400 mg once daily for 4 days). The AUC(∞) of 100 mg BMS-690514 concomitantly administered with ketoconazole was similar to that of 200 mg BMS-690514 alone. The dose-normalized C(max) and AUC(∞) of BMS-690514 from the 100-mg BMS-690514/400-mg ketoconazole treatment increased by 55% and 127%, respectively, relative to those from 200 mg BMS-690514 alone. Prediction of the drug-drug interaction (DDI) using a population-based simulator (Simcyp) indicated that, in addition to CYP3A4 inhibition, the inhibition of P-gp by ketoconazole in the intestine, liver, and kidneys must be invoked to fully account for the DDI observed. This finding suggests that the inhibition of P-gp by ketoconazole, along with its effect on CYP3A4, needs to be considered when designing a DDI study of ketoconazole with a victim drug that is a dual substrate.
17581967	Na+/Cl- dipole couples agonist binding to kainate receptor activation.	Kainate-selective ionotropic glutamate receptors (GluRs) require external Na+ and Cl- as well as the neurotransmitter L-glutamate for activation. Although, external anions and cations apparently coactivate kainate receptors (KARs) in an identical manner, it has yet to be established how ions of opposite charge achieve this. An additional complication is that KARs are subject to other forms of cation modulation via extracellular acidification (i.e., protons) and divalent ions. Consequently, other cation species may compete with Na+ to regulate the time KARs remain in the open state. Here we designed experiments to unravel how external ions regulate GluR6 KARs. We show that GluR6 kinetics are unaffected by alterations in physiological pH but that divalent and alkali metal ions compete to determine the time course of KAR channel activity. Additionally, Na+ and Cl- ions coactivate GluR6 receptors by establishing a dipole, accounting for their common effect on KARs. Using charged amino acids as tethered ions, we further demonstrate that the docking order is fixed with cations binding first, followed by anions. Together, our findings identify the dipole as a novel gating feature that couples neurotransmitter binding to KAR activation.
10932681	Drug treatment of obesity.	Drugs to treat obesity can be divided into three groups: those which reduce food intake, those which alter metabolism and those which increase thermogenesis. Monoamines acting on noradrenergic receptors, serotonin receptors, dopamine receptors and histamine receptors can reduce food intake. A number of peptides also affect food intake. The noradrenergic drugs phentermine, diethylpropion, mazindol benzphetamine and phendimetrazine are approved only for short-term use. Sibutramine, a norepinephrine-serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, is approved for long-term use. Orlistat inhibits pancreatic lipase and can block 30% of triglyceride hydrolysis in subjects eating a 30% fat diet. The only thermogenic drug combination that has been tested is ephedrine and caffeine, but this treatment has not been approved by regulating agencies. Leptin is currently in clinical trials and other drugs that may modulate peptide-feeding systems are being developed.
23408434	Neuronatin-mediated aberrant calcium signaling and endoplasmic reticulum stress underlie neuropathology in Lafora disease.	Lafora disease (LD) is a teenage-onset inherited progressive myoclonus epilepsy characterized by the accumulations of intracellular inclusions called Lafora bodies and caused by mutations in protein phosphatase laforin or ubiquitin ligase malin. But how the loss of function of either laforin or malin causes disease pathogenesis is poorly understood. Recently, neuronatin was identified as a novel substrate of malin that regulates glycogen synthesis. Here we demonstrate that the level of neuronatin is significantly up-regulated in the skin biopsy sample of LD patients having mutations in both malin and laforin. Neuronatin is highly expressed in human fetal brain with gradual decrease in expression in developing and adult brain. However, in adult brain, neuronatin is predominantly expressed in parvalbumin-positive GABAergic interneurons and localized in their processes. The level of neuronatin is increased and accumulated as insoluble aggregates in the cortical area of LD brain biopsy samples, and there is also a dramatic loss of parvalbumin-positive GABAergic interneurons. Ectopic expression of neuronatin in cultured neuronal cells results in increased intracellular Ca(2+), endoplasmic reticulum stress, proteasomal dysfunction, and cell death that can be partially rescued by malin. These findings suggest that the neuronatin-induced aberrant Ca(2+) signaling and endoplasmic reticulum stress might underlie LD pathogenesis.
10575045	Effects of chronic antidepressant treatments on serotonin transporter function, density, and mRNA level.	To investigate functional changes in the brain serotonin transporter (SERT) after chronic antidepressant treatment, several techniques were used to assess SERT activity, density, or its mRNA content. Rats were treated by osmotic minipump for 21 d with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) paroxetine or sertraline, the selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor desipramine (DMI), or the monoamine oxidase inhibitor phenelzine. High-speed in vivo electrochemical recordings were used to assess the ability of the SSRI fluvoxamine to modulate the clearance of locally applied serotonin in the CA3 region of hippocampus in drug- or vehicle-treated rats. Fluvoxamine decreased the clearance of serotonin in rats treated with vehicle, DMI, or phenelzine but had no effect on the clearance of serotonin in SSRI-treated rats. SERT density in the CA3 region of the hippocampus of the same rats, assessed by quantitative autoradiography with tritiated cyanoimipramine ([(3)H]CN-IMI), was decreased by 80-90% in SSRI-treated rats but not in those treated with phenelzine or DMI. The serotonin content of the hippocampus was unaffected by paroxetine or sertraline treatment, ruling out neurotoxicity as a possible explanation for the SSRI-induced decrease in SERT binding and alteration in 5-HT clearance. Levels of mRNA for the SERT in the raphe nucleus were also unaltered by chronic paroxetine treatment. Based on these results, it appears that the SERT is downregulated by chronic administration of SSRIs but not other types of antidepressants; furthermore, the downregulation is not caused by decreases in SERT gene expression.
23444963	Kimchi, a fermented vegetable, improves serum lipid profiles in healthy young adults: randomized clinical trial.	Abstract Vegetable-based diets have generally focused on their health benefits including negative associations with the serum cholesterol concentrations. The aim of this study was to investigate whether serum lipid concentrations are influenced by the amount of kimchi intake. For the study, 100 volunteers were assigned to 2 dietary groups, low (15 g/day, n=50) and high (210 g/day, n=50) kimchi intake, and were housed together in a dormitory for 7 days. Identical meals except with different amount of kimchi were provided and subjects were instructed to maintain their normal physical activity. Concentrations of fasting blood glucose (FBG), total glucose, total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-C significantly decreased in both groups after 7 days of kimchi intake, but the effects were dose dependent. Lipid lowering effects of kimchi were more profound in the subjects with total cholesterol and LDL-C level over 190 and 130 mg/dL, respectively, in both groups. FBG was significantly decreased in the high kimchi intake as compared to the low intake group (P=.003). In conclusion, greater consumption of kimchi improved FBG and serum total cholesterol in young healthy adults.
23381882	Mechanisms of Pharmacokinetic Enhancement Between Ritonavir and Saquinavir; Micro/Small Dosing Tests Using Midazolam (CYP3A4), Fexofenadine (p-Glycoprotein), and Pravastatin (OATP1B1) as Probe Drugs.	We investigated the mechanisms of ritonavir-mediated enhancement effect on the pharmacokinetics of saquinavir using in vivo probes for CYP3A4 (midazolam), p-glycoprotein (fexofenadine), and OATP1B1 (pravastatin) following oral micro/small dosing. A cocktail of the drugs (2 mg of saquinavir, 100 µg of each probe) was administered to eight healthy volunteers (phase 1), and then coadministered with 20 mg (phase 2) and 100 mg (phase 3) of ritonavir. Plasma concentrations of the drugs were measured by validated LC-MS/MS methods. The mean plasma AUC(0-24) (pg hour/mL) of saquinavir at phases 1, 2, and 3 was 101, 2 540, and 23 900 (P < .01), respectively. The relative area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC)(0-24) ratios of midazolam and fexofenadine at phases 1, 2, and 3 were 1:5.9:14.7 (P < .01), and 1:1.4:2.2 (P < .01-.05), respectively. In contrast, there was no difference in the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin. Inhibition of intestinal and hepatic CYP3A-mediated metabolism, and intestinal p-glycoprotein-mediated efflux of saquinavir, but not OATP1B1, is involved in the enhancement mechanism. Micro/small dosing is useful for examining the mechanism of drug interactions without safety concern.
20193764	Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and memantine for neuroenhancement in healthy individuals: a systematic review.	The term neuroenhancement refers to improvement in the cognitive, emotional and motivational functions of healthy individuals through, inter alia, the use of drugs. Of known interventions, psychopharmacology provides readily available options, such as the anti-dementia drugs, e.g. acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine) and memantine. Based on a systematic review we found that expectations about the potential of these drugs exceed their actual effects, as has been demonstrated in randomised controlled trials. Both single and repeated dose trials were included in the systematic review, however repeated dose trials have only been conducted for donepezil. In six small trials lasting 14-42 days, the following results emerged: donepezil improved the retention of training on complex aviation tasks and verbal memory for semantically processed words. In one study episodic memory was improved, whereas in others it remained unaffected by donepezil. In a sleep deprivation trial, donepezil reduced the memory and attention deficits resulting from 24h of sleep deprivation. Two studies reported even transient negative effects. Regarding the safety profile of donepezil, these studies found that it was rather well tolerated. In any case, since large longitudinal studies are not available no conclusions can be drawn. Seven small studies about the effects of a single dose of memantine, and one study with a single dose of rivastigmine have been reported. Again, these studies are not adequate to answer our research question. If, as here and elsewhere suggested, the concept of pharmaceutical neuroenhancement is not to be rejected in principle, the decision of healthy individuals to take drugs for the purpose of neuroenhancement should be based on exhaustive information. At the moment, the research that would support or oppose the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and memantine for neuroenhancement by healthy individuals has not yet been performed.
23557686	Does 4-tert-octylphenol affect estrogen signaling pathways in bank vole Leydig cells and tumor mouse Leydig cells in vitro?	Primary Leydig cells obtained from bank vole testes and the established tumor Leydig cell line (MA-10) have been used to explore the effects of 4-tert-octylphenol (OP). Leydig cells were treated with two concentrations of OP (10(-4)M, 10(-8)M) alone or concomitantly with anti-estrogen ICI 182,780 (1μM). In OP-treated bank vole Leydig cells, inhomogeneous staining of estrogen receptor α (ERα) within cell nuclei was found, whereas it was of various intensity among MA-10 Leydig cells. The expression of ERα mRNA and protein decreased in both primary and immortalized Leydig cells independently of OP dose. ICI partially reversed these effects at mRNA level while at protein level abrogation was found only in vole cells. Dissimilar action of OP on cAMP and androgen production was also observed. This study provides further evidence that OP shows estrogenic properties acting on Leydig cells. However, its effect is diverse depending on the cellular origin.
23434931	TCF7L2 Variation and Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy.	Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is the most severe vision-threatening complication of diabetes. To investigated genetic association between TCF7L2 and PDR in Caucasian type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its functional consequences, 383 T2DM patients with PDR (T2DM-PDR) and 756 T2DM patients without diabetic retinopathy (T2DM-no DR) were genotyped with rs7903146 in TCF7L2. We found that risk allele (T) frequency of rs7903146 was significantly higher in T2DM-PDR patients (allelic P = 2.52E-04). In lymphoblastoid cells induced to undergo endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by treatment of tunicamycin, higher fold change of TCF7L2 and VEGFA mRNA levels were observed in rs7903146-TT cells than that in rs7903146-CC cells (P = 0.02 for TCF7L2; P = 0.004 for VEGFA), suggesting ER stress plays a role in PDR pathogenesis. Silencing TCF7L2 resulted in decreased mRNA levels of both TCF7L2 and VEGFA (P < 0.001). Retinas of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) mice (a model for PDR) had higher TCF7L2 and VEGFA mRNA levels than controls (P = 2.9E-04 for TCF7L2; P = 1.9E-07 for VEGFA). Together, our study showed that TCF7L2-rs7903146 is associated with PDR in Caucasian T2DM and suggested TCF7L2 promoted pathological retinal neovascularization via ER stress-dependent upregulation of VEGFA.
17032653	Retinol dehydrogenase (RDH12) protects photoreceptors from light-induced degeneration in mice.	RDH12 has been suggested to be one of the retinol dehydrogenases (RDH) involved in the vitamin A recycling system (visual cycle) in the eye. Loss of function mutations in the RDH12 gene were recently reported to be associated with autosomal recessive childhood-onset severe retinal dystrophy. Here we show that RDH12 localizes to the photoreceptor inner segments and that deletion of this gene in mice slows the kinetics of all-trans-retinal reduction, delaying dark adaptation. However, accelerated 11-cis-retinal production and increased susceptibility to light-induced photoreceptor apoptosis were also observed in Rdh12(-/-) mice, suggesting that RDH12 plays a unique, nonredundant role in the photoreceptor inner segments to regulate the flow of retinoids in the eye. Thus, severe visual impairments of individuals with null mutations in RDH12 may likely be caused by light damage(1).
15598972	Meclofenamic acid and diclofenac, novel templates of KCNQ2/Q3 potassium channel openers, depress cortical neuron activity and exhibit anticonvulsant properties.	The voltage-dependent M-type potassium current (M-current) plays a major role in controlling brain excitability by stabilizing the membrane potential and acting as a brake for neuronal firing. The KCNQ2/Q3 heteromeric channel complex was identified as the molecular correlate of the M-current. Furthermore, the KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 channel alpha subunits are mutated in families with benign familial neonatal convulsions, a neonatal form of epilepsy. Enhancement of KCNQ2/Q3 potassium currents may provide an important target for antiepileptic drug development. Here, we show that meclofenamic acid (meclofenamate) and diclofenac, two related molecules previously used as anti-inflammatory drugs, act as novel KCNQ2/Q3 channel openers. Extracellular application of meclofenamate (EC(50) = 25 microM) and diclofenac (EC(50) = 2.6 microM) resulted in the activation of KCNQ2/Q3 K(+) currents, heterologously expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Both openers activated KCNQ2/Q3 channels by causing a hyperpolarizing shift of the voltage activation curve (-23 and -15 mV, respectively) and by markedly slowing the deactivation kinetics. The effects of the drugs were stronger on KCNQ2 than on KCNQ3 channel alpha subunits. In contrast, they did not enhance KCNQ1 K(+) currents. Both openers increased KCNQ2/Q3 current amplitude at physiologically relevant potentials and led to hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential. In cultured cortical neurons, meclofenamate and diclofenac enhanced the M-current and reduced evoked and spontaneous action potentials, whereas in vivo diclofenac exhibited an anticonvulsant activity (ED(50) = 43 mg/kg). These compounds potentially constitute novel drug templates for the treatment of neuronal hyperexcitability including epilepsy, migraine, or neuropathic pain.
23581848	Design and synthesis of a tetrahydroisoquinoline-based hydroxamate derivative (ZYJ-34v), an oral active histone deacetylase inhibitor with potent antitumor activity.	In our previous study we developed a novel series of tetrahydroisoquinoline-based hydroxamic acid derivatives as histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (Bioorg. Med. Chem., 2010, 18, 1761-1772., J. Med. Chem., 2011, 54, 2823-2838.), among which compound ZYJ-34c (1) was identified and validated as the most potent one with marked in vitro and in vivo antitumor potency (J. Med. Chem., 2011, 54, 5532-5539.). Herein further modification of 1 afforded another oral active analogue ZYJ-34v (2) with simplified structure and lower molecular weight. Biological evaluation of compound 2 showed efficacious inhibition against HDAC1, 2, 3 and 6, which was confirmed by western blot analysis results. Most importantly, compound 2 exhibited similar even more potent in vitro and in vivo antitumor activities relative to the approved HDAC inhibitor SAHA This article is protected by copyright.

23569176	Minor Compensatory Changes in SAGE Mdr1a (P-gp), Bcrp, and Mrp2 Knockout Rats do not Detract from their General Utility in the Study of Transporter-mediated Pharmacokinetics.	Mdr1a-, Bcrp-, and Mrp2-knockout rats are a more practical species for ADME studies than murine models and previously demonstrated expected alterations in pharmacokinetics of various probe substrates. At present, gene expression and pathology changes were systematically studied in small intestine, liver, kidney, and brain tissue from male SAGE Mdr1a-, Bcrp-, and Mrp2-knockout rats versus wild-type Sprague Dawley controls. Gene expression data supported the relevant knockout genotype. As expected, Mrp2-knockout rats were hyperbilirubinemic and exhibited upregulation of hepatic Mrp3. Overall, few alterations were observed within 112 ADME-relevant genes. The two potentially most consequential changes were upregulation of intestinal carboxylesterase in Mdr1a-knockouts and catechol-O-methyltransferase in all tissues of Bcrp-knockout rats. Previously reported upregulation of hepatic Mdr1b P-glycoprotein in proprietary Wistar Mdr1a-knockout rats was not observed in the SAGE counterpart investigated herein. Relative liver and kidney weights were 22-53% higher in all three knockouts, with microscopic increases in hepatocyte size in Mdr1a- and Mrp2-knockout rats, and glomerular size in Bcrp- and Mrp2-knockouts. Increased relative weight of clearing organs is quantitatively consistent with reported increases in clearance of drugs that are not substrates of the knocked-out transporter. Overall, SAGE knockout rats demonstrated modest compensatory changes, which do not preclude their general application to study transporter-mediated pharmacokinetics. However, until future studies elucidate the magnitude of functional change, caution is warranted in rare instances of extensive metabolism by catechol-O-methyltransferase in Bcrp-knockouts and intestinal carboxylesterase in Mdr1a-knockout rats, specifically for molecules with free catechol groups and esters subject to gut wall hydrolysis.
10548268	Reduction of oral ethanol self-administration in rats by monoamine oxidase inhibitors.	Evidence for a role of dopamine and serotonin in the control of ethanol intake in animals suggests that monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, which increase the synaptic availability of serotonin and dopamine by blocking their metabolism, might have efficacy in the treatment of alcohol dependence. The aim of the present study was, therefore, to evaluate several MAO inhibitors for their capacity to affect ethanol self-administration in rats trained to self-administer ethanol (10% v/v) orally in a free-choice two-lever operant task. The nonselective and irreversible MAO inhibitors, phenelzine (3-10 mg/kg), tranylcypromine (1-3 mg/kg), and nialamide (30 mg/kg), decreased rates of responding maintained by ethanol reinforcement. The reversible MAO-A inhibitor, befloxatone (0.3-3 mg/kg), and the irreversible MAO-A inhibitor, clorgyline (10-30 mg/kg), also reduced ethanol self-administration. However, befloxatone-induced effects leveled off at a 50% decrease. The irreversible MAO-B inhibitors, pargyline (30 mg/kg) and l-deprenyl (3-10 mg/kg) also decreased responding maintained by ethanol reinforcement; these results are consistent with previous findings that both drugs decreased ethanol intake in mice. In conclusion, the present results showing that several MAO inhibitors decreased ethanol self-administration in rats are consistent with previous findings that synaptic levels of serotonin and dopamine play a critical role in the control of ethanol self-administration.
17573128	COX-2 in play at the AHA and the FDA.	The inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 confers a small but absolute risk of cardiovascular events on patients taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This risk has been established by placebo-controlled trials of NSAIDs selective for COX-2; traditional NSAIDs seem to be heterogeneous with respect to cardiovascular risk. The American Heart Association (AHA) has proposed a 'stepped-care' approach to the use of NSAIDs in patients with cardiovascular disease, whereas the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has failed to approve the COX-2-selective NSAID etoricoxib. In this article, these actions of the AHA and the FDA are interpreted in the light of current knowledge, prompting the formulation of scientific questions that might be addressed.
17207992	Transgenic expression of the human Vitamin D receptor (hVDR) in the duodenum of VDR-null mice attenuates the age-dependent decline in calcium absorption.	1,25(OH)(2)D(3) regulates calcium homeostasis through its actions in the intestine, bone, and kidney. These actions are mediated through the VDR. To determine if VDR's actions in the proximal small intestine can sufficiently restore calcium homeostasis, we generated transgenic mice expressing hVDR exclusively in the duodenum of mVDR-null mice by using the adenosine deaminase enhancer (hVDR+/mVDR-null). Unlike wild-type mice, hVDR+/mVDR-null mice express hVDR and VDR target genes only in the proximal small intestine. Despite having functional hVDR in the proximal small intestine, hVDR+/mVDR-null mice were hypocalcaemic when fed a normal rodent diet at weaning, like mVDR-null mice fed the same diet. The hypocalcemia in these mice is prevented if they are given the rescue diet before weaning. However, when 90-day-old rachitic mice were fed a rescue diet, serum calcium improved in hVDR+/mVDR-null mice, but not in mVDR-null mice. In conclusion, transgenic hVDR in the proximal small intestine of hVDR+/mVDR-null mice was transcriptionally active and regulated calcium absorption, but VDR actions elsewhere in the intestine are probably necessary to support adequate calcium homeostasis. In addition, hVDR+/mVDR-null mice responded better to the late rescue diet suggesting that expression of VDR in the proximal small intestine protected the calcium absorbing machinery from age-dependent decline.
15082029	Evidence that the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor plays a role in the pharmacokinetics of G-CSF and PegG-CSF using a G-CSF-R KO model.	The covalent attachment of polyethylene glycol to filgrastim results in a new molecule pegfilgrastim, which has a significantly longer half-life than filgrastim. It is likely that the clearance of both filgrastim and pegfilgrastim involves granulocyte colony simulating factor (G-CSF) receptor binding, but the pharmacokinetics of these drugs have not been compared in mice with and without a functional G-CSF receptor. We sought to clarify the role of receptor-mediated clearance of filgrastim and pegfilgrastim using wild-type (WT) mice or mice with a non-functional G-CSF-R (knockout, KO). We administered single doses of filgrastim or pegfilgrastim (10 or 100 microg kg(-1)) intravenously to WT and KO mice. Plasma levels of protein were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at preset time points, and AUC, MRT, CL, V(d), and T(1/2) were calculated. When compared with WT mice, the G-CSF-R KO mice had significantly greater AUC, longer MRT, longer T(1/2), and lower clearance. This was the case whether animals received 10 or 100 microg kg(-1) and whether they received filgrastim or pegfilgrastim. The volume of protein distribution was identical among WT and KO mice. However, the V(d) was larger after pegfilgrastim dosing than after filgrastim dosing. In both WT and KO mice, increasing the dose of figrastim or pegfilgrastim resulted in a proportional increase in the AUC. A functional G-CSF-R is an important mechanism in the plasma clearance of both filgrastim and pegfilgrastim.
11160515	Biophysical properties, pharmacology, and modulation of human, neuronal L-type (alpha(1D), Ca(V)1.3) voltage-dependent calcium currents.	Voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs) are multimeric complexes composed of a pore-forming alpha(1) subunit together with several accessory subunits, including alpha(2)delta, beta, and, in some cases, gamma subunits. A family of VDCCs known as the L-type channels are formed specifically from alpha(1S) (skeletal muscle), alpha(1C) (in heart and brain), alpha(1D) (mainly in brain, heart, and endocrine tissue), and alpha(1F) (retina). Neuroendocrine L-type currents have a significant role in the control of neurosecretion and can be inhibited by GTP-binding (G-) proteins. However, the subunit composition of the VDCCs underlying these G-protein-regulated neuroendocrine L-type currents is unknown. To investigate the biophysical and pharmacological properties and role of G-protein modulation of alpha(1D) calcium channels, we have examined calcium channel currents formed by the human neuronal L-type alpha(1D) subunit, co-expressed with alpha(2)delta-1 and beta(3a), stably expressed in a human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cell line, using whole cell and perforated patch-clamp techniques. The alpha(1D)-expressing cell line exhibited L-type currents with typical characteristics. The currents were high-voltage activated (peak at +20 mV in 20 mM Ba2+) and showed little inactivation in external Ba2+, while displaying rapid inactivation kinetics in external Ca2+. The L-type currents were inhibited by the 1,4 dihydropyridine (DHP) antagonists nifedipine and nicardipine and were enhanced by the DHP agonist BayK S-(-)8644. However, alpha(1D) L-type currents were not modulated by activation of a number of G-protein pathways. Activation of endogenous somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (sst2) by somatostatin-14 or activation of transiently transfected rat D2 dopamine receptors (rD2(long)) by quinpirole had no effect. Direct activation of G-proteins by the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue, guanosine 5'-0-(3-thiotriphospate) also had no effect on the alpha(1D) currents. In contrast, in the same system, N-type currents, formed from transiently transfected alpha(1B)/alpha(2)delta-1/beta(3), showed strong G-protein-mediated inhibition. Furthermore, the I-II loop from the alpha(1D) clone, expressed as a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion protein, did not bind Gbetagamma, unlike the alpha(1B) I-II loop fusion protein. These data show that the biophysical and pharmacological properties of recombinant human alpha(1D) L-type currents are similar to alpha(1C) currents, and these currents are also resistant to modulation by G(i/o)-linked G-protein-coupled receptors.
23531536	The Protective Effects of α-Lipoic Acid on Kidneys in Type 2 Diabetic Goto-Kakisaki Rats via Reducing Oxidative Stress.	To evaluate the protective effects of α-lipoic acid on the kidneys of Goto-Kakisaki (GK) diabetic rats, ten GK diabetic rats were randomly divided into a diabetic control group and a lipoic acid-treated diabetic group with α-lipoic acid 35 mg·Kg-1 intraperitoneal injections. Four healthy Wistar rats served as normal controls. Malonaldehyde (MDA), ascorbic acid (vitamin C), vitamin E, glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels in renal homogenate, and urine protein excretion were measured. The expression of mRNA for NF-κB, NADPH oxidase subunits p22phox and p47phox in renal tissue was examined by realtime PCR. Pathological changes in renal tissue were evaluated by light and electron microscopy. There were significant increases in urine protein excretion, MDA levels and the expression of mRNA of NF-κB, p22phox and p47phox, and significant decreases in GSH, SOD, vitamin C and vitamin E levels in the diabetic control group compared with the normal control group. Pathological changes of renal tissue were more progressive in the diabetic control group than in the normal control group. All the parameters above were improved in the α-lipoic acid-treated diabetic group. Oxidative stress is increased in the kidney of type 2 diabetic GK rats. It is associated with the progression of diabetic nephropathy. α-lipoic acid can protect renal function in diabetic rats via its antioxidant activity.
17155857	Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors as a novel approach for the treatment of respiratory disease: cilomilast.	Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) is an important cAMP-metabolising enzyme in immune and inflammatory cells, airway smooth muscle and pulmonary nerves. The phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) enzyme plays a significant role in modulating the activity of cAMP, an important second messenger that mediates the relaxation of airway smooth muscle and suppresses inflammatory cell function, thereby attenuating the inflammatory response. Selective inhibitors of this enzyme show a broad spectrum of activity in animal models of COPD and asthma. These drugs block the hydrolysis of cAMP via inhibition of PDE4 and are attractive candidates for novel anti-inflammatory drugs. At present, two second-generation PDE4 inhibitors for the treatment of COPD and asthma patients are being tested in clinical Phase III trials. The most advanced compound is the orally active, selective PDE4 inhibitor cilomilast (Ariflo, SB-207499, cis-4-cyano-4-[3-cyclopentyloxy-4-methoxyphenyl]-cyclohexanecarboxylic acid; GlaxoSmithKline). Cilomilast shows high selectivity for cAMP-specific PDE4, an isoenzyme that predominates in pro-inflammatory and immune cells and that is 10-fold more selective for PDE4D than for PDE4A, -B or -C. In vitro, cilomilast suppresses the activity of several pro-inflammatory and immune cells that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma and COPD. Moreover, it is highly active in animal models of these diseases. Cilomilast has been shown to exert potent anti-inflammatory effects both in vitro and in vivo. It is orally active and may be effective in the treatment of asthma and COPD; however, complete assessment of the therapeutic value of this novel compound class must await the outcome of longer-term clinical trials. This review presents a summary of the preclinical and clinical profile of cilomilast in patients with COPD.
23567953	Synthesis of novel 1,3,4-trisubstituted pyrazoles as anti-inflammatory and analgesic agents.	Some novel 1,3,4-trisubstituted pyrazoles were synthesized and screened for their anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities as well as their ulcerogenic liability. They showed anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities with better GIT tolerance than the standard drug phenylbutazone. In addition, IC50 values for 5e and 8e were recorded. Compound 5e was found to be the most active one as anti-inflammatory and analgesic agent. On the other hand, COX-1/COX-2 isozyme selectivity was also done which showed equal inhibition to both isoforms.
12751792	Testis-specific expression of the nuclear form of phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx).	The selenoprotein phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx) is present in at least three different isoforms in testis: as a cytosolic, as a mitochondrial, and as a nuclear protein. We have recently shown that a sperm nucleus-specific glutathione peroxidase (snGPx) is identical to the mitochondrial and cytosolic forms of PHGPx apart from its N-terminus. This arginine-rich N-terminus of snGPx, reminiscent of protamines, is encoded by an alternative exon located in the first intron of the PHGPx gene and is responsible for nuclear localisation and chromatin binding of snGPx [Pfeifer et al., FASEB J. 15 (2001), pp. 1236-1238]. By using a combination of techniques including selective cloning of mRNA 5'-ends, RT-PCR, and S1 analyses, we provide evidence that the transcript encoding the nuclear form is generated by transcription initiation at an alternative promoter and not by alternative splicing. We show that the major transcription start region is located at -12 to -14 upstream of the AUG translation initiation site of the sperm nucleus-specific exon and lacks a TATA box. Two minor TATA-less transcription initiation sites are located at around -30 and -45. We have shown by in situ hybridisation that snGPx expression in testis, like protamine expression, is restricted to late stages of spermatogenesis whereas PHGPx expression is only found in spermatocytes and early spermatids. These findings have to be taken into account when studying either the differential regulation of PHGPx and snGPx expression in testis or the impact of putative mutations in snGPx on male fertility in man.
9570468	Cataleptogenic effect of subtype selective 5-HT receptor antagonists in the rat.	5-HT receptor antagonists with selectivity for 5-HT1A WAY-100635 (N-[2-[-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl)cyclohe xanecarboxamide), 5-HT1B GR 127935 (N-[methoxy-3-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)phenyl]-2'-methyl-4'(5-methyl-1,2, 4-oxadiazol-3-yl)[1,1-biphenyl]-4-carboxamide x HCl), 5-HT2C SB 200646A (N-(1-methyl-5-indolyl)-N'-(3-pyridyl)urea x HCl) and 5-HT2A (ketanserin, fananserin and MDL 100,151 ((+/-)-alpha-(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-[2-(4-fluorophenyl)ethyl]-4-pipe ridinemethanol) receptors were tested for cataleptogenic responses in rats. WAY-100635 (0.1-3 mg/kg, s.c.), ketanserin (0.1-3 mg/kg, s.c.), MDL 100,151 (0.3-3 mg/kg, s.c.) and fananserin (RP 62203; 3 mg/kg, s.c.) induced a significant catalepsy. GR 127935 (1 mg/kg, s.c.), SB 200646A (without effect per se at 10 mg/kg, s.c.) and MDL 100,151 (0.3 mg/kg, s.c.) did not inhibit the cataleptic response to the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, loxapine (0.3 mg/kg, s.c.). Catalepsy induced by MDL 100,151 (3 mg/kg) was blocked by co-treatment with clozapine, but not by SB 200646A (both at 10 mg/kg, s.c.). Although clozapine displays significant affinity to 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors, the present results suggest that blockade of these receptors is not responsible for clozapine's anticataleptic activity.
17510490	Segmental and complementary expression of L-serine biosynthetic enzyme 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase and neutral amino acid transporter ASCT1 in the mouse kidney.	3-Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (Phgdh) is the initial step enzyme in the phosphorylated pathway of L-serine biosynthesis. We have previously revealed in the brain that Phgdh is preferentially expressed in glial cells, but not in neurons, and that glia-borne L-serine exerts strong neurotrophic actions to neuronal survive, differentiation, and development. To investigate whether such an L-serine-meditated intercellular relationship is constructed in peripheral organs and tissues, we examined the kidney, which is one of the organs with the highest expression of Phgdh mRNA in the body. We found that Phgdh was distributed highly in the renal papilla and inner layer of the outer zone and moderately in the cortex, whereas it was almost negative in the outer layer of the outer zone. This heterogeneous distribution was due to selective expression in distinct tubular segments, i.e., the Bowman's capsule, proximal tubule, and thin limbs of the Henle's loop. Interestingly, neutral amino acid transporter ASCT1, which preferentially transports alanine, serine, cysteine, and threonine, was selectively expressed in Phgdh-negative tubular segments, i.e., the distal tubule and collecting duct. Therefore, either Phgdh or ASCT1 is provided to each segment of renal tubules, suggesting that metabolic interplay mediated by L-serine biosynthesis and supply may exist in the kidney too.
23061466	Human ether-a-go-go-related gene channel blockers and its structural analysis for drug design.	The human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) is a K+ channel protein mainly expressed in the heart and the nervous systems and its blockade by non-cardiovascular acting drugs resulted in tachycardia and sudden death. In this present review, we have focused the physicochemical properties responsible for the hERG blocking activity of structurally different compounds. The reported research works showed that the hydrophobicity on the van der Waals (vdW) surface of the molecules (aroused from the aromatic ring) necessary for the hERG blocking activity along with topological and electronic properties. The quinolizidine alkaloids (natural products) such as oxymatrine, sophoridine, sophocarpine and matrine carry the common molecular structure of O=C=N-C-C-C-N that possessed positive ionotropic effect and hERG blocking activity. Acehytisine hydrochloride (previously named Guangfu base A) was isolated from the root of Aconitum coreanum (Levl.), is an anti-arrhythmic drug in phase IV clinical trial. The isoquinoline alkaloid, neferine (Nef) induces a concentration-dependent decrease in current amplitude (IC50 of 7.419 MM). Most of these natural product compounds contain non-flexible aromatic structures but have significant activity due to the presence of optimum hydrophobicity. Recent research works revealed that Eag and hERG channels are expressed by a variety of cancer cell lines and tissues. The Eag channel showed an oncogenic potential while hERG channels are associated with more aggressive tumors and have a role in mediating invasion. This review concluded that the consideration of physicochemical properties necessary for the hERG blocking activity will guide to develop novel drugs with less cardiotoxicity.
23542819	The ethylene bis-dithiocarbamate fungicide Mancozeb activates voltage-gated KCNQ2 potassium channel.	Mancozeb (manganese/zinc ethylene bis-dithiocarbamate) is an organometallic fungicide that has been associated with human neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration. In a high-throughput screen for modulators of KCNQ2 channel, a fundamental player modulating neuronal excitability, Mancozeb, was found to significantly potentiate KCNQ2 activity. Mancozeb was validated electrophysiologically as a KCNQ2 activator with an EC50 value of 0.92±0.23μM. Further examination showed that manganese but not zinc ethylene bis-dithiocarbamate is the active component for the positive modulation effects. In addition, the compounds are effective when the metal ions are substituted by iron but lack potentiation activity when the metal ions are substituted by sodium, signifying the importance of the metal ion. However, the iron (Fe(3+)) alone, organic ligands alone or the mixture of iron with the organic ligand did not show any potentiation effect, suggesting as the active ingredient is a specific complex rather than two separate additive or synergistic components. Our study suggests that potentiation on KCNQ2 potassium channels might be the possible mechanism of Mancozeb toxicity in the nervous system.
19519385	Pyridinium oximes as cholinesterase reactivators. Structure-activity relationship and efficacy in the treatment of poisoning with organophosphorus compounds.	During more than five decades, pyridinium oximes have been developed as therapeutic agents used in the medical treatment of poisoning with organophosphorus compounds. Their mechanism of action is reactivation of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibited by organophosphorus agents. Organophosphorus compounds (OPC) are used as pesticides and developed as warfare nerve agents such as tabun, soman, sarin, VX and others. Exposure to even small amounts of an OPC can be fatal and death is usually caused by respiratory failure resulting from paralysis of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles, depression of the brain respiratory center, bronchospasm, and excessive bronchial secretions. The mechanism of OPC poisoning involves phosphorylation of the serine hydroxyl group at the active site of AChE leading to the inactivation of this essential enzyme, which has an important role in neurotransmission. AChE inhibition results in the accumulation of acetylcholine at cholinergic receptor sites, producing continuous stimulation of cholinergic fibers throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. Presently, a combination of an antimuscarinic agent, e.g. atropine, AChE reactivator such as one of the standard pyridinium oximes (pralidoxime, trimedoxime, obidoxime, HI-6) and diazepam has been used for the treatment of organophosphate poisoning in humans. Despite enormous efforts devoted to synthesis and development of new pyridinium oximes as potential antidotes against poisoning with OPC, only four compounds have found their application in human medicine so far. However, they differ in their activity in poisoning with warfare nerve agents and pesticides and there is still no universal broad-spectrum oxime capable of protecting against all known OPC. In this article, we review data on structure-activity relationship of pyridinium oximes and discuss their pharmacological and toxicological significance.
23122081	Physicochemical parameters that influence carotenoids bioaccessibility from a tomato juice.	In vitro digestion models have been developed to estimate carotenoid bioavailability but most do not consider that their diffusion from fruit matrix to the lipid phase of the bolus could be a limiting step. Therefore we designed a model in which tomato juice is mixed with oil or oil/water emulsions, and the carotenoids diffusing to oil are measured by spectrometry. Temperature, pH and tomato juice/peanut oil ratio were evaluated for their influence on carotenoid diffusion. When oil/tomato ratio was between 0.11 and 1, extraction of lycopene was limited by the saturation of the oil phase. With a large excess of oil, diffusion was also limited, as only 31 ± 1% of lycopene could be extracted from the juice. Diffusion did not vary significantly with pH but doubled when temperature rose from 10°C to 37°C. When the juice was mixed in an emulsion stabilised with bovine serum albumin or phospholipids the maximum extraction decreased to 14.5 ± 0.2% and 18.5 ± 1.5% respectively, indicating that in addition to the saturation of the oil phase at low oil/tomato ratio and in addition to intrinsic properties of the tomato juice in non-saturating conditions, lycopene diffusion was limited by the structure of the interface in emulsions.
23266503	Effects of baicalein on apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, migration and invasion of osteosarcoma cells.	Baicalein is a bioactive flavonoid that is widely used in ancient China. However, its effects on the most common primary malignant bone tumor, osteosarcoma, remain unknown. In the present study, we investigated the effects of baicalein in osteosarcoma cells. Our results indicate baicalein might be an efficacious anti-osteosarcoma drug. We found that baicalein could inhibit cell proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Additionally, we demonstrated that baicalein promotes osteosarcoma cell apoptosis, and our mechanistic studies suggest that this is mediated by caspase activation, especially caspase-3. We also showed that the down-regulation of Bcl-2 and concurrent increase in Bax and Bim levels contribute to the apoptosis induced by baicalein. In addition, we observed that baicalein induces G1 cell cycle arrest by decreasing cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4). Furthermore, our data verifies that baicalein can reduce osteosarcoma cell adhesion, migration and invasion in vitro, which indicates its potential to inhibit osteosarcoma metastasis. The decrease in expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 may contribute to the effects of baicalein. Taken together, our results provide evidence that baicalein plays important roles in anti-osteosarcoma therapy, and thus may serve as a novel and efficient candidate agent for osteosarcoma treatment.
11783365	[Effects of mifepristone on expression of estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor in cultured human eutopic and ectopic endometria].	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of mifepristone on expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) in cultured human eutopic and ectopic endometria. METHODS: Endometrial (n = 22) and endometriotic (n = 12) tissues, obtained from patients with endometriosis, were cultured with and without mifepristone (1 x 10(-6) mol/L, 1 x 10(-4) mol/L) for 7-10 days. The expressions of ER, PR were determined by semi-quantitative immunocytochemistry method. Thirteen normal endometrial samples served as controls. RESULTS: The expressions of ER and PR in normal and eutopic endometrial cells showed the same cyclic pattern. The only difference was the significantly higher PR glandular content in eutopic endometria of endometriosis patients, as compared with normal controls [histochemistry score (H-score) 2.77 +/- 0.32 Vs 2.20 +/- 0.26 P < 0.05]. On the contrary, the ER, PR expressions in ectopic endometrial cells were significantly lower only during the proliferative phase (ER: gland 0.65-2.17 Vs 1.50-3.23, stroma 0.45-1.03 Vs 0.80-1.96; PR: gland 0.55-1.77 Vs 1.55-3.34, stroma 0.40-1.27 Vs 0.98-2.50; P < 0.05-0.01); significantly higher only during the late secretory phase (ER: gland 3.27 +/- 0.31 Vs 0.28 +/- 0.11, stroma 1.87 +/- 0.31 Vs 0.26 +/- 0.15; PR: gland 3.33 +/- 0.23 Vs 0.36 +/- 0.23) as compared with those of eutopic endometria. 10(-6)-10(-4) mol/L of mifepristone significantly suppressed the expressions of ER, PR in both eutopic and ectopic endometrial cells of endometriosis patients (P < 0.01) in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of ER, PR of endometriotic cells differed significantly from that of endometrial cells of patients with or without endometriosis. The down-regulatory effect on ER and PR may be one of the therapeutic mechanism of mifepristone on endometriosis.
11728565	Insulinotropic meglitinide analogues.	The loss of early-phase insulin secretion is an important and early event in the natural history of type 2 diabetes. Because a normal pattern of insulin secretion is essential for the effective control of postprandial metabolism, a rational basis for the development of agents that target early-phase insulin release exists. Conventional oral hypoglycaemic agents do not target, or adequately control, postprandial glycaemia. The emergence of new classes of oral agent with a more specific mode of action provides, for the first time, an opportunity to restore early-phase insulin release. One such drug class is the meglitinide analogues (repaglinide, nateglinide, and mitiglinide). These drugs are ideally suited for combination use with metformin. They could also prove effective in combination with a thiazolidinedione, a drug class that targets insulin resistance. Exogenous insulin is frequently required in the late management of type 2 diabetes. However, one hope for newer combinations of diabetic drugs is that the functional life of the beta cell can be extended, thereby delaying the need for insulin injections.
17463174	Real-time PCR determination of IMPDH1 and IMPDH2 expression in blood cells.	BACKGROUND: Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in de novo guanine nucleotide synthesis and is implicated in cell cycle control. Inhibition of this enzyme is associated with immunosuppressive, antiviral, and antitumor activity. IMPDH basal activity increases after initiation of immunosuppressive therapy. METHODS: A real-time reverse-transcription PCR assay was developed and validated for mRNA quantification of the 2 human IMPDH isoforms. Target gene expressions were normalized to the geometric mean of 3 housekeeping genes. Assay utility was tested by analyzing patient samples and cultured cells exposed to immunosuppressive drugs such as the IMPDH inhibitor mycophenolic acid. RESULTS: The assay was linear over 6 logs of cDNA input and demonstrated specific quantification of IMPDH1 and IMPDH2 expression in cultured cells and patient samples. Limits of detection and quantification were 10 and 10(3) copies of cDNA per reaction, respectively. Within-run and total between-day CVs were <15% for normalized expression. Changes in IMPDH1 and 2 expression were observed in patient samples after initiation of an immunosuppressive regimen that included calcineurin inhibitors, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroids. CONCLUSIONS: This assay can be used to study the regulation of IMPDH expression and the involvement of the enzymes in immunological and malignant proliferative conditions. This may contribute to the processes of drug development and to the establishment of monitoring strategies for treatment effect and disease activity.
23499825	Steroidal glycosides from the bulbs of Fritillaria meleagris and their cytotoxic activities.	Steroidal glycosides (1-18), including 10 new compounds (1-10), were isolated from the bulbs of Fritillaria meleagris (Liliaceae). The structures of the new compounds were determined by two-dimensional (2D) NMR analysis, and by hydrolytic cleavage followed by spectroscopic and chromatographic analysis. The isolated compounds and their aglycones were evaluated for cytotoxic activity against HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells and A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells. Morphological observation and flow cytometry analysis showed that 5β-spirostanol glycoside (2) and a cholestane derivative (17a) induced apoptotic cell death in HL-60 cells through different mechanisms of action. Furthermore, the (22R)-spirosolanol glycoside (11) selectively induced apoptosis in A549 cells without affecting the caspase-3 activity level.
16322797	GPR109A (PUMA-G/HM74A) mediates nicotinic acid-induced flushing.	Nicotinic acid (niacin) has long been used as an antidyslipidemic drug. Its special profile of actions, especially the rise in HDL-cholesterol levels induced by nicotinic acid, is unique among the currently available pharmacological tools to treat lipid disorders. Recently, a G-protein-coupled receptor, termed GPR109A (HM74A in humans, PUMA-G in mice), was described and shown to mediate the nicotinic acid-induced antilipolytic effects in adipocytes. One of the major problems of the pharmacotherapeutical use of nicotinic acid is a strong flushing response. This side effect, although harmless, strongly affects patient compliance. In the present study, we show that mice lacking PUMA-G did not show nicotinic acid-induced flushing. In addition, flushing in response to nicotinic acid was also abrogated in the absence of cyclooxygenase type 1, and mice lacking prostaglandin D(2) (PGD(2)) and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) receptors had reduced flushing responses. The mouse orthologue of GPR109A, PUMA-G, is highly expressed in macrophages and other immune cells, and transplantation of wild-type bone marrow into irradiated PUMA-G-deficient mice restored the nicotinic acid-induced flushing response. Our data clearly indicate that GPR109A mediates nicotinic acid-induced flushing and that this effect involves release of PGE(2) and PGD(2), most likely from immune cells of the skin.
23429274	Cyclic stretch induces inducible nitric oxide synthase and soluble guanylate cyclase in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells.	In the pulmonary vasculature, mechanical forces such as cyclic stretch induce changes in vascular signaling, tone and remodeling. Nitric oxide is a potent regulator of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), which drives cGMP production, causing vasorelaxation. Pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) express inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and while iNOS expression increases during late gestation, little is known about how cyclic stretch impacts this pathway. In this study, PASMC were subjected to cyclic stretch of 20% amplitude and frequency of 1 Hz for 24 h and compared to control cells maintained under static conditions. Cyclic stretch significantly increased cytosolic oxidative stress as compared to static cells (62.9 ± 5.9% vs. 33.3 ± 5.7% maximal oxidation), as measured by the intracellular redox sensor roGFP. Cyclic stretch also increased sGCβ protein expression (2.5 ± 0.9-fold), sGC activity (1.5 ± 0.2-fold) and cGMP levels (1.8 ± 0.2-fold), as well as iNOS mRNA and protein expression (3.0 ± 0.9 and 2.6 ± 0.7-fold, respectively) relative to control cells. An antioxidant, recombinant human superoxide dismutase (rhSOD), significantly decreased stretch-induced cytosolic oxidative stress, but did not block stretch-induced sGC activity. Inhibition of iNOS with 1400 W or an iNOS-specific siRNA inhibited stretch-induced sGC activity by 30% and 68% respectively vs. static controls. In conclusion, cyclic stretch increases sGC expression and activity in an iNOS-dependent manner in PASMC from fetal lambs. The mechanism that produces iNOS and sGC upregulation is not yet known, but we speculate these effects represent an early compensatory mechanism to counteract the effects of stretch-induced oxidative stress. A better understanding of the interplay between these two distinct pathways could provide key insights into future avenues to treat infants with pulmonary hypertension.
9525969	Differential interaction of coagulation factor VIII and factor V with protein chaperones calnexin and calreticulin.	Factor VIII (FVIII) and factor V (FV) are homologous coagulation cofactors sharing a similar domain organization (A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2) and are both extensively glycosylated within their B-domains. In mammalian cell expression systems, compared with FV, the FVIII primary translation product is inefficiently transported out of the endoplasmic reticulum. Here we show that FVIII is degraded within the cell by a lactacystin-inhibitable pathway, implicating the cytosolic 20 S proteasome machinery. Protein chaperones calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT) preferentially interact with glycoproteins containing monoglucosylated N-linked oligosaccharides and are proposed to traffic proteins through degradative and/or secretory pathways. Utilizing co-immunoprecipitation assays, intracellular FVIII was detected in association with CNX maximally within 30 min to 1 h following synthesis, whereas FV could not be detected in association with CNX. In contrast, both FVIII and FV displayed interaction with CRT during transit through the secretory pathway. B-domain deleted FVIII significantly reduced the CNX and CRT interaction, indicating the B-domain may represent a primary CNX and CRT interaction site. In the presence of inhibitors of glucose trimming, the interactions of FVIII with CNX, and of FVIII and FV with CRT, were significantly reduced whereas the secretion of FVIII, and not FV, was inhibited. In addition, transfection in a glucosidase I-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cell line (Lec23) demonstrated that both degradation and secretion of FVIII were inhibited, with little effect on the secretion of FV. These results support that CNX and CRT binding, mediated at least in part by the B-domain of FVIII, is required for efficient FVIII degradation and secretion. In contrast, FV does not require CNX interaction for efficient secretion. The results suggest a unique requirement for carbohydrate processing and molecular chaperone interactions that may limit the productive secretion of FVIII.
23473804	Absence of correlation between oxysterol accumulation in lipid raft microdomains, calcium increase, and apoptosis induction on 158N murine oligodendrocytes.	There is some evidence that oxidized derivatives of cholesterol, 7-ketocholesterol (7KC) and 7β-hydroxycholesterol (7βOHC), are increased in the plasma of patients with neurodegenerative diseases associated with demyelinization of the central nervous system (CNS). It was therefore of interest to investigate the effects of these oxysterols on oligodendrocytes, the myelin-forming cells in the CNS. To this end, 158N murine oligodendrocytes were treated with 7KC or 7βOHC inducing an apoptotic mode of cell death characterized by condensation/fragmentation of the nuclei, dephosphorylation of Akt and GSK3, mitochondrial depolarization involving Mcl-1, and caspase-3 activation. In contrast, under treatment with 27-hydroxycholesterol (27OHC), no cell death was observed. When the cells were stained with Fura-2, no significant Ca(2+) rise was found with the different oxysterols, whereas strong signals were detected with ionomycin used as positive control. At concentrations which induced apoptosis, 7KC but not 7βOHC accumulated in lipid rafts. Although not cytotoxic, 27OHC was mainly detected in lipid rafts. It is noteworthy that α-tocopherol (but not ellagic acid and resveratrol) was able to counteract 7KC- and 7βOHC-induced apoptosis and to decrease the accumulation of 7KC and 27OHC in lipid rafts. Thus, in 158N cells, the ability of oxysterols to trigger a mode of cell death by apoptosis involving GSK-3 and caspase-3 activation is independent of the increase in the Ca(2+) level and of their accumulation in lipid raft microdomains.
23515291	Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 2 (IGFBP-2) Promotes Growth and Survival of Breast Epithelial Cells: Novel Regulation of the Estrogen Receptor.	In breast tumors IGF binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2) is elevated, and the presence of IGFBP-2 has been shown to correlate with malignancy. However, how IGFBP-2 contributes to the malignant state is still unclear. Silencing IGFBP-2 blocked cell proliferation and in MCF-7 cells increased cell death, indicating that IGFBP-2 was acting in both a mitogenic and a survival capacity. Exogenous IGFBP-2 acting via integrin receptors to reduce phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 10 (PTEN) levels protected these cells against death induced by various chemotherapeutic agents. This was dependent on a functional estrogen receptor (ER)-α because silencing ER-α blocked the ability of IGFBP-2 to confer cell survival. Loss of IGFBP-2 increased levels of PTEN and improved chemosensitivity of the cells, confirming its role as a survival factor. Silencing IGFBP-2 had no effect on the response to IGF-II, but responses to estrogen and tamoxifen were no longer observed due to loss of ER-α, which could be prevented by the inhibition of PTEN. Conversely, exogenous IGFBP-2 increased ER-α mRNA and protein in both normal and cancer cells via its interaction with integrin receptors. These actions of IGFBP-2 on ER-α involved the IGF-I receptor and activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in the cancer cells but were independent of this in normal breast cells. The production of IGFBP-2 by breast cancer cells enhances their proliferative potential, increases their survival, and protects them against chemotherapy-induced death. IGFBP-2 not only modulates IGFs and directly regulates PTEN but also has a role in maintaining ER-α expression.
12837382	Rational design of alkylene-linked bis-pyridiniumaldoximes as improved acetylcholinesterase reactivators.	To improve the potency of 2-pralidoxime (2-PAM) for treating organophosphate poisoning, we dimerized 2-PAM and its analogs according to Wilson's pioneering work and the 3D structure of human acetylcholinesterase (hAChE) inactivated by isoflurophate. 1,7-Heptylene-bis-N,N'-syn-2-pyridiniumaldoxime, the most potent of the alkylene-linked dimeric reactivators, was readily synthesized using bistriflate and is 100 times more potent than 2-PAM in reactivating hAChE poisoned by isoflurophate. Experimental and computational studies confirm that 2-PAM in its biologically active form adopts the syn-I configuration. Further, they suggest that the improved performance of dimeric oximes is conferred by two-site binding with one oxime pointing toward the diisopropyl ester at the catalytic site of hAChE and the other anchored at the peripheral site. This type of binding may induce a conformational change in the acyl pocket loop which modulates the catalytic site via a domino effect.
8622623	5-Carboxamido-tryptamine, CP-122,288 and dihydroergotamine but not sumatriptan, CP-93,129, and serotonin-5-O-carboxymethyl-glycyl -tyrosinamide block dural plasma protein extravasation in knockout mice that lack 5-hydroxytryptamine1B receptors.	We studied the dural plasma protein extravasation response after unilateral electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion in mice lacking serotonin 5-HT1B (5-HT1D beta) receptors by modifying a technique previously described in rats or guinea pigs. We investigated the inhibitory effects of six 5-HT1 receptor agonists in this model: 3-(1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyrid-4-yl)pyrrolo[3,2-b]pyrid-5-one (CP-93,129), sumatriptan, serotonin-5-O-carboxymethyl-glycyl -tyrosinamide (GTI), 5-methylaminosulfonylmethyl-3-(N-methylpyrrolidin-2R -ylmethyl)-1H-indole (CP-122,288), 5-carboxamido-tryptamine (5-CT), and dihydroergotamine. The plasma extravasation response did not differ between wild-type and mutant after vehicle injection. The potency of sumatriptan, CP-122,288, CP-93,129, and 5-CT in wild-type mice was similar to that previously reported for rats. CP-122,288 (1 nmol kg), 5-CT (1 nmol/kg), and dihydroergotamine (72 nmol/kg) inhibited plasma protein extravasation within dura mater after electrical trigeminal ganglion stimulation in both wild-type and knockout mice, which suggests that these agonists act predominantly via receptors other than 5-HT1B. Unlike the wild-type mice, CP-93,129 (1.4 mumol/kg), a specific 5-HT1B receptor agonist, had no effect in knockout mice. The same held true for sumatriptan (0.7 mumol/kg) and GTI (0.6 mumol/kg). These results suggest that CP-93,129, sumatriptan, and GTI exert their effects via 5-HT1B (5-HT1D beta) receptors in mice.
1705633	Clinical pharmacology of enalkiren, a novel, dipeptide renin inhibitor.	Enalkiren (A-64662), a potent, dipeptide renin inhibitor, mimics the transition state of the human renin substrate, angiotensinogen. Enalkiren has been shown to produce dose-related suppression of plasma renin activity (PRA) and angiotensin II when administered intravenously. Doses of enalkiren of less than 0.1 mg/kg induced little hemodynamic response in normotensive and hypertensive volunteers despite marked suppression of PRA. However, at doses of 0.3 and 1.2 mg/kg, enalkiren produced significant, dose-related decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive patients, and the BP response was enhanced by pretreatment with hydrochlorothiazide. The effects of enalkiren on PRA and BP are prolonged despite its relatively short elimination phase plasma half-life (1.6 h). Persistent pharmacologic activity without evidence of tachyphylaxis was demonstrated during 1 week of treatment in hypertensive patients. The observed dissociation between suppression of PRA and BP response and the recruitment of dose-related BP decrements, despite complete suppression of PRA, are unexplained phenomena. The results of clinical trials with enalkiren are encouraging, and suggest that renin inhibitors may be safe, useful therapeutic agents in the management of hypertension.
23154533	The onset of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis immediately after methimazole was switched to propylthiouracil in a woman with Graves' disease who wished to become pregnant.	Propylthiouracil (PTU) is recommended as a first-line antithyroid drug (ATD) during first trimester organogenesis in pregnancy because recent evidence suggests that methimazole (MMI) may be associated with congenital anomalies. However, PTU more commonly causes myeloperoxidase (MPO)-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, which usually occurs during prolonged treatment, compared with MMI. We report a case of MPO-ANCA-associated vasculitis in a 35-year-old woman with Graves'disease. Although her thyroid function could be maintained euthyroid by MMI, her ATD was switched to PTU because she wished to become pregnant. The patient presented with flu-like symptoms 8 days after starting PTU and developed hemoptysis and dyspnea at 22 days. Her MPO-ANCA titer was 21 ELISA units (EUs) before PTU treatment but increased to 259 EUs at 22 days after PTU treatment. Her clinical condition improved with the discontinuation of PTU and with immunosuppressive therapy. This case indicated that MPO-ANCA vasculitis occurred within several weeks after the initiation of PTU and that this side effect could be caused by the change from MMI to PTU. Thus, our clinical observation suggests that patients treated with PTU should be carefully monitored for MPO-ANCA titers and variable manifestations of MPO-ANCA-associated vasculitis regardless of the period of administration.
23434223	A one-pot domino synthesis and discovery of highly functionalized dihydrobenzo[b]thiophenes as AChE inhibitors.	A library of novel 5-amino-2,7-diaryl-2,3-dihydrobenzo[b]thiophene-4,6-dicarbonitriles have been synthesized regioselectively in good yields through the one-pot domino reactions of 5-aryldihydro-3(2H)-thiophenones, malononitrile and aromatic aldehydes in the presence of morpholine. This transformation presumably involves Knoevenagel condensation-Michael addition-intramolecular Thorpe-Ziegler cyclization-Tautomerization-Elimination sequence of reactions. These compounds were evaluated for their acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity and 5-amino-2,7-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-2,3-dihydrobenzo[b]thiophene-4,6-dicarbonitrile was found to be the most potent against AChE with IC50 4.16 μmol/L.
17088426	PGE(1) stimulation of HEK293 cells generates multiple contiguous domains with different [cAMP]: role of compartmentalized phosphodiesterases.	There is a growing appreciation that the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway is organized to form transduction units that function to deliver specific messages. Such organization results in the local activation of PKA subsets through the generation of confined intracellular gradients of cAMP, but the mechanisms responsible for limiting the diffusion of cAMP largely remain to be clarified. In this study, by performing real-time imaging of cAMP, we show that prostaglandin 1 stimulation generates multiple contiguous, intracellular domains with different cAMP concentration in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. By using pharmacological and genetic manipulation of phosphodiesterases (PDEs), we demonstrate that compartmentalized PDE4B and PDE4D are responsible for selectively modulating the concentration of cAMP in individual subcellular compartments. We propose a model whereby compartmentalized PDEs, rather than representing an enzymatic barrier to cAMP diffusion, act as a sink to drain the second messenger from discrete locations, resulting in multiple and simultaneous domains with different cAMP concentrations irrespective of their distance from the site of cAMP synthesis.
22902323	High levels of arachidonic acid and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha in breast cancer tissues are associated with promoting cancer cell proliferation.	Fatty acids are endogenous ligands of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARα), which is linked to the regulation of fatty acid uptake, lipid metabolism and breast cancer cell growth. This study was designed to screen candidate fatty acids from breast cancer tissue and to investigate the effects of these candidate fatty acids on PPARα expression, cell growth and cell cycle progression in breast cancer cell lines. One breast cancer tissue and one reference tissue were each taken from 30 individual breasts to examine for fatty acid composition and PPARα expression. The cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 (ER-), MCF-7 (ER++++) and BT-474 (ER++) were used to explore the mechanisms regulating cell proliferation. We found that arachidonic acid (AA) and PPARα were highly expressed in the breast cancer tissues. AA stimulated the growth of all three breast cancer cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The growth stimulatory effect of AA was associated with PPARα activation, and the most potent effect was found in MCF-7 cells. The stimulation of cell proliferation by AA was accompanied by the increased expression of cyclin E, a reduced population of G1 phase cells, and a faster G1/S phase transition. In contrast, AA had no effects on the levels of CDK2, CDK4, cyclin D1, p27, Bcl-2 and Bax. Our results demonstrate that high levels of AA and PPARα expression in human breast cancer tissues are associated with ER-overexpressed breast cancer cell proliferation, which is involved in activating PPARα, stimulating cyclin E expression, and promoting faster G1/S transition.
23318731	Oxidative and nitrosative stress and apoptosis in oral mucosa cells after ex vivo exposure to lead and benzo[a]pyrene.	Exposure of human oral mucosa to lead (Pb) and benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) by inhalation and ingestion can lead to pathological conditions via apoptosis and oxidative and nitrosative stress. However, few studies have investigated the effects of Pb and BaP on oral mucosa cells. Furthermore, previous studies focused on chronic Pb and BaP exposure. Therefore, we evaluated important markers of apoptosis and oxidative and nitrosative stress in oral mucosa cells by incubating the cells with Pb and BaP for 5-360 min. Ex vivo samples of human oral mucosa were exposed to Pb or BaP, and immunohistochemical staining was performed to evaluate active caspase-3, 8-epi-prostaglandin F2 alpha (8-epi-PGF2a), and 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT). Pb and BaP treatments significantly increased active caspase-3 levels in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, the treatments induced an early increase in 3-NT level, which ceased with longer incubation times. 8-Epi-PGF2a level increased only after prolonged incubation with Pb, and this elevation was irrespective of BaP incubation duration. Smokers' samples had significantly lower levels of markers of oxidative and nitrosative stress than did nonsmokers' samples. Thus, single, short-term exposure to Pb or BaP increases the levels of apoptosis markers and markers of oxidative and nitrosative stress.
17251323	Glucocorticoids stimulate ENaC upregulation in bovine mammary epithelium.	Mammary epithelia produce an isotonic, low-Na(+) fluid that is rich in nutrients. Mechanisms that account for the low electrolyte concentration have not been elucidated, although amiloride-sensitive ion transport has been reported in some situations. We hypothesized that corticosteroid exposure modulates epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC) expression and/or activity in bovine mammary epithelial cells. BME-UV cells were grown to confluent monolayers on permeable supports with a standard basolateral medium and apical medium of low-electrolyte, high-lactose composition that resembles the ionic composition of milk. Ion transport was assessed in modified Ussing flux chambers. Exposure to glucocorticoids (dexamethasone, cortisol, or prednisolone), but not aldosterone, increased short-circuit current (I(sc)), a sensitive measure of net ion transport, whereas apical exposure to amiloride or benzamil reduced corticosteroid-induced I(sc) close to basal levels. Quantitative RT-PCR indicated a glucocorticoid-induced increase in mRNA for beta- and gamma-ENaC, whereas alpha-ENaC mRNA expression was only mildly affected. Exposure to mifepristone (a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist), but not spironolactone (a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist), precluded both the corticosteroid-induced elevation in amiloride-sensitive I(sc) and the induced changes in beta- and gamma-ENaC mRNA. We conclude that Na(+) movement across mammary epithelia is modulated by corticosteroids via a glucocorticoid receptor-mediated mechanism that regulates the expression of the beta- and gamma-subunits of ENaC. ENaC expression and activity could account for the low Na(+) concentration that is typical of milk.
23377617	Decreased zinc availability affects glutathione metabolism in neuronal cells and in the developing brain.	A deficit in zinc (Zn) availability can increase cell oxidant production, affect the antioxidant defense system, and trigger oxidant-sensitive signals in neuronal cells. This work tested the hypothesis that a decreased Zn availability can affect glutathione (GSH) metabolism in the developing rat brain and in neuronal cells in culture, as well as the capacity of human neuroblastoma IMR-32 cells to upregulate GSH when challenged with dopamine (DA). GSH levels were low in the brain of gestation day 19 (GD19) fetuses from dams fed marginal Zn diets throughout gestation and in Zn-deficient IMR-32 cells. γ-Glutamylcysteine synthetase (GCL), the first enzyme in the GSH synthetic pathway, was altered by Zn deficiency (ZD). The protein and mRNA levels of the GCL modifier (GCLM) and catalytic (GCLC) subunits were lower in the Zn-deficient GD19 fetal brain and in IMR-32 cells compared with controls. The nuclear translocation of transcription factor nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2, which controls GCL transcription, was impaired by ZD. Posttranslationally, the caspase-3-dependent GCLC cleavage was high in Zn-deficient IMR-32 cells. Cells challenged with DA showed an increase in GCLM and GCLC protein and mRNA levels and a consequent increase in GSH concentration. Although Zn-deficient cells partially upregulated GCL subunits after exposure to DA, GSH content remained low. In summary, results show that a low Zn availability affects the GSH synthetic pathway in neuronal cells and fetal brain both at transcriptional and posttranslational levels. This can in part underlie the GSH depletion associated with ZD and the high sensitivity of Zn-deficient neurons to pro-oxidative stressors.
23500772	Activation of ALDH2 with ethanol attenuates diabetes induced myocardial injury in rats.	This study assessed changes in myocardial ALDH2 expression in the diabetic rat, in particular the diabetic rat pretreated with ALDH2 activator ethanol (EtOH). The rats were divided into six groups: control, EtOH control, diabetic rat at 4th week (DM4W), 8th week (DM8W), 12th week (DM12W) and EtOH+DM8W groups. Compared with control group, fasting blood glucose (FBG) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were increased in DM groups. HbA1c level in DM12W group was higher than in DM4W group, HbA1c level in EtOH+DM8W group was lower than in DM8W group. Compared with control group, there were no changes of LVDP, HR and ±dp/dtmax in DM4W group, but there were decreased in DM8W and DM12W groups, and increased in the EtOH+DM8W group. In DM groups, SOD activity, ALDH2 mRNA and protein levels were reduced, MDA content was increased compared with control group; which decreased further as diabetes progressed. Compared with DM8W group, SOD and ALDH2 in EtOH+DM8W group was increased, MDA was decreased. Our results indicated with the development of diabetes, myocardial ALDH2 expression was further decreased accompanying decreased ventricular function. However, activation of ALDH2 can decrease diabetes induced myocardial injury. ALDH2 may be one key endogenous cardiac protective factor in diabetic individuals.
9007522	NS-49, an alpha 1A-adrenoceptor agonist, selectively increases intraurethral pressure in dogs.	The effects of NS-49 ((R)-(-)-3'-(2-amino-1-hydroxyethyl)-4'-fluoromethane sulfonanilide hydrochloride), an alpha 1A-adrenoceptor-selective agonist, on intraurethral pressure and blood pressure were investigated in anesthetized dogs. In addition, the contractile effects of NS-49 on the isolated dog urethra and carotid artery were compared with those of non-selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonists. Intravenously (i.v.) administered NS-49 at 0.3 microgram/kg or more significantly increased intraurethral pressure in a dose-dependent manner. Much higher doses of NS-49 were needed to increase blood pressure. In contrast, ST-1059 (1-(2',5'-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-aminoethanol) (an active metabolite of midodrine) at 30 micrograms/kg or more significantly increased both intraurethral pressure and blood pressure. NS-49 was 11-fold more selective for intraurethral pressure than ST-1059, NS-49, ST-1059, phenylephrine and noradrenaline caused concentration-dependent contraction of the isolated dog urethra. NS-49 caused only a slight contraction of the dog carotid artery even at high concentrations, whereas the reference drugs caused contractions of the artery with high efficacy. The alpha 1A-adrenoceptor-selective antagonists 5-methyl-urapidil and WB-4101 also showed high affinity for alpha 1-adrenoceptors in the dog urethra in inhibiting [3H]prazosin binding. In conclusion, the alpha 1A-selective agonist NS-49 selectively increased intraurethral pressure in dogs, and produced selective contraction of the dog urethra. These results suggest that the alpha 1A-adrenoceptor subtype is responsible for the contraction of the urethra and the regulation of intraurethral pressure, and that NS-49 might be useful for the treatment of stress incontinence with little effect on the cardiovascular system.
23406949	Evaluation of oxidant-antioxidant status in oral toxicity of fish oil methyl esters and diesel fuel in male rats.	This study was conducted to compare the effects of oral toxicity induced by fish oil biodiesel and diesel fuel. Diesel and fish oil biodiesel were administered by oral gavage to rats. For this purpose, 35 rats were divided into five groups. Sunflower oil of 250 mg kg(-1) was administered to the rats in the control group by oral gavage. The rats in the D250 and D500 groups were administered by oral gavage 250 mg kg(-1) and 500 mg kg(-1) of diesel fuel dissolved in equal amounts of sunflower oil, respectively. The rats in the F250 and F500 groups were administered by oral gavage 250 mg kg(-1) and 500 mg kg(-1) of fish oil biodiesel dissolved in equal amounts of sunflower oil, respectively. At the end of the study, malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels were measured in the whole blood; catalase (CAT) activity level was measured in erythrocytes; and nitrite (NO(2)) and nitrate (NO(3)) levels were measured in the serum. It was observed that the whole blood MDA levels of the diesel groups were considerably different from those in the control and fish oil biodiesel groups (p < 0.001). GSH levels in the control group were observed to be considerably different from those in all other groups (p < 0.001). Serum NO(3) concentrations in the diesel groups were found to be considerably different from those in the control and biodiesel groups. Serum NO(2) concentrations in one of the diesel groups were significantly different from those in the control and biodiesel groups (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). The CAT activity of the control group was observed to be different from that in the other groups. According to these results, both fish oil biodiesel and diesel fuel are thought to cause lipid peroxidation. It was observed that fish oil biodiesel does not induce as much oxidative damage as does the diesel fuel. It is suggested that fish oil biodiesel should be preferred as an alternative to the diesel.
23397054	Saturable active efflux by p-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein at the blood-brain barrier leads to nonlinear distribution of elacridar to the central nervous system.	The study objective was to investigate factors that affect the central nervous system (CNS) distribution of elacridar. Elacridar inhibits transport mediated by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp) and has been used to study the influence of transporters on brain distribution of chemotherapeutics. Adequate distribution of elacridar across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and into the brain parenchyma is necessary to target tumor cells in the brain that overexpress transporters and reside behind an intact BBB. We examined the role of P-gp and Bcrp on brain penetration of elacridar using Friend leukemia virus strain B wild-type, Mdr1a/b(-/-), Bcrp1(-/-), and Mdr1a/b(-/-)Bcrp1(-/-) mice. Initially, the mice were administered 2.5 mg/kg of elacridar intravenously, and the plasma and brain concentrations were determined. The brain-to-plasma partition coefficient of elacridar in the wild-type mice was 0.82, as compared with 3.5 in Mdr1a/b(-/-) mice, 6.6 in Bcrp1(-/-) mice, and 15 in Mdr1a/b(-/-)Bcrp1(-/-) mice, indicating that both P-gp and Bcrp limit the brain distribution of elacridar. The four genotypes were then administered increasing doses of elacridar, and the CNS distribution of elacridar was determined. The observed and model predicted maximum brain-to-plasma ratios (Emax) at the highest dose were not significantly different in all genotypes. However, the ED50 was lower for Mdr1a/b(-/-) mice compared with Bcrp1(-/-) mice. These findings correlate with the relative expression of P-gp and Bcrp at the BBB in these mice and demonstrate the quantitative enhancement in elacridar CNS distribution as a function of its dose. Overall, this study provides useful concepts for future applications of elacridar as an adjuvant therapy to improve targeting of chemotherapeutic agents to tumor cells in the brain parenchyma.
17636172	Effects of ACTH and expression of the melanocortin-2 receptor in the neonatal mouse testis.	ACTH has been shown to stimulate androgen production by the fetal/neonatal mouse testis through the melanocortin type 2 receptor (MC2R). This study was designed to localize the expression of MC2R in the neonatal mouse testis and characterize the effects of ACTH on testicular androgen production. Using immunohistochemistry, MC2R was localized to the fetal-type Leydig cell population of the neonatal testis. ACTH caused a time-dependent increase in cyclic AMP (cAMP) and testosterone production by isolated cells with an increase in cAMP apparent in < 3 min. There was no additive effect of maximally stimulating doses of ACTH and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Androgen production in response to ACTH and hCG was reduced by UO126 and dexamethasone, which are the inhibitors of ERK1/2 and phospholipase A2 respectively. Expression of mRNA encoding StAR was increased fourfold by both ACTH and hCG, although expression of mRNA encoding for steroidogenic enzymes was not markedly affected. The potency of N-terminal fragments of ACTH to stimulate androgen production was similar to that seen previously in the adrenal. Data indicate that both LH and ACTH, acting through their respective receptors, stimulate steroidogenesis by fetal-type Leydig cells via arachidonic acid, protein kinase A, and ERK1/2 activation of StAR.
23500536	Characterization of monomeric and multimeric snake neurotoxins and other bioactive proteins from the venom of the lethal Australian common copperhead (Austrelaps superbus).	Envenomation by Australian copperheads results mainly in muscle paralysis largely attributed to the presence of postsynaptic α-neurotoxins. However, poorly reversible neurotoxic effects suggest that these venoms may contain snake presynaptic phospholipase A2 neurotoxins (SPANs) that irreversibly inhibit neurotransmitter release. Using size-exclusion liquid chromatography, the present study isolated the first multimeric SPAN complex from the venom of the Australian common copperhead, Austrelaps superbus. The multimeric SPAN P-elapitoxin-As1a (P-EPTX-As1a) along with two novel monomeric SPANs and a new postsynaptic α-neurotoxin were then pharmacologically characterized using the chick biventer cervicis nerve-muscle preparation. All SPANs inhibited nerve-evoked twitch contractions at the neuromuscular junction without inhibiting contractile responses to cholinergic agonists or KCl. These actions are consistent with a prejunctional action to inhibit neurotransmitter release, without direct myotoxicity. Furthermore, the multimeric P-EPTX-As1a caused tetanic 'fade' in muscle tension under high frequency nerve stimulation, and produced a triphasic alteration to neurotransmitter release. These actions have been previously noted with other multimeric SPAN complexes such as taipoxin. Moreover, the neurotoxic α-subunit of P-EPTX-As1a shows high homology to taipoxin α-chain. Several other coagulopathic and myotoxic high mass proteins including a class PIII snake venom metalloproteinase, C-type lectin, l-amino acid oxidase, acetylcholinesterase and phospholipase B were also identified that may contribute to the overall toxicity of A. superbus venom. In conclusion, clinicians should be aware that early antivenom intervention might be necessary to prevent the onset of irreversible presynaptic neurotoxicity caused by multimeric and monomeric SPANs and that A. superbus venom is potentially capable of producing coagulopathic and myotoxic effects.
2125244	Stoichiometry of estramustine phosphate binding to MAP2 measured by the disassembly of chick brain MAP2:tubulin microtubules.	The concentration of estramustine phosphate required to inhibit the assembly or to induce the disassembly of chick brain MAP2:tubulin microtubules is markedly dependent upon the microtubule protein concentration. Analysis of this relationship shows that estramustine phosphate and tubulin compete for common MAP2 sites, that MAP2 can bind 5-6 moles.mole-1 estramustine phosphate, and that the Kd of these sites is congruent to 20 microM estramustine phosphate. It is proposed that two molecules of estramustine phosphate interact with each of the three tubulin-binding sites of MAP2 and inhibit the MAP2:tubulin interaction by neutralising two highly conserved basic residues.
23038767	"PUB-NChIP--""in vivo biotinylation"" approach to study chromatin in proximity to a protein of interest."	We have developed an approach termed PUB-NChIP (proximity utilizing biotinylation with native ChIP) to purify and study the protein composition of chromatin in proximity to a nuclear protein of interest. It is based on coexpression of (1) a protein of interest, fused with the bacterial biotin ligase BirA, together with (2) a histone fused to a biotin acceptor peptide (BAP), which is specifically biotinylated by BirA-fusion in the proximity of the protein of interest. Using the RAD18 protein as a model, we demonstrate that the RAD18-proximal chromatin is enriched in some H4 acetylated species. Moreover, the RAD18-proximal chromatin containing a replacement histone H2AZ has a different pattern of H4 acetylation. Finally, biotin pulse-chase experiments show that the H4 acetylation pattern starts to resemble the acetylation pattern of total H4 after the proximity of chromatin to RAD18 has been lost.
15311065	Cool (TRPM8) and hot (TRPV1) receptors in the bladder and male genital tract.	PURPOSE: Overactive bladder symptoms due to various etiologies have been successfully treated with capsaicin by desensitization of the temperature sensitive vanilloid receptor TRPV1. Recently another temperature sensitive receptor, TRPM8, activated by menthol and cool temperatures (8C to 28C) was described that may be the proposed cool receptor, at least in part mediating the bladder response in the diagnostic ice water test. We defined the sites of mRNA and protein expression of TRPM8 and TRPV1 in the rat and human genitourinary tract. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prostate, testis, penis, bladder and dorsal root ganglion tissue was obtained from rats. Prostate, testicle, seminiferous tubules, corpus cavernosum, glans, overlying glans skin, scrotal skin and bladder were obtained from human patients. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was done using species specific primers for TRPM8 and TRPV1. Immunofluorescence staining for TRPM8 was performed in rat tissues as well as in cultured human urothelial cells. RESULTS: TRPM8 and TRPV1 mRNA were detected in all rat tissues. Human samples demonstrated TRPM8 mRNA in prostate, testicle, seminiferous tubules, scrotal skin and bladder. No TRPM8 mRNA was identified in human corpus cavernosum, glans or overlying glans skin. Separation of layers in human bladder demonstrated mRNA for TRPM8 only in the urothelium and not in the detrusor. Immunofluorescence location of TRPM8 was found in rat prostate, DRG and bladder, and in human urothelial cells in culture. TRPV1 mRNA was detected in all human genitourinary tract tissues. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that mRNA and protein for TRPM8 exist in multiple genitourinary organs in the rat and human, and it may be considered a possible new target, as is TRPV1, for the pharmacological treatment of detrusor overactivity or other urological disorders.
3260648	Changes in sensitivity to anticancer drugs during TPA-induced cellular differentiation in a human T-lymphoblastoid cell line (MOLT-4).	After four days of treatment with 10(-8) M TPA, differentiation of the human T-lymphoblastoid cell line MOLT-4 was induced along the T cell lineage, confirmed by a fall in adenosine deaminase and 5'-ectonucleotidase and a rise in purine nucleoside phosphorylase activity. TPA-treated cells became resistant to the cytotoxic effects of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (Ara-C), 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine (Ara-A), and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine. This was, in part, due to the altered cell cycle distribution (accumulation of cells in the G1 phase), since the toxicity of Ara-C and Ara-A is S phase specific. The diminished rate of Ara-C transport concomitant with Ara-CTP formation after TPA treatment is considered to be the biochemical basis for this acquired resistance.
23473036	Adipose subtype-selective recruitment of TLE3 or Prdm16 by PPARγ specifies lipid storage versus thermogenic gene programs.	Transcriptional effectors of white adipocyte-selective gene expression have not been described. Here we show that TLE3 is a white-selective cofactor that acts reciprocally with the brown-selective cofactor Prdm16 to specify lipid storage and thermogenic gene programs. Occupancy of TLE3 and Prdm16 on certain promoters is mutually exclusive, due to the ability of TLE3 to disrupt the physical interaction between Prdm16 and PPARγ. When expressed at elevated levels in brown fat, TLE3 counters Prdm16, suppressing brown-selective genes and inducing white-selective genes, resulting in impaired fatty acid oxidation and thermogenesis. Conversely, mice lacking TLE3 in adipose tissue show enhanced thermogenesis in inguinal white adipose depots and are protected from age-dependent deterioration of brown adipose tissue function. Our results suggest that the establishment of distinct adipocyte phenotypes with different capacities for thermogenesis and lipid storage is accomplished in part through the cell-type-selective recruitment of TLE3 or Prdm16 to key adipocyte target genes.
15358979	Cerebral D2 and 5-HT2 receptor occupancy in Schizophrenic patients treated with olanzapine or clozapine.	We report the results of a double-blind, randomized prospective trial on D2 and 5-HT2 receptor occupancy and the clinical effects of olanzapine versus clozapine in a sample of neuroleptic-refractory schizophrenic patients. Receptor occupancy was evaluated in different cortical areas and in basal ganglia using [18F] fluoro-ethyl-spiperone ([18F] FESP) and positron emission tomography (PET). A total of 15 neuroleptic-free patients completed the study undergoing a baseline and a post-treatment PET scan (olanzapine, nine patients, one female; clozapine, six patients, three female) 8 weeks after starting treatment. PET data were analysed both by regions of interest and on a voxel-by-voxel basis using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM96). Olanzapine and clozapine induced a similar and significant inhibition of [18F] FESP binding index in the cortex. In the basal ganglia, receptor occupancy was significantly higher with olanzapine than with clozapine (p=0.0018). By contrast, no differences in receptor occupancy were detected at the level of the pituitary gland. Clinical outcomes, in particular a full extra pyramidal tolerability, were similar. In this sample of neuroleptic-refractory schizophrenic patients, olanzapine and clozapine showed a different pattern of occupancy of D2-like receptor despite a common lack of extrapyramidal side-effects.
8415655	Dominant expression of mRNA for prostaglandin D synthase in leptomeninges, choroid plexus, and oligodendrocytes of the adult rat brain.	Glutathione-independent prostaglandin D synthase [prostaglandin-H2 D-isomerase; (5Z,13E)-(15S)-9 alpha,11 alpha-epidioxy-15-hydroxyprosta-5,13-dienoate D-isomerase, EC 5.3.99.2] is an enzyme responsible for biosynthesis of prostaglandin D2 in the central nervous system. In situ hybridization with antisense RNA for the enzyme indicated that mRNA for the enzyme was predominantly expressed in the leptomeninges, choroid plexus, and oligodendrocytes of the adult rat brain. The findings agree with those obtained by immunohistochemical staining with antibodies against the enzyme. It was further revealed that prostaglandin D synthase activity was considerably greater in the isolated leptomeninges (14.2 nmol per min per mg of protein) and choroid plexus (7.0 nmol per min per mg of protein) than the activity in the whole brain (2.0 nmol per min per mg of protein). These results, taken together, indicate that the enzyme is mainly synthesized and located in the leptomeninges, choroid plexus, and oligodendrocytes in the brain.
17373776	Activation and coupling of the glutaminase and synthase reaction of glutamate synthase is mediated by E1013 of the ferredoxin-dependent enzyme, belonging to loop 4 of the synthase domain.	Crystal structures of glutamate synthase suggested that a conserved glutamyl residue of the synthase domain (E1013 of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase, FdGltS) may play a key role in activating glutamine binding and hydrolysis and ammonia transfer to the synthase site in this amidotransferase, in response to the ligation and redox state of the synthase site. The E1013D, N, and A, variants of FdGltS were overproduced in Escherichia coli cells, purified, and characterized. The amino acyl substitutions had no effect on the reactivity of the synthase site nor on the interaction with ferredoxin. On the contrary, a dramatic decrease of activity was observed with the D (approximately 100-fold), N and A (approximately 10,000-fold) variants, mainly due to an effect on the maximum velocity of the reaction. The E1013D variant showed coupling between glutamine hydrolysis at the glutaminase site and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-glutamate synthesis at the synthase site, but a sigmoid dependence of initial velocity on L-glutamine concentration. The E1013N variant exhibited hyperbolic kinetics, but the velocity of glutamine hydrolysis was twice that of glutamate synthesis from 2-oxoglutarate at the synthase site. These results are consistent with the proposed role of E1013 in signaling the presence of 2-oxoglutarate (and reducing equivalents) at the synthase site to the glutaminase site in order to activate it and to promote ammonia transfer to the synthase site through the ammonia tunnel. The sigmoid dependence of the initial velocity of the glutamate synthase reaction of the E1013D mutant on glutamine concentration provides evidence for a participation of glutamine in the activation of glutamate synthase during the catalytic cycle.
23562495	TRP and ASIC channels mediate the antinociceptive effect of citronellyl acetate.	Background Citronellyl acetate (CAT), a monoterpene product of the secondary metabolism of plants, has been shown in the literature to possess several different biological activities. However, no antinociceptive abilities have yet been discussed. Here, we used acute pain animal models to describe the antinociceptive action of CAT. Methods The acetic acid-induced writhing test and the paw-licking test, in which paw licking was induced by glutamate and formalin, were performed to evaluate the antinociceptive action of CAT and to determine the involvement of PKC, PKA, TRPV1, TRPA1, TRPM8 and ASIC in its antinociceptive mechanism. To do so, we induced paw-linking using agonists. Results CAT was administered intragastrically (25, 50, 75, 100 and 200mg/kg), and the two higher doses caused antinociceptive effects in the acetic acid model; the highest dose reduced pain for 4h after it was administered (200mg/kg). In the formalin test, two doses of CAT promoted antinociception in both the early and later phases of the test. The glutamate test showed that its receptors are involved in the antinociceptive mechanism of CAT. Pretreatment with CAT did not alter locomotor activity or motor coordination. In an investigation into the participation of TRP channels and ASICs in CAT's antinociceptive mechanism, we used capsaicin (2.2μg/paw), cinnamaldehyde (10mmol/paw), menthol (1.2mmol/paw) and acidified saline (2% acetic acid, pH 1.98). The results showed that TRPV1, TRPM8 and ASIC, but not TRPA1, are involved in the antinociceptive mechanism. Finally, the involvement of PKC and PKA was also studied, and we showed that both play a role in the antinociceptive mechanism of CAT. Conclusion The results of this work contribute information regarding the antinociceptive properties of CAT on acute pain and show that, at least in part, TRPV1, TRPM8, ASIC, glutamate receptors, PKC and PKA participate in CAT's antinociceptive mechanism.
3139361	Selectivity in progesterone and androgen receptor binding of progestagens used in oral contraceptives.	The relative binding affinities (RBAs) of four progestational compounds (norethisterone, levonorgestrel, 3-keto-desogestrel and gestodene) for the human progesterone and androgen receptors were measured in MCF-7 cytosol and intact MCF-7 cells. For the binding to the progesterone receptor, both Org 2058 and Org 3236 (or 3-keto-desogestrel) were used as labelled ligands. The following ranking (low to high) for the RBA of the nuclear (intact cells) progesterone receptor irrespective of the ligand used is found: norethisterone much less than levonorgestrel less than 3-keto-destogestrel less than gestodene. The difference between the various progestagens is significant with the exception of that between 3-keto-desogestrel and gestodene, when Org 2058 is used as ligand. For the cytosolic progesterone receptor, the same order is found with the exception that similar RBAs are found for gestodene and 3-keto-desogestrel. The four progestagens clearly differ with respect to binding to the androgen receptor using dihydrotestosterone as labelled ligand in intact cells; the ranking (low to high) is: norethisterone less than 3 keto-desogestrel less than levonorgestrel and gestodene. The difference between 3-keto-desogestrel and levonorgestrel or gestodene is significant. The selectivity indices (ratio of the mean RBA for the progesterone receptor to that of androgen receptor) in intact cells are significantly higher for 3-keto-desogestrel and gestodene than for levonorgestrel and norethisterone. From these results we conclude that the introduction of the 18-methyl in norethisterone (levonorgestel) increases both the binding to the progesterone and androgen receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
23071106	Potentiation of sulfonylurea action by an EPAC-selective cAMP analog in INS-1 cells: comparison of tolbutamide and gliclazide and a potential role for EPAC activation of a 2-APB-sensitive Ca2+ influx.	Tolbutamide and gliclazide block the K(ATP) channel K(ir)6.2/Sur1, causing membrane depolarization and stimulating insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells. We examined the ability of the EPAC-selective cAMP analog 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM to potentiate the action of these drugs and the mechanism that might account for it. Insulin secretion stimulated by both 200 μM tolbutamide and 20 μM gliclazide, concentrations that had equivalent effects on membrane potential, was inhibited by thapsigargin (1 μM) or the L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker nicardipine (2 μM) and was potentiated by 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM at concentrations ≥2 μM in INS-1 cells. Ca(2+) transients stimulated by either tolbutamide or gliclazide were inhibited by thapsigargin or nicardipine and were significantly potentiated by 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM at 5 μM but not 1 μM. Both tolbutamide and gliclazide stimulated phospholipase C activity; however, only gliclazide did so independently of its activity at K(ATP) channels, and this activity was partially inhibited by pertussis toxin. 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM alone (5 μM) did not stimulate insulin secretion, but did increase intracellular Ca(2+) concentration significantly, and this activity was inhibited by 25 μM 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate (2-APB) or the removal of extracellular Ca(2+). 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM potentiation of insulin secretion stimulated by tolbutamide was markedly inhibited by 2-APB (25 μM) and enhanced by the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I (1 μM). Our data demonstrate that the actions of both tolbutamide and gliclazide are strongly potentiated by 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM, that gliclazide can stimulate phospholipase C activity via a partially pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism, and that 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM potentiation of tolbutamide action may involve activation of a 2-APB-sensitive Ca(2+) influx.
23378191	Mending leaky blood vessels: the angiopoietin-Tie2 pathway in sepsis.	Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response to infection. A common end-feature, these patients regularly suffer from is the so-called multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, an often fatal consequence of organ hypoperfusion, coagulopathy, immune dysregulation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Microvascular dysfunction critically contributes to the morbidity and mortality of this disease. The angiopoietin (Angpt)/Tie2 system consists of the transmembrane endothelial tyrosine kinase Tie2 and its circulating ligands (Angpt-1, -2, and -3/4). The balance between the canonical agonist Angpt-1 and its competitive inhibitor, Angpt-2, regulates basal endothelial barrier function and the leakage and vascular inflammation that develop in response to pathogens and cytokines. Here we summarize recent work in mice and men to highlight the therapeutic potential in this pathway to prevent or even reverse microvascular dysfunction in this deadly disease.
1326878	Effects of nedocromil sodium on the binding of N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine in human neutrophils.	In the present study the inhibition by nedocromil sodium of the specific receptor binding of FMLP was evaluated in human neutrophils (PMNs) using a FMLP-(3H) binding assay. The time course of the binding was markedly influenced by nedocromil sodium used at a concentration of 300 microM. No significant inhibition was obtained when the cells were treated with nedocromil sodium 3 microM or with sodium cromoglycate 300 microM. FMLP binding is essentially eliminated by the highest dose of nedocromil sodium. The biologic meaning of this effect in asthmatic patients should be further evaluated.
11707860	DAB(389)IL-2 (denileukin diftitox, ONTAK): a new fusion protein technology.	Genetic engineering has led to the development of fusion protein toxins, which are targeted effector molecules that combine a targeting ligand such as a growth factor with a cytocidal moiety such as a plant or bacterial toxin. The first genetically constructed family of fusion proteins used diphtheria toxin as the toxophore for receptor-binding domain substitution. Diphtheria toxin consists of three domains: an enzymatically active adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribosyltransferase domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal receptor-binding domain. Introduction of the enzymatically active domain into the cytosol via receptor-mediated endocytosis results in inhibition of protein synthesis by ADP ribosylation of elongation-factor 2. DAB(486)IL-2, in which the native receptor-binding domain of diphtheria toxin was replaced with the full-length interleukin-2 (IL-2) gene, was capable of intoxicating high-affinity IL-2 receptor-bearing cells in vitro with an IC(50) of 10(-10) M; whereas, cells lacking the full component of the high-affinity IL-2 receptor (p55, p75, p64) were relatively resistant (IC(50) of 10(-8) M). Because of a short in vivo half-life of DAB(486)IL-2, efforts to reengineer the molecule were undertaken, leading to the DAB(389)IL-2 construct, which had a twofold to threefold higher Kd than DAB(486)IL-2 and a longer half-life, resulting in a tenfold increase in potency. Thus far, the clinical activity of both IL-2 chimeric fusion toxins has been similar, with the DAB(389)IL-2 molecule displaying more favorable pharmacokinetics.
23200901	The role of efflux transporters on the transport of highly toxic aconitine, mesaconitine, hypaconitine, and their hydrolysates, as determined in cultured Caco-2 and transfected MDCKII cells.	Aconitum alkaloids including aconitine (AC), mesaconitine (MA), hypaconitine (HA), are highly toxic. Their hydrolysates, such as benzoylaconine (BAC), benzoylmesaconine (BMA), benzoylhypaconine (BHA), aconine, and mesaconine, are considerably less toxic. Efflux transporters, including P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and multidrug resistance-associated protein isoform 2 (MRP2), act as a first line of defence and play key roles in toxicity prevention. The aim of the present study was to determine the role of efflux transporters in the transport of Aconitum alkaloids using cultured Caco-2, MDR1-MDCKII and BCRP-MDCKII cells. Bidirectional transport assays of the Aconitum alkaloids were performed with or without P-gp (cyclosporine A and verapamil), BCRP (Ko143) and MRP2 (MK571) inhibitors. The efflux ratios (Er) of AC, MA, and HA in Caco-2 cells were 34.6±4.2, 29.7±2.1, and 15.6±2.1, respectively; those of BAC, BMA, and BHA were approximately 4, and those of aconine and mesaconine were equal to 1. The Er values of AC, MA, and HA in MDR1-MDCKII and BCRP-MDCKII cells were significantly higher than those in parental MDCKII cells. Taken together the results of Er values and intracellular amounts in the presence of inhibitors, P-gp and BCRP were involved in the transport of AC, MA and HA; and MRP2 might transport AC, MA, HA, BAC, BMA and BHA.
23600402	Assessing the Accuracy and Performance of Implicit Solvent Models for Drug Molecules: Conformational Ensemble Approaches.	The accuracy and performance of implicit solvent methods for solvation free energy calculations were assessed on a set of 20 neutral drug molecules. Molecular dynamics (MD) provided ensembles of conformations in water and water-saturated octanol. The solvation free energies were calculated by popular implicit solvent models based on quantum mechanical (QM) electronic densities (COSMO-RS, MST, SMD) as well as on molecular mechanical (MM) point-charge models (GB, PB). The performance of the implicit models was tested by a comparison with experimental water-octanol transfer free energies (ΔGow) by using single- and multiconformation approaches. MD simulations revealed difficulties in a priori estimation of the flexibility features of the solutes from simple structural descriptors, such as the number of rotatable bonds. An increasing accuracy of the calculated ΔGow was observed in the following order: GB1 ∼ PB < GB7 ≪ MST < SMD ∼ COSMO-RS with a clear distinction identified between MM- and QM-based models, although for the set excluding three largest molecules, the differences among COSMO-RS, MST, and SMD were negligible. It was shown that the single-conformation approach applied to crystal geometries provides a rather accurate estimate of ΔGow for rigid molecules yet fails completely for the flexible ones. The multiconformation approaches improved the performance, but only when the deformation contribution was ignored. It was revealed that for large-scale calculations on small molecules a recent GB model, GB7, provided a reasonable accuracy/speed ratio. In conclusion, the study contributes to the understanding of solvation free energy calculations for physical and medicinal chemistry applications.
14646100	Crystallization and preliminary crystallographic analysis of human serine dehydratase.	L-Serine dehydratase (SDH) catalyzes the pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) dependent deamination of L-serine to yield pyruvate. Recombinant human serine dehydratase was crystallized by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. Crystals were grown at 291 K using (NH4)(2)SO4 as precipitant. Diffraction data were obtained to a resolution of 2.5 A from a single frozen crystal using Cu Kalpha radiation. The crystal belongs to space group I422, with unit-cell parameters a = 157.4, b = 157.4, c = 59.2 A, alpha = beta = gamma = 90 degrees. The asymmetric unit contains one molecule and has a solvent content of about 46%.
23123253	New tools in diagnosis and biomonitoring of intoxications with organophosphorothioates: Case studies with chlorpyrifos and diazinon.	Organophosphate (OP) pesticides are neurotoxic compounds that are widely used in agriculture. Classical methods for monitoring OP exposure comprise the measurement of intact OP, its metabolites or cholinesterase activity. Newly developed methods focus on the analysis of the OP adduct bound to proteins such as butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) and albumin. These adducts can be analyzed by means of fluoride reactivation or by analysis with LC-MS/MS of the pepsin or pronase digest of butyrylcholinesterase and albumin, respectively. The utility of these methods is illustrated through the analysis of plasma samples obtained from patients taken 1-49days after ingestion of the organophosphate pesticides chlorpyrifos and/or diazinon. Thus, in this particular case several independent methodologies were applied to the biomedical samples, all pointing to the same exposure.
22936354	Inactivation of anoctamin-6/Tmem16f, a regulator of phosphatidylserine scrambling in osteoblasts, leads to decreased mineral deposition in skeletal tissues.	During vertebrate skeletal development, osteoblasts produce a mineralized bone matrix by deposition of hydroxyapatite crystals in the extracellular matrix. Anoctamin6/Tmem16F (Ano6) belongs to a conserved family of transmembrane proteins with chloride channel properties. In addition, Ano6 has been linked to phosphatidylserine (PS) scrambling in the plasma membrane. During skeletogenesis, Ano6 mRNA is expressed in differentiating and mature osteoblasts. Deletion of Ano6 in mice results in reduced skeleton size and skeletal deformities. Molecular analysis revealed that chondrocyte and osteoblast differentiation are not disturbed. However, mutant mice display increased regions of nonmineralized, Ibsp-expressing osteoblasts in the periosteum during embryonic development and increased areas of uncalcified osteoid postnatally. In primary Ano6(-/-) osteoblasts, mineralization is delayed, indicating a cell autonomous function of Ano6. Furthermore, we demonstrate that calcium-dependent PS scrambling is impaired in osteoblasts. Our study is the first to our knowledge to reveal the requirement of Ano6 in PS scrambling in osteoblasts, supporting a function of PS exposure in the deposition of hydroxyapatite.
23274894	G6PC2: A Negative Regulator of Basal Glucose-Stimulated Insulin Secretion.	Elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG) is associated with increased risk for the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular-associated mortality. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked polymorphisms in G6PC2 with variations in FBG and body fat, although not insulin sensitivity or glucose tolerance. G6PC2 encodes an islet-specific, endoplasmic reticulum-resident glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit. A combination of in situ perfused pancreas, in vitro isolated islet, and in vivo analyses were used to explore the function of G6pc2 in mice. G6pc2 deletion had little effect on insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, whereas body fat was reduced in female G6pc2 knockout (KO) mice on both a chow and high-fat diet, observations that are all consistent with human GWAS data. G6pc2 deletion resulted in a leftward shift in the dose-response curve for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). As a consequence, under fasting conditions in which plasma insulin levels were identical, blood glucose levels were reduced in G6pc2 KO mice, again consistent with human GWAS data. Glucose-6-phosphatase activity was reduced, whereas basal cytoplasmic calcium levels were elevated in islets isolated from G6pc2 KO mice. These data suggest that G6pc2 represents a novel, negative regulator of basal GSIS that acts by hydrolyzing glucose-6-phosphate, thereby reducing glycolytic flux.
23247009	Beta-glucogallin reduces the expression of lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory markers by inhibition of aldose reductase in murine macrophages and ocular tissues.	Aldose reductase (AR) catalyzes the reduction of toxic lipid aldehydes to their alcohol products and mediates inflammatory signals triggered by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Beta-glucogallin (BGG), a recently described AR inhibitor, was purified from extracts of the Indian gooseberry (Emblica officinalis). In this study, we found that BGG showed low cytotoxicity in Raw264.7 murine macrophages and effectively inhibited AR activity as measured by a decrease in sorbitol accumulation. In addition, BGG-mediated inhibition of AR prevented LPS-induced activation of JNK and p38 and lowered ROS levels, which could inhibit LPS-induced apoptosis. Uveitis is a disease of the eye associated with chronic inflammation. In this study, we also demonstrated that treatment with BGG decreased the number of inflammatory cells that infiltrate the ocular media of mice with experimental uveitis. Accordingly, these results suggest BGG is a potential therapy for inflammatory diseases.
17185414	Identification of NVP-TAE684, a potent, selective, and efficacious inhibitor of NPM-ALK.	Constitutive overexpression and activation of NPM-ALK fusion protein [t(2:5)(p23;q35)] is a key oncogenic event that drives the survival and proliferation of anaplastic large-cell lymphomas (ALCLs). We have identified a highly potent and selective small-molecule ALK inhibitor, NVP-TAE684, which blocked the growth of ALCL-derived and ALK-dependent cell lines with IC(50) values between 2 and 10 nM. NVP-TAE684 treatment resulted in a rapid and sustained inhibition of phosphorylation of NPM-ALK and its downstream effectors and subsequent induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. In vivo, NVP-TAE684 suppressed lymphomagenesis in two independent models of ALK-positive ALCL and induced regression of established Karpas-299 lymphomas. NVP-TAE684 also induced down-regulation of CD30 expression, suggesting that CD30 may be used as a biomarker of therapeutic NPM-ALK kinase activity inhibition.
23639801	A selective antagonist reveals a potential role of G protein-coupled receptor 55 in platelet and endothelial cell function.	The G protein coupled receptor 55 (GPR55) is a lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) receptor that is also responsive to certain cannabinoids. Although GPR55 has been implicated in several (patho)physiological functions, its role is still enigmatic mainly owing to the lack of selective GPR55 antagonists. Here we show that the compound CID16020046 ((4-[4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3-(4-methylphenyl)-6-oxo-1H,4H,5H,6H-pyrrolo [3,4-c] pyrazol-5-yl] benzoic acid) is a selective GPR55 antagonist. In yeast cells expressing human GPR55, CID16020046 antagonized agonist-induced receptor activation. In HEK293 cells stably expressing human GPR55 (HEK-GPR55), the compound behaved as an antagonist on LPI-mediated Ca2+ release and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) activation, but not in HEK293 cells expressing cannabinoid receptor 1 or 2 (CB1 or CB2). CID16020046 concentration-dependently inhibited LPI-induced activation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), nuclear factor kappa of activated B cells (NF-κB) and serum response element (SRE), translocation of NFAT and NF-κB, and GPR55 internalization. It reduced LPI-induced wound healing in primary human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-L) and reversed LPI-inhibited platelet aggregation, suggesting a novel role for GPR55 in platelet and endothelial cell function. CID16020046 is therefore a valuable tool to study GPR55-mediated mechanisms in primary cells and tissues.
16982809	PPARgamma controls CD1d expression by turning on retinoic acid synthesis in developing human dendritic cells.	Dendritic cells (DCs) expressing CD1d, a molecule responsible for lipid antigen presentation, are capable of enhancing natural killer T (iNKT) cell proliferation. The signals controlling CD1 expression and lipid antigen presentation are poorly defined. We have shown previously that stimulation of the lipid-activated transcription factor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma, indirectly regulates CD1d expression. Here we demonstrate that PPARgamma, turns on retinoic acid synthesis by inducing the expression of retinol and retinal metabolizing enzymes such as retinol dehydrogenase 10 and retinaldehyde dehydrogenase type 2 (RALDH2). PPARgamma-regulated expression of these enzymes leads to an increase in the intracellular generation of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) from retinol. ATRA regulates gene expression via the activation of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR)alpha in human DCs, and RARalpha acutely regulates CD1d expression. The retinoic acid-induced elevated expression of CD1d is coupled to enhanced iNKT cell activation. Furthermore, in vivo relevant lipids such as oxidized low-density lipoprotein can also elicit retinoid signaling leading to CD1d up-regulation. These data show that regulation of retinoid metabolism and signaling is part of the PPARgamma-controlled transcriptional events in DCs. The uncovered mechanisms allow the DCs to respond to altered lipid homeostasis by changing CD1 gene expression.
23532375	ERP evidence suggests executive dysfunction in ecstasy polydrug users.	BACKGROUND: Deficits in executive functions such as access to semantic/long-term memory have been shown in ecstasy users in previous research. Equally, there have been many reports of equivocal findings in this area. The current study sought to further investigate behavioural and electro-physiological measures of this executive function in ecstasy users. METHOD: Twenty ecstasy-polydrug users, 20 non-ecstasy-polydrug users and 20 drug-naïve controls were recruited. Participants completed background questionnaires about their drug use, sleep quality, fluid intelligence and mood state. Each individual also completed a semantic retrieval task whilst 64 channel Electroencephalography (EEG) measures were recorded. RESULTS: Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) revealed no between-group differences in behavioural performance on the task. Mixed ANOVA on event-related potential (ERP) components P2, N2 and P3 revealed significant between-group differences in the N2 component. Subsequent exploratory univariate ANOVAs on the N2 component revealed marginally significant between-group differences, generally showing greater negativity at occipito-parietal electrodes in ecstasy users compared to drug-naïve controls. Despite absence of behavioural differences, differences in N2 magnitude are evidence of abnormal executive functioning in ecstasy-polydrug users.
23122161	Suppression of LPS-induced inflammatory activities by Rosmarinus officinalis L.	Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) has been used in folk medicine to treat headaches, epilepsy, poor circulation, and many other ailments. It was found that rosemary could act as a stimulant and mild analgesic and could reduce inflammation. However, the mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory effects of rosemary need more study to be established. Therefore, in this study, the effects of rosemary on the activation of nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-kB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and the production of nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), and cytokine in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells were investigated. A methanol extract of rosemary and its hexane fraction reduced NO generation with an IC(50) of 2.75 and 2.83 μg/ml, respectively. Also, the methanol extract and the hexane fraction inhibited LPS-induced MAPKs and NF-kB activation associated with the inhibition of iNOS or COX-2 expression. LPS-induced production of PGE(2) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) were blocked by rosemary. Rosemary extract and its hexane fraction are important for the prevention of phosphorylation of MAPKs, thereby blocking NF-kB activation, which in turn leads to decreased expression of iNOS and COX-2, thus preventing inflammation.
23259841	Visualization and virtual screening of the chemical universe database GDB-17.	"The chemical universe database GDB-17 contains 166.4 billion molecules of up to 17 atoms of C, N, O, S, and halogens obeying rules for chemical stability, synthetic feasibility, and medicinal chemistry. GDB-17 was analyzed using 42 integer value descriptors of molecular structure which we term ""Molecular Quantum Numbers"" (MQN). Principal component analysis and representation of the (PC1, PC2)-plane provided a graphical overview of the GDB-17 chemical space. Rapid ligand-based virtual screening (LBVS) of GDB-17 using the city-block distance CBD(MQN) as a similarity search measure was enabled by a hashed MQN-fingerprint. LBVS of the entire GDB-17 and of selected subsets identified shape similar, scaffold hopping analogs (ROCS > 1.6 and T(SF) < 0.5) of 15 drugs. Over 97% of these analogs occurred within CBD(MQN) ≤ 12 from each drug, a constraint which might help focus advanced virtual screening. An MQN-searchable 50 million subset of GDB-17 is publicly available at www.gdb.unibe.ch ."
23578391	Perinatal exposure to BDE-99 causes learning disorders and decreases serum thyroid hormone levels and BDNF gene expression in hippocampus in rat offspring.	Exposure of pregnant women to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) may mean serious health risks. The main goal of the present study was to examine the neurobehavioral changes in rat offspring that were perinatally exposed to one of the most prevalent PBDEs congeners found in humans, 2,2',4,4',5-pentaBDE (BDE-99). Rat dams were exposed to 0, 1 and 2mg/kg/day of BDE-99 from gestation day 6 to post-natal day 21. When pups were weaning, cortex and hippocampal gene expressions of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) of the different isoforms of the thyroid hormone (TH) receptors (TRs) were evaluated. Serum TH levels were also determined. The remaining pups were assessed by neurobehavioral testing for learning and memory function. The results showed that maternal transference of BDE-99 produced a delay in the spatial learning task in the water maze test. Moreover, the open-field test revealed a significant dose-response anxiolytic effect. It was also found that the serum levels of triiodothyronine (T3), tetraiiodothyronine (T4) and free-T4 (FT4) decreased. Although no effect on the gene expression of the different isoforms of TRs was observed, the expression of the TH-mediated gene BDNF was down-regulated in the hippocampus. These results indicate a clear signal disruption of TH and reinforce previous studies in which neurotoxic effects of PBDEs in animal research were observed at levels comparable to those found in humans.
23381641	Differential autophagic cell death under stress with ectopic cytoplasmic and mitochondrial-specific PPP2R2B in human neuroblastoma cells.	Protein phosphatase 2A is one of four major classes of serine/threonine phosphatases. Overexpression of brain-specific regulatory subunit PPP2R2 in neuron cells is implicated in pathogenesis. The alternative splicing of PPP2R2B encodes two isoforms. They are subunit of cytoplasmic specific Bβ1 and mitochondria-targeted Bβ2. The two constructs were transfected into human neuroblastoma cells, SK-N-SH, respectively, and the stable clones overexpressing either Bβ1 or Bβ2 established. We have reported that Bβ2 clones are sensitive to reactive oxygen species (ROS) treatment by inducing autophagic cell death. To study more on the onset of neuropathogenesis under strain, both clones were exposed to different environmental stress, e.g. starvation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. To learn how PPP2R2B overexpression responds to starvation, cells were incubated in Hank's buffered salt solution of deprived nutrient. Cell death was induced in Bβ1 clones after 6 h starvation, but not in Bβ2 clones. The pharmacological inhibitor, Bafilomycin A1, rescued the cell death while suppressing autophagy. On the other hand, to assess how cells respond to ER stress, the cells were treated with 0.1 μM of N-glycosylation inhibitor, tunicamycin (TM). In contrast with Bβ1, the apoptotic cell death appeared in Bβ2 after 48 h treatment. The formation of autophagolysosome was detected in Bβ2 following 12 h treatment with TM as evidenced by lysotracker and GFP-LC3 staining for fluorescence microscopy analysis. The autophagy inhibitor, 3-methyladenine, salvaged the final apoptosis. The stable cell lines with ectopically transfected PPP2R2B genes encoding isoforms of brain-specific regulatory subunit exhibit distinct apoptosis under different stressors. The induced autophagic apoptotic cell death is related to mitochondrial membrane potential drop and ROS generation. Disturbance of autophagy alleviates the induced cell death. The results promised a good model for understanding the onset in pathogenesis under stress in neuron cells with aberrant PPP2R2B expression.
1386491	Effectiveness of endopeptidase inhibition (candoxatril) in congestive heart failure.	Candoxatril is a novel, orally active inhibitor of neutral endopeptidase EC 3.4.24.11, the enzyme that degrades atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). The acute and chronic (10 days treatment) hemodynamic and hormonal effects of candoxatril (150 mg twice daily) in 12 patients with moderately severe congestive heart failure were investigated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. On study day 1, candoxatril acutely increased plasma ANP levels, suppressed aldosterone and decreased right atrial and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures. After 10 days of treatment, basal ANP was increased and basal aldosterone was decreased. Body weight was reduced, most likely reflecting chronic natriuretic or diuretic effects, or both, and there was a trend toward increased cardiac index and reduced preload values. On study day 10, the acute effects of candoxatril were similar to those on day 1 (i.e., ANP was further increased, aldosterone was suppressed, and right and left ventricular filling pressures were decreased). Thus, candoxatril may offer a new and effective therapeutic approach in the treatment of heart failure.
15069170	Four novel mutations in the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl co-transporter gene in Japanese patients with Gitelman's syndrome.	BACKGROUND: Gitelman's syndrome (GS) is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from inactivating mutations in the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl co-transporter (NCCT) gene. To date, almost 90 mutations have been identified. It is possible that there is a population-specific distribution of mutations. In this study, we analysed mutations in the NCCT gene of seven Japanese patients with GS. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from patients with GS, their family members and healthy control subjects. A mutation analysis of the NCCT gene was performed completely by direct automated sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA products. In patients with a deletion or splice site mutation, we undertook cDNA sequence analysis. RESULTS: We identified nine mutations. Five of them [c.185C>T (Thr60Met), c.1712C>T (Ala569Val), c.1930C>T (Arg642Cys), c.2552T>A (Leu849His) and c.1932delC] have been reported in Japanese patients, but not in GS patients from other ethnic groups. The remaining four mutations [c.7A>T (Met1Leu), c.1181_1186+20del26, c.1811_1812delAT and IVS16+1G>A] were novel. In cDNA derived from a patient with c.1181_1186+20del26, a deletion of exon 9 and a frameshift at the start of exon 10 were observed. In cDNA derived from patients with IVS16+1G>A, an additional 96 bp insertion between exons 16 and 17 was observed. Six out of seven patients were compound heterozygotes, and the remaining one carried a single heterozygous mutation. CONCLUSIONS: We found four novel mutations in the NCCT gene in seven Japanese patients with GS. Moreover, our study suggests that the distribution of mutations in the NCCT gene in Japanese GS patients potentially differs from that in other populations.
9080465	Effects of SR 48692 on neurotensin-induced calcium-activated chloride currents in the Xenopus oocyte expression system: agonist-like activity on the levocabastine-sensitive neurotensin receptor and absence of antagonist effect on the levocabastine insensitive neurotensin receptor.	The effect of the drug SR 48692 on the Ca(2+)-activated Cl- current induced by neurotensin on Xenopus oocytes injected with cRNAs encoding rodent high and low affinity neurotensin receptors, was examined. In this receptor expression system, SR 48692 failed to antagonize electrophysiological measurement of neurotensin-evoked current via the rat high affinity neurotensin receptor, whereas its application onto oocytes expressing the mouse low affinity neurotensin receptor triggered an inward current, as well as neurotensin itself. However, no current activation was observed after application of the drug on oocytes expressing the rat high affinity neurotensin receptor. These observations in the oocyte expression system did not reflect typical antagonist properties of SR 48692 drug.
22709945	Neonatal exposure to low dose corticosterone persistently modulates hippocampal mineralocorticoid receptor expression and improves locomotor/exploratory behaviour in a mouse model of Rett syndrome.	Rett syndrome (RTT) is a pervasive neurodevelopmental disorder, primarily affecting girls. RTT causes a wide variety of debilitating symptoms and no cure currently exists. Mouse models bearing mutations in the Mecp2 gene recapitulate most physiological and behavioural RTT-related abnormalities. Stimulating neonatal environments (e.g. brief maternal separations or maternal low-dose corticosterone supplementation) reduce stress and fear responses at adulthood. The present study investigated whether impacting early in development the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, by exposing Mecp2-308 mutant pups to a low dose of corticosterone (50 µg/ml, during the 1st week of life) may contrast RTT-related abnormalities in neuroendocrine regulation and behavioural adaptation at adulthood. In line with previous reports, when fully symptomatic, MeCP2-308 mice showed a reduction in the regular nocturnal hyperactivity in the home-cage and increased anxiety-like behaviours and plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels in response to restraint stress. An abnormal elevation in mRNA levels of mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) and BDNF gene was also evident in the hippocampus of fully symptomatic mutant mice. Neonatal CORT modulated MR gene expression and behavioural reactivity towards a novel object, also restoring wt-like levels of locomotor/exploratory behaviour in mutant mice. Enhanced sensitivity to the neonatal treatment (in terms of increase in GR and MR mRNA levels), was also evident in the hippocampus of MeCP2-308 mice compared to wt littermates. Present results corroborate the hypothesis that targeting the glucocorticoid system may prove valid in contrasting at least some of the RTT-related symptoms and provide evidence that pharmacological interventions during critical early time windows can persistently improve the behavioural phenotype of RTT mice. Current data also support the emerging role played by Mecp2 in mediating the epigenetic programming induced by early life events and indicate that, in the absence of functional MeCP2, programming of the central nervous system in response to early environmental stimuli is abnormally regulated. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 'Neurodevelopmental Disorders'.
23200255	Phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Part 5: hybrid PDE3/4 inhibitors as dual bronchorelaxant/anti-inflammatory agents for inhaled administration.	(-)-6-(7-Methoxy-2-(trifluoromethyl)pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-4-yl)-5-methyl-4,5-dihydropyridazin-3(2H)-one (KCA-1490) exhibits moderate dual PDE3/4-inhibitory activity and promises as a combined bronchodilatory/anti-inflammatory agent. N-alkylation of the pyridazinone ring markedly enhances potency against PDE4 but suppresses PDE3 inhibition. Addition of a 6-aryl-4,5-dihydropyridazin-3(2H)-one extension to the N-alkyl group facilitates both enhancement of PDE4-inhibitory activity and restoration of potent PDE3 inhibition. Both dihydropyridazinone rings, in the core and extension, can be replaced by achiral 4,4-dimethylpyrazolone subunits and the core pyrazolopyridine by isosteric bicyclic heteroaromatics. In combination, these modifications afford potent dual PDE3/4 inhibitors that suppress histamine-induced bronchoconstriction in vivo and exhibit promising anti-inflammatory activity via intratracheal administration.
15975002	Novel agents that potentially inhibit irinotecan-induced diarrhea.	Irinotecan (CPT-11, 7-ethyl-10-[4-(1-piperidino)-1-piperidino] carbonyloxycamptothecin) has exhibited clinical activities against a broad spectrum of carcinomas by inhibiting DNA topoisomerase I (Topo I). However, severe and unpredictable dosing-limiting toxicities (mainly myelosuppression and severe diarrhea) hinder its clinical use. The latter consists of early and late-onset diarrhea, occurring within 24 hr or > or = 24 hr after CPT-11 administration, respectively. This review highlights novel agents potentially inhibiting CPT-11-induced diarrhea, which are designed and tested under guidance of disposition pathways and potential toxicity mechanisms. Early-onset diarrhea is observed immediately after CPT-11 infusion and probably due to the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity, which can be eliminated by administration of atropine. Late-onset diarrhea appears to be associated with intestinal exposure to SN-38 (7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin), the major active metabolite of CPT-11, which may bind to Topo I and induce apoptosis of intestinal epithelia, leading to the disturbance in the absorptive and secretory functions of mucosa. CPT-11 and SN-38 may also stimulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and prostaglandins (PGs), thus inducing the secretion of Na(+) and Cl(-). Early treatment of severe late-onset diarrhea with oral high-dose loperamide has decreased patient morbidity. Extensive studies have been conducted to identify other potential agents to ameliorate diarrhea in preclinical and clinical models. These include intestinal alkalizing agents, oral antibiotics, enzyme inducers, P-glycoprotein (PgP) inhibitors, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors, or blockers of biliary excretion of SN-38. Further studies are needed to identify the molecular targets associated with CPT-11 toxicity and safe and effective agents for alleviating CPT-11-induced diarrhea.
17352516	Sitagliptin.	Sitagliptin, an oral dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, improves glycaemic control by inhibiting DPP-4 inactivation of the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide. This increases active incretin and insulin levels, and decreases glucagon levels and post-glucose-load glucose excursion. In large, well designed phase III trials in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, sitagliptin 100 or 200mg once daily alone or in combination with other antihyperglycaemics was associated with significant improvements relative to placebo in overall glycaemic control and indices for insulin response and beta-cell function. Improvements from baseline in mean glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) were significantly greater with sitagliptin monotherapy than with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes. As add-on therapy in patients with suboptimal glycaemic control despite oral antihyperglycaemic treatment, sitagliptin improved HbA(1c) to a significantly greater extent than placebo when added to metformin or pioglitazone and was noninferior to glipizide when added to metformin. Sitagliptin was well tolerated when administered alone or in combination with other antihyperglycaemics, with an adverse event profile similar to that shown with placebo. The incidence of hypoglycaemia with sitagliptin was similar to that with placebo and, in combination with metformin, lower than that with glipizide. Sitagliptin had a generally neutral effect on bodyweight.
23578846	Biodegradable microparticles for strictly regulating the release of neurotrophic factors.	A lot of research has been carried out in the last decade to find a cure for neurodegenerative diseases especially Parkinson's disease but to little avail. In this study we have demonstrated the use of poly (lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)/collagen biodegradable microparticles formed using water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) double emulsion method, as a neurotrophic factor delivery vehicle. The microparticles were encapsulated with glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) fused with collagen binding peptide (CBP) immobilized to the inner collagen phase. The novelty lies in the strict regulation of release of GDNF-CBP from the microparticles as compared to a burst release from standard microparticles. The microparticles were demonstrated to be non-cytotoxic till 300μg/2×10(5) cells and revealed a maximum release of 250ng GDNF-CBP/mg microparticles in 0.3% collagenase. Differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) into mature neurons was demonstrated by co-culturing microparticles with cells in a medium containing collagenase which enabled the release of encapsulated GDNF-CBP, signaling the differentiation of NPCs into microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2)-expressing neurons. The successful ability of these microparticles to deliver neurotrophic factors and allow differentiation of NPCs into mature neurons provides some scope in its use for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases.
9073168	Differential expression of five N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit mRNAs in vasopressin and oxytocin neuroendocrine cells.	Vasopressin and oxytocin neuroendocrine cells within the supraoptic nucleus display distinctive electrophysiological properties and differential responses to selected NMDA receptor (NR) antagonists. To determine if these differences might be due to NMDA receptor composition, we compared the expression of NR1, NR2A, NR2B, NR2C and NR2D subunit mRNAs in immunocytochemically identified vasopressin and oxytocin neuroendocrine cells. In contrast to NR1 subunit mRNA which was equally expressed in both vasopressin and oxytocin cells, NR2B and NR2C displayed very different expression patterns. In oxytocin cells, the NR2B subunit comprised the majority (65%) of the total NR2 expression with NR2C and NR2D contributing 6% and 27%, respectively. Vasopressin cells exhibited 5-fold higher NR2C (32%), approximately half as much NR2B mRNA (39%) and equivalent NR2D (31%). In vitro expression studies have shown that the NR1-NR2C subunit combination exhibits weaker magnesium block and higher affinity for glycine than NR1-NR2B. Thus, the high expression of NR2C in vasopressin cells relative to oxytocin cells may make these cells more susceptible to glutamatergic activation. These observations in vasopressin and oxytocin cells provide the basis for a working model to investigate how differential NMDA receptor composition may shape the neurophysiological properties of neurons.
24261583	Efficacy, safety and clinical pharmacology of macitentan in comparison to other endothelin receptor antagonists in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension.	INTRODUCTION: Macitentan is a novel dual endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) showing sustained receptor occupancy. In vitro and in vivo animal studies have demonstrated its potency in antagonizing endothelin-induced disorders. A large morbidity/mortality study in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) taking macitentan has been completed recently. AREAS COVERED: This drug evaluation reviews the efficacy, safety and clinical pharmacology of macitentan in the treatment of PAH. EXPERT OPINION: The large Phase III study (SERAPHIN) tested macitentan in more than 700 PAH patients and has provided unique long-term outcome data for this ERA, not available for other members of this class. The effect on a composite clinically relevant morbidity/mortality end point was highly significant at a 10 mg/day dose. The safety profile of macitentan appears to be superior with respect to hepatic safety and edema/fluid retention than bosentan and ambrisentan, respectively, and is similar when considering decrease in hemoglobin concentration. The drug has a low propensity for drug-drug interactions and has one circulating pharmacologically active metabolite. The pharmacokinetics of macitentan in patients with renal or hepatic impairment does not require dose adjustments. Based on its characteristics, macitentan is an important addition to the therapeutic armamentarium in the long-term treatment of PAH. Its potential use in other disorders is under investigation.
12974388	The activator-binding site of Onchocerca volvulus S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, a potential drug target.	S-Adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC) is a key enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis. In many eukaryotes its activity is stimulated specifically by putrescine. The AdoMetDC of the filarial parasite Onchocerca volvulus, however, is not only stimulated by putrescine but also by the naturally occuring polyamines spermidine and spermine. Several diamines, acetylated polyamines and polyamine analogues were used to analyse what molecular prerequisites are needed to stimulate nematode AdoMetDC activity. In the absence of an activator, the O. volvulus enzyme exhibits an extremely low specific activity. This fact, together with the unspecificity of activator binding, was thought to be useful for a new strategy to inhibit nematode AdoMetDC activity. Therefore, different polyamine analogues were tested as competitive inhibitors towards the stimulatory effect putrescine has on the O. volvulus and, in comparison, on the Caenorhabditis elegans and human AdoMetDC. Bis(aralkyl)- and bis(alkyl)-substituted polyamine analogues with a 3-7-3 backbone were found to inhibit AdoMetDC activities, however, probably without interfering with the putrescine stimulation. The best inhibitor, BW-1, was about 10-fold more effective against O. volvulus AdoMetDC than against the human enzyme. Unexpectedly, BW-1 was determined to be a competitive inhibitor with respect to AdoMet, having a Ki value of 310 microM for the putrescine-stimulated human AdoMetDC. Furthermore, we show for the O. volvulus and the human enzyme that the degree of inhibition by BW-1 depends on the actual putrescine concentration.
11243491	Comparison of antidepressant activity in 4- and 40-week-old male mice in the forced swimming test: involvement of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors in old mice.	RATIONALE: A recent study suggested that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were inactive in 40-week-old male mice in the mouse forced swimming test, possibly because of alteration of 5-HT1 receptors. OBJECTIVES: The present study was aimed at investigating the action of various antidepressant drugs in 4- and 40-week-old male mice using the mouse forced swimming test and determining the involvement of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors mediating the effects. METHODS: Different classes of antidepressants [imipramine (tricyclic), maprotiline (noradrenline reuptake inhibitor), venlafaxine (mixed serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors), fluvoxamine and sertraline (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor)] were tested in the same randomised experimental session, alone and in combination with 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptor agonists [buspirone (partial 5-HT1A agonist), anpirtoline (5-HT1B agonist)] in the mouse forced swimming test. RESULTS: All antidepressants were found to be active in the mouse forced swimming test in 4-week-old mice and 40-week-old mice, with the exception of fluvoxamine in the 40-week-old mice. The anti-immobility effect after antidepressant administration was higher in 4-week-old male mice than in 40-week-old male mice. Venlafaxine is the most active antidepressant drug in 40-week-old mice. Prior administration of buspirone (0.06 mg/kg, i.p.) or anpirtoline (1 mg/kg, i.p.) enhanced the antidepressant-like effects in 4-week-old mice (except in the case of sertraline, 8 mg/kg). In elderly mice, only prior administration of buspirone enhanced the antidepressant-like effects of fluvoxamine. A neurochemical study showed that significantly higher serotonin and dopamine concentrations were found in 40-week-old control mice brains than 4-week-old control mice brains but that the noradrenaline concentration is higher in 4-week-old mice. CONCLUSION: Tricyclic, noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors and serotonin reuptake inhibitors are more active in 4-week-old mice than 40-week-old mice. Our results suggested that 5-HT1B receptors may be more altered than 5-HT1A receptors in 40-week-old mice.
22889582	Can the chemical reactivity of an ultimate carcinogen be related to its carcinogenicity? An application to propylene oxide.	In this article we report calculations of the activation free energy for a chemical reaction between propylene oxide and DNA, in particular with the guanine at the N7 position. Calculations were performed using Hartree-Fock and MP2 methods in conjunction with flexible basis sets. The effects of solvation were considered using the Langevin dipoles and solvent reaction field methods. The calculated activation free energies are in good agreement with the experimental value of 25.36 kcal/mol. Moreover, the reactivities of a series of ultimate carcinogens of the epoxy type toward DNA are shown to be related to their carcinogenicities. Higher reactivity is generally associated with higher carcinogenicity, although transport properties, reactions with ultimate carcinogen scavengers, and the DNA correction mechanism are also very important. It is very likely that the window of reactivity rather than a high reactivity value is the relevant measure of carcinogenicity, since highly reactive ultimate carcinogens interact with water and proteins before they reach DNA.
16926278	A 46-amino acid segment in phosphodiesterase-5 GAF-B domain provides for high vardenafil potency over sildenafil and tadalafil and is involved in phosphodiesterase-5 dimerization.	Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) contains a catalytic domain (C domain) that hydrolyzes cGMP and a regulatory domain (R domain) that contains two mammalian cGMP-binding phosphodiesterase, Anabaena adenylyl cyclases, Escherichia coli FhlAs (GAFs) (A and B) and a phosphorylation site for cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases (cNPKs). Binding of cGMP to GAF-A increases cNPK phosphorylation of PDE5 and improves catalytic site affinity for cGMP or inhibitors. GAF-B contributes to dimerization of PDE5, inhibition of cGMP binding to GAF-A, and sequestration of the phosphorylation site. To probe potential PDE5 R domain effects on catalytic site affinity for certain inhibitors, four N-terminal truncation mutants were generated: PDE5Delta1-321 contained GAF-B domain, C domain, and the sequence between GAF-A and -B; PDE5Delta1-419 contained GAF-B and C domain; PDE5Delta1-465 contained the C domain and the C-terminal portion of GAF-B; and PDE5Delta1-534 contained only C domain. Truncated proteins with a complete GAF-B were dimers, but those lacking the N-terminal 46 amino acids of GAF-B were monomers, indicating that these residues are vital for GAF-B-mediated PDE5 dimerization. K(m) values of the mutants for cGMP were similar to that of full-length PDE5. All PDE5 constructs had similar affinities for 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, sildenafil, tadalafil, and UK-122764, but mutants containing a complete GAF-B had 7- to 18-fold higher affinity for vardenafil-based compounds compared with those lacking a complete GAF-B. This indicated that the N-terminal 46 amino acids in GAF-B are required for high vardenafil potency. This is the first evidence that PDE5 R domain, and GAF-B in particular, influences affinity and selectivity of the catalytic site for certain classes of inhibitors.
14734046	Loss of beta-adrenoceptor response in myocytes overexpressing the Na+/Ca(2+)-exchanger.	Increased Na+/Ca(2+)-exchanger (NCX) and altered beta-adrenoceptor (betaAR) responses are observed in failing human heart. To determine the possible interaction between these changes, we investigated the effect of NCX overexpression on responses to isoproterenol in adult rat ventricular myocytes. Responses to isoproterenol were largely mediated through the beta1AR in control myocytes. Adenovirally-mediated overexpression of NCX, at levels, which did not alter basal contraction of myocytes, markedly depressed the isoproterenol concentration-response curve. Responses to isoproterenol could be restored to normal by beta2AR blockade, suggesting a beta2AR-mediated inhibition of beta1AR signalling. Pertussis toxin normalised isoproterenol responses in NCX cells, indicating that beta2AR effects were mediated by Gi. Negative-inotropic effects of high concentrations of ICI 118,551, previously shown to be due to beta2AR-Gi coupling, were increased in NCX cells. We conclude that NCX upregulation can markedly alter the consequences of betaAR stimulation and that this may contribute to the alterations in betaAR response seen in failing human heart.
22917842	High multivitamin intakes during pregnancy and postweaning obesogenic diets interact to affect the relationship between expression of PPAR genes and glucose regulation in the offspring.	High multivitamin intake (HV) during pregnancy increases body fat and weight and alters glucose and fatty acid metabolism in Wistar rat offspring. This study investigated the expression of peroxisome-proliferator activated receptors (PPARs) genes involved in regulation of glucose and fatty acid metabolism in their tissues. Dams received the AIN-93G diet with either the regular (RV) or 10-fold multivitamins (HV) during pregnancy. Male offspring were weaned to either the RV diet (RV-RV and HV-RV) or an obesogenic diet (RV-Ob and HV-Ob). Gene expression of PPARs in tissues was analyzed by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Gestational diet (GD) did not affect PPARs gene expression in offspring at either birth or weaning. In liver, at 14 weeks postweaning, PPAR-γ was 30% lower in the HV-RV and 30% higher in HV-Ob than in the RV-RV group [GD P=.76, postweaning diet (PD) P=.19, interaction P=.02, by two-way analysis of variance]. In muscle, PPAR-α expression was affected by GD and PD (GD P=.05, PD P<.01, interaction P=.07). In adipose tissue, PPAR-α expression was higher in all groups compared to RV-RV (GD P=.25, PD P=.85, interaction P=.03). PPAR-γ mRNA levels correlated with abdominal fat (r=0.45, P<.05) and insulin resistance index (r=0.39, P<.05). In liver, PPAR-γ expression correlated with insulin resistance index in offspring from RV (r=-0.62, P<.05), but not in those from HV dams (r=0.13, P>.05). In conclusion, the HV diet during pregnancy interacts with postweaning diets in determining the expression of PPARs genes in a tissue- and age-dependent manner and uncouples the relationship between these genes and glucose regulation and fat mass in the rat offspring.
17041099	The effect of a novel transition state inhibitor of methylthioadenosine phosphorylase on pemetrexed activity.	Pemetrexed is a new-generation antifolate inhibitor of thymidylate synthase (TS) and a weaker inhibitor of glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase (GARFT) required for de novo purine synthesis. Methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) salvages purines by releasing adenine from methylthioadenosine and is often deleted in mesothelioma. The current study addresses the effect of MTAP on pemetrexed activity using a highly potent transition state inhibitor of MTAP, MT-DADMe-Immucillin A (ImmA; K(i) = 86 pmol/L) in the MTAP(+) NCI-H28 and MTAP(-) NCI-H2052 mesothelioma cell lines. Based on selective nucleoside protection, TS was found to be the primary pemetrexed target in both cell lines with GARFT inhibition requiring 20- to 30-fold higher pemetrexed concentrations. ImmA had no effect on pemetrexed activity but, when thymidine was added, the pemetrexed IC(50) decreased by a factor of approximately 3 in MTAP(+) H28 cells with no effect in MTAP(-) H2052 cells. Conversely, the transfection of MTAP into H2052 cells increased the pemetrexed IC(50) by nearly 3-fold but only in the presence of thymidine; this was reversed by ImmA. An MTAP-specific short interfering RNA produced a 2-fold decrease in pemetrexed IC(50) in MTAP(+) HeLa cells in the presence of thymidine. These data indicate that suppression of constitutive MTAP has no effect on pemetrexed activity when the primary target is TS. There is a modest salutary effect when the pemetrexed target is GARFT alone.
8506307	In vitro and in vivo functional characterization of bovine vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylase expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells.	Coagulation factor IX is a serine protease for which high-level expression of biologically active protein in heterologous cells is limited due to inefficient proteolytic removal of the propeptide as well as vitamin K-dependent carboxylation of multiple amino-terminal glutamic acid residues. We have overexpressed the vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylase cDNA and monitored its ability to improve factor IX processing in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. From amino acid sequence analysis of bovine liver vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylase, degenerate oligonucleotides were used to isolate a 3.5-kbp bovine cDNA that encoded a 758-residue open reading frame. Expression of the cDNA in COS-1 and CHO cells yielded 17- and 16-fold increases in the in vitro gamma-carboxylase activity of microsomal preparations, respectively. Anti-serum raised against a predicted peptide sequence reacted with a 94-kDa polypeptide in the partially purified bovine liver preparation as well as in stably transfected CHO cells. The amount of antibody reactivity correlated with the increased ability to carboxylate a peptide substrate in vitro. These results strongly support the conclusion that the cDNA encodes the vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylase. Transient transfection of the gamma-carboxylase expression vector into factor IX-expressing CHO cells did not improve the specific procoagulant activity of secreted factor IX. In contrast, transfection of an expression vector encoding the propeptide processing enzyme PACE (paired basic amino acid cleaving enzyme) did improve the specific activity of secreted factor IX by 3-fold. These results demonstrate that the ability of CHO cells to modify glutamic acid residues to gamma-carboxyglutamic acid in secreted factor IX is not limited by the expression of the vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylase alone.
23572528	A Role for Cargo in the Activation of ADP-Ribosylation Factors (Arf) and Adaptor Recruitment.	Membrane traffic requires the specific concentration of protein cargos and exclusion of other proteins into nascent carriers. Critical components of this selectivity are the protein adaptors that bind to short, linear motifs in the cytoplasmic tails of transmembrane protein cargos and sequester them into nascent carriers. The recruitment of the adaptors is mediated by activated Arf GTPases and the Arf-adaptor complexes mark sites of carrier formation. However, the nature of the signal(s) that initiate carrier biogenesis remains unknown. We examined the specificity and initial sites of recruitment of Arf-dependent adaptors (AP-1 and GGAs) in response to the Golgi or endosomal localization of specific cargo proteins (furin, mannose-6-phosphate receptor (M6PR) and M6PR lacking a C-terminal domain M6PRΔC). We find that cargo promotes the recruitment of specific adaptors, suggesting that it is part of an upstream signaling event. Cargos do not promote adaptor recruitment to all compartments in which they reside and thus additional factors regulate the cargo's ability to promote Arf activation and adaptor recruitment. We document that within a given compartment different cargos recruit different adaptors suggesting that there is little or no free, activated Arf at the membrane and that Arf activation is spatially and temporally coupled to the cargo and the adaptor. Using temperature block, Brefeldin A, and recovery from each, we found that the cytoplasmic tail of M6PR causes the recruitment of AP-1 and GGAs to recycling endosomes and not at the Golgi, as predicted by steady state staining profiles. These results are discussed with respect to the generation of novel models for cargo-dependent regulation of membrane traffic.
17627474	Regulated function of the prolyl-4-hydroxylase domain (PHD) oxygen sensor proteins.	Cellular oxygen is sensed by prolyl-4-hydroxylase domain (PHD) proteins that hydroxylate hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) alpha subunits. Under normoxic conditions, hydroxylated HIFalpha is bound by the von Hippel-Lindau (pVHL) tumor suppressor, leading to ubiquitinylation and proteasomal degradation. Under hypoxic conditions, hydroxylation becomes reduced, leading to HIFalpha stabilization. The authors recently showed that changes in PHD abundance and activity can regulate HIFalpha stability under normoxic as well as under hypoxic conditions. Thus, the PHD oxygen sensors themselves represent effectors of cellular signalling pathways as well as potential drug targets. Here, a cell-free in vitro microtiter plate-based peptide hydroxylation assay was used to investigate the influence of ferrous iron, Krebs cycle intermediates, transition metals, and vitamin C and other antioxidants on the activity of purified PHD1 to 3. PHD activity depends not only on oxygen availability but is also regulated by iron, vitamin C, and Krebs cycle intermediates, suggesting a physiological relevance of their cellular concentrations. Copper but not iron, cobalt, or nickel salts catalyzed vitamin C oxidation. While vitamin C is essential for PHD activity in vitro, N-acetyl-L-cysteine had no effect, and gallic acid or n-propyl gallate efficiently inhibited the activity of all three PHDs, demonstrating different functions of these antioxidants.
16370964	The effect of antidepressants on glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity: synthesis and mechanisms.	OBJECTIVE: To synthesise results from investigations reporting on the effect of antidepressants on glucose-insulin homeostasis. METHOD: The authors conducted a MedLine search of all English language articles from 1966 to October 2005 using the keywords: bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, diabetes mellitus, glucose homeostasis, and the name of each antidepressant that has been indicated for major depression in Canada and the US up to October 2005. The search was supplemented with a manual review of relevant references. Both preclinical and clinical investigations were reviewed. RESULTS: Some serotonergic antidepressants (e.g., fluoxetine) reduce hyperglycaemia, normalise glucose homeostasis and increase insulin sensitivity, whereas some noradrenergic antidepressants (e.g., desipramine) exert opposite effects. Dual-mechanism antidepressants (e.g., duloxetine and venlafaxine) do not appear to disrupt glucose homeostatic dynamics, whereas nonselective hydrazine monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., phenelzine) are associated with hypoglycaemia and an increased glucose disposal rate. CONCLUSION: Some antidepressants exert a clinically significant effect on metabolism relevant to both therapeutic outcome and adverse events.
15982930	Thalidomide inhibits growth of tumors through COX-2 degradation independent of antiangiogenesis.	Thalidomide is an antiangiogenic drug and is clinically useful in a number of cancers. However, the molecular mechanism by which thalidomide exerts its antitumor effects is poorly understood. This study was designed to clarify the relationship between antiangiogenesis and antitumor effects of thalidomide and to explore the molecular mechanism for its antitumor activity. We evaluated the effects of thalidomide on the growth of human tumor cells expressing (MCF-7 and HL-60) or not expressing (HeLa and K562) COX-2 in vitro. We also studied the effects of thalidomide on COX-1, COX-2 or bcl-2 expression, TNFalpha, VEGF, GSH and cytochrome c in these cells. Thalidomide could inhibit tumor growth in a concentration-dependent manner in MCF-7 and HL-60; its IC50s for them were 18.36+/-2.34 and 22.14+/-2.15 microM, respectively, while this effect was not observed in HeLa and K562. Thalidomide reduced COX-2 expression accompanied by a decrease of bcl-2 protein, TNFalpha, VEGF, GSH and an increased cytochrome c, but had no effect on that of COX-1, in MCF-7 and HL-60. Moreover, cells not expressing COX-2 were insensitive to the growth-inhibitory and effects on cytokines of thalidomide. In our mouse xenograft model of OVCAR-3 and HCT-8, we found that thalidomide could decrease intratumoral microvessel density in both tumors; it exerted antitumor effects only on OVCAR-3 expressing COX-2 but did not on HCT-8 not expressing COX-2. Effect of thalidomide on COX-1 and COX-2 in vivo was consistent with that of in vitro. These results demonstrated that thalidomide might inhibit growth of tumors through COX-2 degradation independent of antiangiogenesis.
23459442	COMT Val158Met modulates subjective responses to intravenous nicotine and cognitive performance in abstinent smokers.	The catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val158Met polymorphism may be a risk factor for nicotine addiction. This study examined the influence of the COMT Val158Met polymorphism on subjective, physiological and cognitive effects of intravenous (IV) nicotine use in African Americans (AAs; n=56) and European Americans (EAs; n=68) smokers. Overnight abstinent smokers received saline followed by 0.5 and 1.0 mg per 70 kg doses of nicotine, administered 30 min apart. Smokers with valine (Val)/Val genotype, compared with methionine (Met) carriers, had greater negative subjective effects from IV nicotine and had more severe withdrawal severity following overnight abstinence from smoking. Women with Val/Val genotype reported greater difficulty concentrating and irritability than men with Val/Val or Met carrier genotypes. The Val/Val genotype was associated with better performance on the math task and in AA smokers it was associated with greater systolic blood pressure. These results support the rationale of pharmacologically inhibiting COMT to aid with smoking cessation among Val/Val genotype smokers.The Pharmacogenomics Journal advance online publication, 5 March 2013; doi:10.1038/tpj.2013.1.
23353026	Oxidative stress involvement in manganese-induced alpha-synuclein oligomerization in organotypic brain slice cultures.	Overexposure to manganese (Mn) has been known to induce neuronal damage. However, little is known of the role that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play in protein aggregation resulting from Mn exposure. The current study investigated whether oxidative stress is involved in manganese-induced alpha-synuclein oligomerization in organotypic brain slices. After application of Mn (0-400μM) for 24h, there was a dose-dependent increase in average percentage of propidium iodide positive (PI(+)) nuclei in slices and levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the culture medium. Moreover, the treatment with Mn resulted in a dose-dependent increase in neurocyte apoptosis, ROS level, and decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Mn also caused oxidative damage in cell lipid and protein. At the same time, the exposure of Mn leaded to significantly increase in the expression of alpha-synuclein mRNA and protein. Alpha-synuclein oligomerization occurred in Mn-treated slices, especially on membrane-bound form. It indicated that alpha-synuclein oligomers were more likely to combination cell membranes and resulting in membrane damage. Mn-induced neurocyte damage and alpha-synuclein oligomerization were also partially alleviated by the pretreatment with GSH and aggravated by H2O2 pretreatment. The findings revealed Mn might exert its neurotoxic effects by oxidative stress-mediated alpha-synuclein oligomerization in organotypic brain slices.
22836881	Hospitalized osteoporotic vertebral fracture increases the risk of stroke: a population-based cohort study.	The association between osteoporosis and cardiovascular diseases has been demonstrated. Higher cardiovascular risk has also been correlated with vertebral fractures. However, the association between osteoporotic vertebral fracture and the possibly higher risk of stroke remains uncertain. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence, risk, and type of stroke in patients with osteoporotic vertebral fracture. Patients with osteoporotic vertebral fracture were identified (n = 380) and 10 age- and sex-matched controls per case (comparison group, n = 3795) were chosen from a nationwide representative cohort of 999,997 people from 1998 to 2005. Both groups were followed-up for stroke events for 3 years, matched by propensity scores with adjustments for covariates such as comorbidities (ie, hypertension, diabetes, arrhythmia, or coronary heart diseases) and exposure to medications (ie, aspirin, lipid lowering drug, or nitrates), and assessed by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses. The incidence rate of stroke in the osteoporotic vertebral fracture group (37.5 per 1000 person-years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 27.5-51.2) was significantly higher than in the comparison group (14.0 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 12.0-16.4, p < 0.001). Stroke was more likely to occur in the osteoporotic vertebral fracture patients than in the normal controls (crude hazard ratio [HR] 2.68, 95% CI 1.89-3.79, p < 0.001; adjusted HR 2.71, 95% CI 1.90-3.86, p < 0.001). In conclusion, patients with osteoporotic vertebral fracture have a higher risk of stroke (ie, both ischemic and hemorrhagic) and require stroke prevention strategies.
23230132	Involvement of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases UGT1A9 and UGT2B7 in ethanol glucuronidation, and interactions with common drugs of abuse.	Ethyl glucuronide (EtG) determination is increasingly used in clinical and forensic toxicology to document ethanol consumption. The enzymes involved in EtG production, as well as potential interactions with common drugs of abuse, have not been extensively studied. Activities of human liver (HLM), kidney (HKM), and intestinal (HIM) microsomes, as well as of 12 major human recombinant UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), toward ethanol (50 and 500 mM) were evaluated in vitro using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Enzyme kinetic parameters were determined for pooled microsomes and recombinant UGTs with significant activity. Individual contributions of UGTs were estimated using the relative activity factor approach, proposed for scaling activities obtained with cDNA-expressed enzymes to HLM. Interaction of morphine, codeine, lorazepam, oxazepam, nicotine, cotinine, cannabinol, and cannabidiol (5, 10, 15 mg/l) with ethanol (1.15, 4.6, 11.5 g/l; i.e., 25, 100, 250 mM) glucuronidation was assessed using pooled HLM. Ethanol glucuronidation intrinsic clearance (Cl(int)) was 4 and 12.7 times higher for HLM than for HKM and HIM, respectively. All recombinant UGTs, except UGT1A1, 1A6, and 1A10, produced EtG in detectable amounts. UGT1A9 and 2B7 were the most active enzymes, each accounting for 17 and 33% of HLM Cl(int), respectively. Only cannabinol and cannabidiol significantly affected ethanol glucuronidation. Cannabinol increased ethanol glucuronidation in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas cannabidiol significantly inhibited EtG formation in a noncompetitive manner (IC(50) = 1.17 mg/l; inhibition constant (K(i)) = 3.1 mg/l). UGT1A9 and 2B7 are the main enzymes involved in ethanol glucuronidation. In addition, our results suggest that cannabinol and cannabidiol could significantly alter ethanol glucuronidation.
19496999	Dopamine D2/3 receptor binding potential and occupancy in midbrain and temporal cortex by haloperidol, olanzapine and clozapine.	AIMS: Aberrant dopamine transmission in extrastriatal brain regions has been repeatedly illustrated among patients with schizophrenia. Differences between typical and second-generation antipsychotics in dopamine D(2) receptor modulation within various brain areas remain a topic for debate. The aim of the present study was therefore to investigate dopamine D(2/3) receptor apparent binding potential (BP(app)) and occupancy in midbrain and temporal cortex among clozapine-, olanzapine- and haloperidol-treated schizophrenia patients. METHODS: Dopamine D(2/3) binding was studied on single-photon emission computed tomography ligand [(123)I]epidepride in 13 schizophrenia patients treated with medication (two with haloperidol, four with olanzapine and seven with clozapine), six drug-naive patients and seven healthy controls. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences in midbrain dopamine D(2/3) receptor BP(app) (P = 0.015) and occupancy (P = 0.016) were observed between the clozapine, olanzapine and haloperidol groups. The lowest occupancy was found in clozapine-treated patients (5%), followed by olanzapine-treated patients (28%), compared to haloperidol-treated patients (40%). No significant differences were observed in the temporal poles. Occupancy changed substantially depending on the comparison group used (either drug-naive vs healthy controls) in the examined brain areas (P = 0.001), showing an overestimation with all antipsychotics when the healthy control group was used. CONCLUSION: Both typical and second-generation antipsychotics occupy cortical dopamine D(2/3) receptors, thus mediating therapeutic efficacy. Observed differences in midbrain dopamine D(2/3) occupancy between classical antipsychotics and second-generation antipsychotics may have clinical relevance by modulating altered nigrostriatal dopamine neurotransmission during the acute phase of schizophrenia.
17194716	Three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship analysis of human CYP51 inhibitors.	CYP51 fulfills an essential requirement for all cells, by catalyzing three sequential mono-oxidations within the cholesterol biosynthesis cascade. Inhibition of fungal CYP51 is used as a therapy for treating fungal infections, whereas inhibition of human CYP51 has been considered as a pharmacological approach to treat dyslipidemia and some forms of cancer. To predict the interaction of inhibitors with the active site of human CYP51, a three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship model was constructed. This pharmacophore model of the common structural features of CYP51 inhibitors was built using the program Catalyst from multiple inhibitors (n = 26) of recombinant human CYP51-mediated lanosterol 14alpha-demethylation. The pharmacophore, which consisted of one hydrophobe, one hydrogen bond acceptor, and two ring aromatic features, demonstrated a high correlation between observed and predicted IC(50) values (r = 0.92). Validation of this pharmacophore was performed by predicting the IC(50) of a test set of commercially available (n = 19) and CP-320626-related (n = 48) CYP51 inhibitors. Using predictions below 10 microM as a cutoff indicative of active inhibitors, 16 of 19 commercially available inhibitors (84%) and 38 of 48 CP-320626-related inhibitors (79.2%) were predicted correctly. To better understand how inhibitors fit into the enzyme, potent CYP51 inhibitors were used to build a Cerius(2) receptor surface model representing the volume of the active site. This study has demonstrated the potential for ligand-based computational pharmacophore modeling of human CYP51 and enables a high-throughput screening system for drug discovery and data base mining.
7952157	Diagnosis and treatment of thyrotoxicosis in childhood. A European questionnaire study.	A covering letter and a questionnaire covering the diagnosis and treatment of thyrotoxicosis in childhood was circulated between October 1992 and February 1993 amongst 672 European members of the European Thyroid Association (ETA) and members of the European Society for Pediatric Endocrinology (ESPE). Almost 50% replied to the letter and 99 individuals or groups from 22 countries completed the questionnaire. A consensus was reached on the use of total thyroxine (T4) and/or free T4 and thyrotropin as routine diagnostic tools. Two-thirds included total triiodothyronine (T3) and/or free T3 and 32% used a thyrotropin-releasing hormone test. Surprisingly, thyroglobulin autoantibodies were used as a routine test by 78%; 63% included thyrotropin receptor antibodies and 60% microsomal antibodies, whereas only 50% measured thyroperoxidase antibodies. For thyroid imaging, 40% performed a thyroid scintigram and 56% measured the size of the thyroid gland by ultrasound. Antithyroid drugs (ATD) were the basic initial treatment of choice given by 99% of the respondents for children with uncomplicated Graves' disease. Carbimazole, methimazole and thiamazole were the most frequently used drugs, with a median initial dose of 0.8 mg.kg-1.day-1. Two-thirds added beta-blockers and a few used sedatives. The ATD dose was adjusted for each patient by 39%, whereas 56% combined ATD with T4 for long-term treatment; 84% gave treatment for a fixed period (44% for 1-2 years). Surgery was considered the treatment of choice in children with an adenoma (83%), with a nodular (53%) or large goiter (16%) and recurrence after ATD (14%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
23353901	Support for 5-HT2C receptor functional selectivity in vivo utilizing structurally diverse, selective 5-HT2C receptor ligands and the 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine elicited head-twitch response model.	There are seemingly conflicting data in the literature regarding the role of serotonin (5-HT) 5-HT2C receptors in the mouse head-twitch response (HTR) elicited by the hallucinogenic 5-HT2A/2B/2C receptor agonist 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI). Namely, both 5-HT2C receptor agonists and antagonists, regarding 5-HT2C receptor-mediated Gq-phospholipase C (PLC) signaling, reportedly attenuate the HTR response. The present experiments tested the hypothesis that both classes of 5-HT2C receptor compounds could attenuate the DOI-elicited-HTR in a single strain of mice, C57Bl/6J. The expected results were considered in accordance with ligand functional selectivity. Commercially-available 5-HT2C agonists (CP 809101, Ro 60-0175, WAY 161503, mCPP, and 1-methylpsilocin), novel 4-phenyl-2-N,N-dimethyl-aminotetralin (PAT)-type 5-HT2C agonists (with 5-HT2A/2B antagonist activity), and antagonists selective for 5-HT2A (M100907), 5-HT2C (SB-242084), and 5-HT2B/2C (SB-206553) receptors attenuated the DOI-elicited-HTR. In contrast, there were differential effects on locomotion across classes of compounds. The 5-HT2C agonists and M100907 decreased locomotion, SB-242084 increased locomotion, SB-206553 resulted in dose-dependent biphasic effects on locomotion, and the PATs did not alter locomotion. In vitro molecular pharmacology studies showed that 5-HT2C agonists potent for attenuating the DOI-elicited-HTR also reduced the efficacy of DOI to activate mouse 5-HT2C receptor-mediated PLC signaling in HEK cells. Although there were differences in affinities of a few compounds at mouse compared to human 5-HT2A or 5-HT2C receptors, all compounds tested retained their selectivity for either receptor, regardless of receptor species. Results indicate that 5-HT2C receptor agonists and antagonists attenuate the DOI-elicited-HTR in C57Bl/6J mice, and suggest that structurally diverse 5-HT2C ligands result in different 5-HT2C receptor signaling outcomes compared to DOI.
23519392	Pregnane X Receptor Mediates Dyslipidemia Induced by the HIV Protease Inhibitor Amprenavir in Mice.	HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) have been used successfully in extending the lifespan of people infected with HIV. The use of PIs has also been associated with dyslipidemia and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Several PIs have been implicated to activate the nuclear receptor pregnane X receptor (PXR), which acts as a xenobiotic sensor to regulate xenobiotic metabolism in the liver and intestine. Recent studies indicate that PXR may also play an important role in the regulation of lipid homeostasis. In the present study, we identified amprenavir, a widely used HIV PI, as a potent PXR-selective agonist. Computational docking studies combined with site-direct mutagenesis identified several key residues within the ligand binding pocket of PXR that constitute points of interaction with amprenavir. Amprenavir efficiently activated PXR and induced PXR target gene expression in vitro and in vivo. Short-term exposure to amprenavir significantly increased plasma total cholesterol and atherogenic low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in wild-type mice, but not in PXR-deficient mice. Amprenavir-mediated PXR activation stimulated the expression of several key intestinal genes involved in lipid homeostasis. These findings provide critical mechanistic insight for understanding the impact of PIs on cardiovascular disease and demonstrate a potential role of PXR in mediating adverse effects of HIV PIs in humans.
23485651	Cadmium telluride quantum dots cause oxidative stress leading to extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells.	The mechanisms of toxicity related to human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cell exposures to cadmium telluride quantum dots (CdTe-QDs) were investigated. CdTe-QDs caused cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Treated cells showed an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS). Altered antioxidant levels were demonstrated by depletion of reduced glutathione (GSH), a decreased ratio of reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) and an increased NF-E2-related Factor 2 (Nrf2) activation. Enzyme assays showed that superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was elevated whereas catalase (CAT) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities were depressed. Further analyses revealed that CdTe-QD exposure resulted in apoptosis, indicated by changes in levels of caspase-3 activity, poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage and phosphatidylserine externalization. Extrinsic apoptotic pathway markers such as Fas levels and caspase-8 activity increased as a result of CdTe-QD exposure. Involvement of the intrinsic/mitochondrial apoptotic pathway was indicated by decreased levels of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) protein and mitochondrial cytochrome c, and by increased levels of mitochondrial Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and cytosolic cytochrome c. Further, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) such as c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erk1/2), and p38 were all activated. Our findings reveal that CdTe-QDs cause oxidative stress, interfere with antioxidant defenses and activate protein kinases, leading to apoptosis via both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Since the effects of CdTe-QDs on selected biomarkers were similar or greater compared to those of CdCl2 at equivalent concentrations of cadmium, the study suggests that the toxicity of CdTe-QDs arises from a combination of the effects of cadmium and ROS generated from the NPs.
12063084	The antipsychotic aripiprazole is a potent, partial agonist at the human 5-HT1A receptor.	Aripiprazole, 7-[4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-1-piperazinyl]butyloxy]-3,4-dihydro-2(1H)-quinolinon e, a novel antipsychotic with partial agonist activity at dopamine D2 receptors, bound with high affinity to recombinant human 5-HT(1A) receptors (h5-HT(1A)) in Chinese hamster ovary cell membranes and displayed potent, partial agonism at 5-HT(1A) receptors in a guanosine-5'-O-(3-[(35)S]thio)-triphosphate ([(35)S]GTP gamma S)-binding assay that was blocked completely by a selective 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist. An interaction with 5-HT(1A) receptors may contribute to the overall efficacy of aripiprazole against symptoms of schizophrenia, including anxiety, depression, cognitive and negative symptoms, and to its favorable side-effect profile. Combined with previous studies demonstrating the potent partial agonism of aripiprazole at dopamine D2 receptors, this study suggests aripiprazole is the first dopamine-serotonin system stabilizer.
23571427	Stereoselective Glucuronidation of Ornidazole in Humans: Predominant Contribution of UDP-Glucuronosyltransferases 1A9 and 2B7.	Ornidazole [R,S-1-chloro-3-(2-methyl-5-nitro-1H-imidazol-1-yl)propan-2-ol] is a chiral 5-nitroimidazole class antimicrobial agent. This study aimed to investigate the principal metabolic pathway of ornidazole in humans and identify the major enzymes involved. A total of 19 metabolites were identified in human urine collected from patients with hepatobiliary diseases after an intravenous drip infusion of 500 mg of racemic ornidazole. Stereoselective glucuronidation, followed by renal excretion, was the principal metabolic pathway of ornidazole in humans, accounting for 37.3% of the administered dose. Screening assays with 12 available human recombinant UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) demonstrated that UGT1A9 was the predominant UGT isoform involved in R-ornidazole glucuronidation, whereas S-ornidazole glucuronidation was almost exclusively catalyzed by UGT2B7. Chemical inhibition study with niflumic acid and flurbiprofen supported these findings. Enzyme kinetic parameters were then determined in human liver microsomes (HLMs), human kidney microsomes (HKMs), UGT1A9 and 2B7. The Km values for UGT1A9 (15.6 ± 1.6 mM for R-ornidazole) and 2B7 (3.8 ± 0.9 mM for S-ornidazole) were quite similar to those determined in HLMs and HKMs (20.1 ± 1.4 and 17.7 ± 4.0 mM for R-ornidazole; 6.6 ± 1.3 and 3.2 ± 0.4 mM for S-ornidazole). The in vitro intrinsic clearance (CLint) ratios of S- and R-ornidazole were approximately 4.3 in HLMs and 6.5 in HKMs, respectively. The hepatic and renal clearances were estimated based on the well-stirred model. Overall, stereoselective glucuronidation was the principal metabolic pathway of ornidazole in humans. Furthermore, UGT1A9 and 2B7 were the predominant UGT isoforms responsible for R- and S-ornidazole glucuronidation in humans, respectively.
12545203	Up-regulation of spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) expression is a part of proliferative but not anabolic response of mouse kidney.	A differential expression pattern of spermidine/spermine N(1)-acetyltransferase (SSAT), the enzyme critical to proper homeostasis of cellular polyamines, is reported in mouse kidney undergoing hyperplasia and hypertrophy. We have shown that SSAT activity and SSAT mRNA are significantly induced by antifolate CB 3717 and folate that evoke a drug-injury-dependent hyperplasia. In contrast, SSAT activity is down-regulated in the testosterone-induced hypertrophic kidney, while SSAT mRNA is positively controlled by this androgen. Catecholamine depletion evoked by reserpine drastically decreases the folate-induced activity of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC), which limits polyamine biosynthesis, but has no effect on SSAT activity augmented by CB 3717. Our results document that the increased SSAT expression solely accompanies the proliferative response of mouse kidney, and suggest the importance of post-transcriptional regulation to the control of SSAT activity in both hyperplastic and hypertrophic experimental models.
23404443	Effects of induced hyperinsulinaemia with and without hyperglycaemia on measures of cardiac vagal control.	AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We examined the effects of serum insulin levels on vagal control over the heart and tested the hypothesis that higher fasting insulin levels are associated with lower vagal control. We also examined whether experimentally induced increases in insulin by beta cell secretagogues, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), will decrease vagal control. METHODS: Respiration and ECGs were recorded for 130 healthy participants undergoing clamps. Three variables of cardiac vagal effects (the root mean square of successive differences [rMSSD] in the interbeat interval of the heart rate [IBI], heart-rate variability [HRV] caused by peak-valley respiratory sinus arrhythmia [pvRSA], and high-frequency power [HF]) and heart rate (HR) were obtained at seven time points during the clamps, characterised by increasing levels of insulin (achieved by administering insulin plus glucose, glucose only, glucose and GLP-1, and glucose and GLP-1 combined with arginine). RESULTS: Serum insulin level was positively associated with HR at all time points during the clamps except the first-phase hyperglycaemic clamp. Insulin levels were negatively correlated with variables of vagal control, reaching significance for rMSSD and log(10)HF, but not for pvRSA, during the last four phases of the hyperglycaemic clamp (hyperglycaemic second phase, GLP-1 first and second phases, and arginine). These associations disappeared when adjusted for age, BMI and insulin sensitivity. Administration of the beta cell secretagogues GLP-1 and arginine led to a significant increase in HR, but this was not paired with a significant reduction in HRV measures. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Experimentally induced hyperinsulinaemia is not correlated with cardiac vagal control or HR when adjusting for age, BMI and insulin sensitivity index. Our findings suggest that exposure to a GLP-1 during hyperglycaemia leads to a small acute increase in HR but not to an acute decrease in cardiac vagal control.
23337567	Osteoblasts survive the arsenic trioxide treatment by activation of ATM-mediated pathway.	Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is widely used in tumor treatment, but excessive arsenic exposure can have adverse effects. We recently found that, in primary osteoblasts, ATO produces oxidative stress and causes DNA tailing, but does not induce apoptosis. We further examined the signaling pathway by which osteoblasts survive ATO treatment, and found that they were arrested at G2/M phase of the cell cycle at 30h and overrode the G2/M boundary at 48h. After treatment for 30h, there was increased Cdc2 phosphorylation and expression of Wee1, a Cdc2 kinase, and expression of the cell cycle inhibitor, p21(waf1/cip1), which interacts with Cdc2. Furthermore, levels of the phosphatase Cdc25C, which activates Cdc2, were decreased, while the ratio of its phosphorylated/inactivated form to the total amount was increased. Moreover, phosphorylation/activation of the checkpoint kinases Chk1, Chk2 and p53 levels were increased, as were levels of activated ATM and γ-H2AX. The cell viability was decreased as an ATM inhibitor was added. Additionally, these effects of ATO on γ-H2AX, Chk1, Chk2, p53, and p21(waf1/cip1) were reduced by an ATM inhibitor. These findings suggest that G2/M phase arrest of osteoblasts is mediated by Chk1/Chk2 activation via an ATM-dependent pathway by which osteoblasts survive.
23151001	Regulation of G protein-coupled receptor kinases by phospholipids.	G protein coupled-receptor (GPCR) kinases (GRKs) initiate the deactivation of GPCRs by phosphorylating their cytoplasmic loops and C-terminal tails. They are regulated not only by allosteric interactions with activated GPCRs, but also by the membrane environment itself. Herein we describe how the various GRKs are recruited to lipid bilayers and, where evident, how specific anionic phospholipids help regulate their activity. Using crystal structures representing each of the three vertebrate GRK subfamilies, we map the lipid binding sites in order to better understand how these enzymes are oriented at the cell surface. This analysis suggests that GRKs bind lipid and active GPCRs in a coordinated manner.
23602986	Neuroactive effects of cotinine on the hippocampus: Behavioral and biochemical parameters.	The present work evaluated the effects of nicotine (NIC), cotinine (COT), mecamylamine (MEC), methyllycaconitine (MLA) and dihydro-beta-eritroidine (DHβE) on memory extinction and the following biochemical parameters of the hippocampus: lipid peroxidation (LPO), antioxidant capacity (AC) and the phosphorylation of Extracellular-Signal-Regulated Kinase (ERK 1/2). Young male rats that were implanted bilaterally with cannulae were submitted to memory extinction tests sessions, and their hippocampi were dissected for biochemical assays. The extinction of fear memory was significantly improved by both nicotine and its metabolite. Cotinine significantly increased LPO, while nicotine significantly decreased it. Antioxidant capacity was increased by all treatments. Our results showed that cotinine, unlike nicotine, may increase oxidative stress in the hippocampus, but this increase depends upon the dose used and happens without causing corresponding impairments in cognitive function. Cotinine also increased the phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 in a similar fashion as nicotine. Considering these results, it is plausible to wonder to what extent nicotine-attributed effects are really due to the actions of this alkaloid and whether they could be due instead to cotinine or to cotinine-nicotine interactions within the brain.
8755512	Binding of thalidomide to alpha1-acid glycoprotein may be involved in its inhibition of tumor necrosis factor alpha production.	In addition to its well known sedative and teratogenic effects, thalidomide also possesses potent immunomodulatory and antiinflammatory activities, being most effective against leprosy and chronic graft-versus-host disease. The immunomodulatory activity of thalidomide has been ascribed to the selective inhibition of tumor necrosis factor alpha from monocytes. The molecular mechanism for the immunomodulatory effect of thalidomide remains unknown. To elucidate this mechanism, we synthesized an active photoaffinity label of thalidomide as a probe to identify the molecular target of the drug. Using the probe, we specifically labeled a pair of proteins of 43-45 kDa with high acidity from bovine thymus extract. Purification of these proteins and partial peptide sequence determination revealed them to be alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AGP). We show that the binding of thalidomide photoaffinity label to authentic human AGP is competed with both thalidomide and the nonradioactive photoaffinity label at concentrations comparable to those required for inhibition of production of tumor necrosis factor alpha from human monocytes, suggesting that AGP may be involved in the immunomodulatory activity of thalidomide.
17015480	TReP-132 is a novel progesterone receptor coactivator required for the inhibition of breast cancer cell growth and enhancement of differentiation by progesterone.	The sex steroid progesterone is essential for the proliferation and differentiation of the mammary gland epithelium during pregnancy. In relation to this, in vitro studies using breast carcinoma T47D cells have demonstrated a biphasic progesterone response, consisting of an initial proliferative burst followed by a sustained growth arrest. However, the transcriptional factors acting with the progesterone receptor (PR) to mediate the progesterone effects on mammary cell growth and differentiation remain to be determined. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the transcriptional regulating protein of 132 kDa (TReP-132), initially identified as a regulator of steroidogenesis, is also a cell growth suppressor. Similar to progesterone-bound PR, TReP-132 acts by inducing the gene expression of the G1 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21WAF1/Cip1 (p21) and p27Kip1 (p27). The putative interaction between TReP-132 and progesterone pathways in mammary cells was therefore analyzed in the present study. Our results show that TReP-132 interacts in vitro and in T47D cells with progesterone-activated PR. TReP-132 synergizes with progesterone-bound PR to trans activate the p21 and p27 gene promoters at proximal Sp1-binding sites. Moreover, TReP-132 overexpression and knockdown, respectively, increased or prevented the induction of p21 and p27 gene expression by progesterone. As a consequence, TReP-132 knockdown also resulted in the loss of the inhibitory effects of progesterone on pRB phosphorylation, G1/S cell cycle progression, and cell proliferation. Furthermore, the knockdown of TReP-132 expression also prevented the induction of both early and terminal markers of breast cell differentiation which had been previously identified as progesterone target genes. As well, the progesterone-induced accumulation of lipid vacuoles was inhibited in the TReP-132-depleted cells. Finally, TReP-132 gene expression levels increased following progesterone treatment, indicating the existence of a positive auto-regulatory loop between PR and TReP-132. Taken together, these data identify TReP-132 as a coactivator of PR mediating the growth-inhibitory and differentiation effects of progesterone on breast cancer cells.
20541672	Hormonal therapy of prostate cancer.	Of all cancers, prostate cancer is the most sensitive to hormones: it is thus very important to take advantage of this unique property and to always use optimal androgen blockade when hormone therapy is the appropriate treatment. A fundamental observation is that the serum testosterone concentration only reflects the amount of testosterone of testicular origin which is released in the blood from which it reaches all tissues. Recent data show, however, that an approximately equal amount of testosterone is made from dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) directly in the peripheral tissues, including the prostate, and does not appear in the blood. Consequently, after castration, the 95-97% fall in serum testosterone does not reflect the 40-50% testosterone (testo) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) made locally in the prostate from DHEA of adrenal origin. In fact, while elimination of testicular androgens by castration alone has never been shown to prolong life in metastatic prostate cancer, combination of castration (surgical or medical with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist) with a pure anti-androgen has been the first treatment shown to prolong life. Most importantly, when applied at the localized stage, the same combined androgen blockade (CAB) can provide long-term control or cure of the disease in more than 90% of cases. Obviously, since prostate cancer usually grows and metastasizes without signs or symptoms, screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is absolutely needed to diagnose prostate cancer at an 'early' stage before metastasis occurs and the cancer becomes non-curable. While the role of androgens was believed to have become non-significant in cancer progressing under any form of androgen blockade, recent data have shown increased expression of the androgen receptor (AR) in treatment-resistant disease with a benefit of further androgen blockade. Since the available anti-androgens have low affinity for AR and cannot block androgen action completely, especially in the presence of increased AR levels, it becomes important to discover more potent and purely antagonistic blockers of AR. The data obtained with compounds under development are promising. While waiting for this (these) new anti-androgen(s), combined treatment with castration and a pure anti-androgen (bicalutamide, flutamide or nilutamide) is the only available and the best scientifically based means of treating prostate cancer by hormone therapy at any stage of the disease with the optimal chance of success and even cure in localized disease.
23471964	Tumor-suppressive Maspin Functions as a Reactive Oxygen Species Scavenger: IMPORTANCE OF CYSTEINE RESIDUES.	Maspin is a member of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) superfamily and displays tumor-suppressing activity by controlling cell migration, proliferation, apoptosis, and adhesion. Here, we provide evidence that maspin acts as a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger through oxidation of three structurally exposed cysteine thiols to sulfenic acid. Ablation of these cysteine residues in maspin resulted in a significant increase in total ROS production in mouse mammary TM40D cells. Also, cells containing a triple-cysteine mutant of maspin showed elevated ERK1/2 activity, a downstream target of ROS, and enhanced proliferation and colony formation. These findings establish a novel mechanism by which maspin utilizes its cysteine thiols to inhibit oxidative stress and cell growth.
12720300	Defective processing of the transforming growth factor-beta1 in azoxymethane-induced mouse colon tumors.	High levels of the cell growth inhibitor transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) are often found in a variety of human cancers. However, the physiological significance of this overexpression depends on the availability of the biologically active form of TGF-beta1 within the extracellular matrix of the tumor microenvironment. To determine the expression and activation status of TGF-beta1 in chemically induced tumors, 6-wk-old A/J mice were injected intraperitoneally with either azoxymethane (AOM) (10 mg/kg body weight, once a week for 6 wk) or normal saline solution, and colon tumors were isolated 24 wk following the last injection. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for TGF-beta1 revealed a significant increase (1.7-fold, P < 0.05) in total TGF-beta1 protein in tumors. Interestingly, while 80% of the total TGF-beta1 in the control colon tissues was in the active form, only 50% was found to be active in tumors. Together with our earlier observations that TGF-beta1 mRNA levels are unchanged in A/J tumors, these data further support a mechanism whereby elevated TGF-beta1 levels result from a defective activation and turnover of this protein. Because plasmin is known to be a major activator of TGF-beta1 in vivo, we hypothesized that reduced plasmin activity may be responsible for the observed dysregulation of TGF-beta1 processing in these behaviorally benign tumors. With a fluorogenic peptide substrate for serine proteases, a deficiency in plasmin activity was found in the tumors. Furthermore, semiquantitative reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of a panel of genes involved in the plasminogen activation system, including plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), urokinase-plasminogen activator (u-PA), and urokinase-receptor (u-PAR-1), demonstrated a significant upregulation (approximately fourfold to sixfold, P < 0.05) in the expression of each of these genes in the tumor tissue. In addition, no significant changes were observed in the expression levels of thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) and insulin-like growth factor type II receptor (IGF-IIR), which also mediate the activation of latent TGF-beta1. To gain further insight into the functionality of the TGF-beta1 pathway, cDNA microarrays were performed and the expression levels of a panel of 21 TGF-beta1-specific target genes were determined in AOM-induced tumors that overexpress the ligand. A significant dysregulation in the expression of each of these targets was observed, providing evidence of aberrant TGF-beta1 signaling in tumors. Overall, the present study demonstrates a very low plasmin activity in A/J colon tumors, possibly as a result of the potent inhibitory effect of PAI-1 on the plasminogen activation cascade. The observed deficiency in plasmin activity may not be sufficiently compensated for by other mechanisms of latent TGF-beta1 activation, including TSP-1 and IGF-IIR, thereby resulting in a decreased fraction of the biologically active form of TGF-beta1 and subsequent aberration in TGF-beta1-specific gene regulation in A/J tumors.
17289086	Effect of long-term fluoxetine treatment on the human serotonin transporter in Caco-2 cells.	Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) broadly used in the treatment of human mood disorders and gastrointestinal diseases involving the serotoninergic system. The effectiveness of this therapy depends on repeated long-term treatment. Most of the long-term studies in vivo of SSRI effects on serotoninergic activity have focused on their effects on autoreceptors or postsynaptic receptors. The chronic effect of SSRIs on the activity of the serotonin transporter (SERT) has been less studied and the results have been contradictory. The aim of this study was to determine the specific effect of long-term fluoxetine treatment on human serotonin transporter (hSERT) in vitro, by using the human enterocyte-like cell line Caco-2. Results show that fluoxetine diminished the 5-HT uptake in a concentration-dependent way and that this effect was reversible. Fluoxetine affected mainly the hSERT transport rate by reducing the availability of the transporter in the membrane with no significant alteration of either the total hSERT protein content or the hSERT mRNA level. These results suggest that the effect of fluoxetine on the expression of hSERT is post-translational and has shown itself to be independent of PKC and PKA activity. This study may be useful to clarify the effect of the long-term fluoxetine therapy in both gastrointestinal and central nervous system disorders.
23543737	Loss of Calcium/Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase II Activity in Cortical Astrocytes Decreases Glutamate Uptake and Induces Neurotoxic Release of ATP.	The extent of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) inactivation in the brain following ischemia correlates with the extent of damage. We have previously shown that a loss of CaMKII activity in neurons is detrimental to neuronal viability by inducing excitotoxic glutamate release. In the current study, we extend these findings to show that the ability of astrocytes to buffer extracellular glutamate is reduced when CaMKII is inhibited. Furthermore, CaMKII inhibition in astrocytes is associated with the rapid onset of intracellular calcium oscillations. Surprisingly, this rapid calcium influx is blocked by the N-type calcium channel antagonist, omega-conotoxin. While the function of N-type calcium channels within astrocytes is controversial, these voltage-gated calcium channels have been linked to calcium-dependent vesicular gliotransmitter release. When extracellular glutamate and ATP levels are measured following CaMKII inhibition within our enriched astrocyte cultures, no alterations in glutamate levels are observed, whereas ATP levels in the extracellular environment significantly increase. Extracellular ATP accumulation associated with CaMKII inhibition contributes both to calcium oscillations within astrocytes and ultimately cortical neuron toxicity. Thus, a loss of CaMKII signaling within astrocytes dysregulates glutamate uptake and supports ATP release, two processes that would compromise neuronal survival following ischemic/excitotoxic insults.
20372850	Immunohistochemical characterization of pyrimidine synthetic enzymes, thymidine kinase-1 and thymidylate synthase, in various types of cancer.	Thymidine kinase-1 (TK-1) and thymidylate synthase (TS) are key enzymes for salvage and de novo pyrimidine synthesis, respectively. Numerous studies have suggested that increased TS levels are associated closely with resistance to fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. TAS-102 is a novel drug containing trifluorothymidine, which is phosphorylated by TK-1 to its active monophosphated form, that in turn can inhibit TS. TAS-102 has been shown to exhibit antitumor activity in fluoropyrimidine-resistant human cancer cells. TAS-102 is currently undergoing clinical trials for use in gastrointestinal cancers. In the present study, we used immunohistochemistry to investigate the expression of TK-1 and TS in various types of cancer. TK-1 and TS expression was markedly different between cancer types. High TK-1 expression was detected prominently in gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and esophageal and uterine squamous cell carcinomas. Gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and squamous cell uterine carcinomas were often accompanied by high TS expression, indicating activation of pyrimidine synthesis through both the salvage and de novo pathways. These results led us to consider that TAS-102 may also be effective for esophageal and uterine squamous cell carcinomas, as well as for gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas, even in fluoropyrimidine-resistant cases with high TS expression. In contrast, thyroid papillary carcinomas, lung adenocarcinomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, pancreatic ductal carcinomas, and renal cell carcinomas, which exhibit low TK-1 expression, may be resistant to TAS-102. In non-small cell lung cancers, high TK-1 expression was demonstrated in squamous cell carcinomas, but not in adenocarcinomas. This result suggests that TAS-102 efficacy and the pyrimidine synthetic pathway may differ depending on histological type. Our results indicate that administration of TAS-102 could be selected on the basis of the immunohistochemical evaluation of TK-1 and TS.
1975995	Esmolol reduces autonomic hypersensitivity and length of seizures induced by electroconvulsive therapy.	We evaluated the clinical effectiveness of esmolol, an ultra-short-acting beta 1-adrenergic receptor blocking drug, to control the sinus tachycardia and increase in arterial blood pressures induced by electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Each of 20 patients, ASA physical status I-III, participated in a double-blind, randomized study, involving four match-pair trials (placebo versus esmolol) during ECT. Each patient acted as his or her own control (total number of ECT procedures, 160). We administered a 4-min infusion of either placebo or esmolol at the rate of 500 micrograms.kg-1.min-1. We then induced anesthesia with methohexital and succinylcholine. After administration of electrical stimulation for ECT, the rate of infusion decreased to 300 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for three additional minutes and was then discontinued. Statistically significant reductions in mean heart rate from minute 2 until minute 15 and in maximum heart rate (the mean of each patient's maximum heart rate after seizure changed from 152 +/- 23 to 115 +/- 24 beats/min) occurred in patients given esmolol. During and immediately after infusion, arterial blood pressure also decreased. Finally, the length of seizures decreased, as manifested clinically from 48 +/- 18 to 39 +/- 14 s and on electroencephalogram from 86 +/- 41 to 67 +/- 28 s. We conclude that esmolol effectively controls the hyperdynamic response to ECT and reduces the length of seizures. The significance of the latter to the overall effectiveness of ECT is not known.
17333241	Levels of 2-thiothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (TTCA) and effect modification of polymorphisms of glutathione-related genes in vulcanization workers in the southern Sweden rubber industries.	OBJECTIVES: Workers in the rubber industry are exposed to a complex mixture of hazardous substances and have increased risk of developing several diseases. However, there is no up to date survey examining the exposure in the Swedish rubber industry. One of the toxic compounds in the industry is carbon disulfide (CS(2)), which is biotransformed to 2-thiothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (TTCA). TTCA is used as a biomarker of CS(2) exposure, but there seem to exist inter- and intraindividual variability; which could partly be due to genetic variation. The aim of the study was to determine TTCA levels and the modifying effects of glutathione-related genes in a group of Swedish rubber workers. METHODS: Urine was collected from both exposed workers and controls during the last 4 h of the work shift. The level of TTCA in urine was analyzed by liquid chromatograpy tandem mass spectrometry. Genotyping of the single nucleotide polymorphisms GCLC-129, GCLM-588, GSTA1-52, GSTP1-105 and GSTP1-114 and deletions of GSTM1 and GSTT1 were performed with real-time PCR or ordinary PCR and subsequent agarose electrophoresis. RESULTS: The highest levels of TTCA were found among workers curing with salt bath, hot air, microwaves or fluid-bed, and lower levels were found among workers curing with injection and compression molding. Furthermore, with respect to GSTM1 and GSTT1 there were statistically significant differences in TTCA-levels between genotypes among exposed workers but not among controls. The other five polymorphisms had no impact on the TTCA levels. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates relatively high levels of TTCA in urine from Swedish rubber workers. Polymorphisms in GSTM1 and GSTT1 modify the levels.
15542782	Specific inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 by PD 0332991 and associated antitumor activity in human tumor xenografts.	PD 0332991 is a highly specific inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (Cdk4) (IC50, 0.011 micromol/L) and Cdk6 (IC50, 0.016 micromol/L), having no activity against a panel of 36 additional protein kinases. It is a potent antiproliferative agent against retinoblastoma (Rb)-positive tumor cells in vitro, inducing an exclusive G1 arrest, with a concomitant reduction of phospho-Ser780/Ser795 on the Rb protein. Oral administration of PD 0332991 to mice bearing the Colo-205 human colon carcinoma produces marked tumor regression. Therapeutic doses of PD 0332991 cause elimination of phospho-Rb and the proliferative marker Ki-67 in tumor tissue and down-regulation of genes under the transcriptional control of E2F. The results indicate that inhibition of Cdk4/6 alone is sufficient to cause tumor regression and a net reduction in tumor burden in some tumors.
23604717	Inhibitory action of salicylideneamino-2-thiophenol on NF-κB signaling cascade and cyclooxygenase-2 in HNE-treated endothelial cells.	In the present study, the anti-inflammatory effect of salicylideneamino-2-thiophenol (SAL-2), a derivative of salicylate, on a potent oxidant 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE)-induced oxidative stress was investigated using rat prostate endothelial (YPEN-1) cells. We focused on anti-inflammatory activity of SAL-2 which was determined by its ability to suppress COX-2 and iNOS gene expression through suppression of NF-κB and redox regulation. We found that SAL-2 effectively inhibited HNE-induced reactive species generation, while upregulated GSH/GSSG ratio. Prostagrandin (PG) E2 production stimulated by arachidonic acid was suppressed by SAL-2. SAL-2 also downregulated COX-2 and iNOS expression induced by HNE, but salicylate did not. We found that SAL-2 inhibited HNE-mediated IKK phosphorylation, IκBα degradation and nuclear translocation of p65 which are linked to NF-κB activation. Furthermore, SAL-2 inhibited HNE-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. Collectively, SAL-2 inhibited COX-2 and iNOS gene expression through suppression of NF-κB leading to the inhibition of PGE2 synthesis. Based on these data, we propose that with its combined effect on strong anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory action, SAL-2 can be a potent anti-inflammatory agent for treatment of inflammatory-related diseases.
23416002	Amino acid derived quinazolines as Rock/PKA inhibitors.	SAR and lead optimization studies for Rock inhibitors based on amino acid-derived quinazolines are described. Studies demonstrated that these amino acid derived quinazolinones were mainly pan-Rock (I & II) inhibitors. While selectivity against other kinases could be achieved, selectivity for most of these compounds against PKA was not achieved. This is distinct from Rock inhibitors based on non-amino acid derived quinazolinones, where high selectivity against PKA could be obtained.(22) The inhibitors presented here in some cases possessed sub-nanomolar inhibition of Rock, nanomolar potency in ppMLC cell based assays, low to fair cytochrome P-450 inhibition, and good human microsomal stability.
14504136	Pharmacological profile of the 5-HT-induced inhibition of cardioaccelerator sympathetic outflow in pithed rats: correlation with 5-HT1 and putative 5-ht5A/5B receptors.	Continuous infusions of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) inhibit the tachycardiac responses to preganglionic (C7-T1) sympathetic stimulation in pithed rats pretreated with desipramine. The present study identified the pharmacological profile of this inhibitory action of 5-HT. The inhibition induced by intravenous (i.v.) continuous infusions of 5-HT (5.6 microg x kg-1x min-1) on sympathetically induced tachycardiac responses remained unaltered after i.v. treatment with saline or the antagonists GR 127935 (5-HT1B/1D), the combination of WAY 100635 (5-HT1A) plus GR 127935, ritanserin (5-HT2), tropisetron (5-HT3/4), LY215840 (5-HT7) or a cocktail of antagonists/inhibitors consisting of yohimbine (alpha2), prazosin (alpha1), ritanserin, GR 127935, WAY 100635 and indomethacin (cyclooxygenase), but was abolished by methiothepin (5-HT1/2/6/7 and recombinant 5-ht5A/5B). These drugs, used in doses high enough to block their respective receptors/mechanisms, did not modify the sympathetically induced tachycardiac responses per se. I.v. continuous infusions of the agonists 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT; 5-HT1/7 and recombinant 5-ht5A/5B), CP 93129 (r5-HT1B), sumatriptan (5-HT1B/1D), PNU-142633 (5-HT1D) and ergotamine (5-HT1B/1D and recombinant 5-ht5A/5B) mimicked the above sympatho-inhibition to 5-HT. In contrast, the agonists indorenate (5-HT1A) and LY344864 (5-ht1F) were inactive. Interestingly, 5-CT-induced cardiac sympatho-inhibition was abolished by methiothepin, the cocktail of antagonists/inhibitors, GR 127935 or the combination of SB224289 (5-HT1B) plus BRL15572 (5-HT1D), but remained unchanged when SB224289 or BRL15572 were given separately. Therefore, 5-HT-induced cardiac sympatho-inhibition, being unrelated to 5-HT2, 5-HT3, 5-HT4, 5-ht6, 5-HT7 receptors, alpha1/2-adrenoceptor or prostaglandin synthesis, seems to be primarily mediated by (i). 5-HT1 (probably 5-HT1B/1D) receptors and (ii). a novel mechanism antagonized by methiothepin that, most likely, involves putative 5-ht5A/5B receptors.
23615073	Vitamin C forestalls cigarette smoke induced NF-κB activation in alveolar epithelial cells.	Cigarette smoking causes cellular oxidative stress resulting in inflammatory diseases of lung wherein transcription factor NF-κB plays an important role. It is possible that vitamin C, an antioxidant, may prevent cigarette smoke (CS)-induced NF-κB activation that involves degradation of I-κBε and nuclear translocation of c-Rel/p50 in alveolar epithelial cells. Therefore, to examine the hypothesis, we verified the effect of vitamin C on CS-induced expression of NF-κB driven luciferase reporter and NF-κB binding at its target DNA by EMSA in alveolar epithelial A549 cells. We also examined the level of I-κBε and sub-cellular distribution of c-Rel by western blotting and immunofluorescence respectively in CSE-treated A549 cells with or without vitamin C pretreatment. We observed a significant reduction in CSE induced luciferase expression, NF-κB DNA binding, I-κBε degradation and c-Rel nuclear translocation in cells pretreated with vitamin C. To further validate the result, we examined sub-cellular distribution of c-Rel in lungs of CS-exposed guinea pigs treated or untreated with vitamin C. Result showed that vitamin C treatment resulted in markedly reduced c-Rel nuclear translocation. All these results demonstrate that vitamin C prevents CS(E)-induced NF-κB activation and thus it could be used for the prevention of CS-induced inflammatory diseases.
17179482	Effect of cromolyn on S100P interactions with RAGE and pancreatic cancer growth and invasion in mouse models.	BACKGROUND: We previously found that S100P, a member of the S100 protein family, is expressed in more than 90% of pancreatic tumors and is associated with tumor growth and invasion. In the current study, we investigated the ability of the antiallergy drug, cromolyn, to block S100P function. METHODS: Interactions between cromolyn and S100P were investigated using a drug affinity column and by examining cromolyn's effects on coimmunoprecipitation of S100P and receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE). The effects of cromolyn on cell growth, invasion, and nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB) activity of pancreatic cancer cells with (BxPC-3 and MPanc-96) and without (Panc-1) endogenous S100P were investigated by cell proliferation assay, by cell invasion assay, and by luciferase reporter gene assay, respectively. The effects of cromolyn on tumor growth in vivo were investigated in three orthotopic models (n = 20 mice per model) by administration of cromolyn (5 mg/kg body weight, daily) with and without gemcitabine (125 mg/kg body weight, biweekly), the drug currently used to treat pancreatic cancer. Tumor growth was assayed by reporter gene expression. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: S100P was retained on a cromolyn affinity column. Cromolyn blocked the coimmunoprecipitation of S100P and RAGE. In vitro, cromolyn (100 microM) inhibited S100P-stimulated Panc-1 cell proliferation (S100P, mean = 0.93 U, versus S100P + cromolyn, mean = 0.56 U, difference = 0.37 U; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.24 to 0.49 U; P = .001, n = 3), invasion (S100P, mean = 58.0%, versus S100P + cromolyn, mean = 9.4%, difference = 48.6%; 95% CI = 38.8% to 58.8%; P<.001, n = 3), and NFkappaB activity (S100P, mean = 14,460, versus S100P + cromolyn, mean = 7360 photons/s, difference = 7100 photons/s; 95% CI = 3689 to 10 510 photons/s; P = .005, n = 3). In vivo, cromolyn inhibited tumor growth in mice bearing tumor with endogenous S100P (BxPC-3: control, mean = 1.6 x 10(9) photons/s, versus cromolyn, mean = 4.4 x 10(8) photons/s, difference = 1.2 x 10(9) photons/s; 95% CI = 6.2 x 10(8) to 1.6 x 10(9) photons/s; P<.001, n = 5; MPanc-96: control, mean = 1.1 x 10(10) photons/s, versus cromolyn, mean = 4.8 x 10(9) photons/s, difference = 6.2 x 10(9) photons/s; 95% CI = 1.9 x 10(9) to 1.0 x 10(10) photons/s; P = .009, n = 5) and increased the effectiveness of gemcitabine (BxPC-3: gemcitabine, mean = 9.2 x 10(8) photons/s, versus combination, mean = 1.8 x 10(8) photons/s, difference = 7.4 x 10(8) photons/s; 95% CI = 4.5 x 10(8) to 1.0 x 10(9) photons/s; P<.001; MPanc-96: gemcitabine, mean = 4.1 x 10(9) photons/s, versus combination, mean = 2.0 x 10(9) photons/s, difference = 2.1 x 10(9) photons/s; 95% CI = 4.4 x 10(8) to 3.8 x 10(9) photons/s; P<.001). However, cromolyn had no effect on growth of tumors lacking S100P (Panc-1). CONCLUSION: Cromolyn binds S100P, prevents activation of RAGE, inhibits tumor growth, and increases the effectiveness of gemcitabine in experimental models.
23512501	NAD(P)H : Quinone Oxidoreductase 1 Inducer Activity of Some Saudi Arabian Medicinal Plants.	Medicinal plants are a rich source of biologically-active phytochemicals and have been used in traditional medicine for centuries. Specific phytochemicals and extracts of their plant sources have the ability to reduce the risk for chronic degenerative diseases by induction of enzymes involved in xenobiotic metabolism, many of which also have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory functions. One such multifunctional cytoprotective enzyme is NAD(P)H : quinone oxidoreductase. In this study, we prepared extracts of 27 Saudi Arabian medicinal plants which belong to 18 different plant families and tested their ability to induce NAD(P)H : quinone oxidoreductase in murine hepatoma cells grown in microtiter plate wells. In addition to the Brassicaceae, a known source of NAD(P)H : quinone oxidoreductase inducer activity, we found substantial inducer activity in extracts from the Apiaceae, Apocynaceae, and the Asteraceae families. Five out of a total of eight active extracts are from plants which belong to the Asteraceae family. We further show that artemisinin, an agent which is used clinically for the treatment of malaria, contributes but does not fully account for the inducer activity of the extract of Artemisia monosperma. In contrast to artemisinin, deoxyartemisinin is inactive in this assay, demonstrating the critical role of the endoperoxide moiety of artemisinin for inducer activity. Thus, the NAD(P)H : quinone oxidoreductase inducer activity of extracts of some Saudi Arabian medicinal plants indicates the presence of specific phytochemicals which have the potential to protect against chronic degenerative diseases.
17588565	Allosteric interaction of the neuromuscular blockers vecuronium and pancuronium with recombinant human muscarinic M2 receptors.	Neuromuscular blocking drugs produce muscle weakness by interaction with nicotinic-acetylcholine receptors. Cardiovascular side effects have been reported. In this study the neuromuscular blocking drug vecuronium and the controls gallamine and pancuronium slowed the rate of atropine induced [(3)H]N-methylscopolamine dissociation from Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing recombinant human muscarinic M2 receptors K(off) values min(-1); vecuronium (125 nM), atropine 0.45+/-0.07+blocker 0.04+/-0.02; gallamine (21 nM), atropine 0.42+/-0.05+blocker 0.15+/-0.04; pancuronium(21 nM), atropine 0.36+/-0.03+blocker 0.03+/-0.01). These data indicate that vecuronium, gallamine and pancuronium interact with an allosteric site on the muscarinic M2 receptor (located on the heart) and this may explain some of their cardiac side effects.
19707363	Review of the use of idursulfase in the treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis II.	Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II, Hunter syndrome) is a heterogeneous, progressive X-linked recessively inherited lysosomal storage disease that is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme iduronate-2-sulfatase, resulting in abnormal tissue accumulation of the glycosaminoglycans, dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. The disorder results from mutations in IDS, which is located at Xq28. Over 300 pathogenic mutations have been identified to date. The management of MPS II requires multidisciplinary care because of the many affected organ systems. Replacement of functional enzyme to involved tissues has been a focus of various therapies for several decades. The transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells provides enzymatic reconstitution in many target tissues, but the clinical response has been disappointing. Recently, enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant human iduronate-2-sulfatase (idursulfase, Elaprase((R)); Shire HGT Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge MA, USA), was approved by the in the US and Europe as a safe and effective treatment for individuals with MPS II. This review presents a comprehensive overview of MPS II and summarizes the recent literature on therapy for the disease.
23409714	Myeloid derived suppressor cells and their role in diseases.	Myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous population of myeloid progenitors that can play a major role in tumour development and chronic inflammation. The importance of the suppressive function ofMDSCs was first suggested by studies involving cancer patients and cancer-bearing mice. In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that MDSCs can also be involved in many other pathological conditions. MDSCs have unique ways of abrogatingan immune response in addition to those utilised by other immune-suppressive cell types, for example via the induction of arginase-1 and consequent upregulation in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Due to their heterogeneity,they further can express a variety of lineage markers, which overlap with other myeloid cell types such as Gr1,CD11b, MHCIIlo, Ly6C and Ly6G, making it difficult to identify them by surface phenotype alone. The disparity between mouse and human MDSCs further complicates the identification of these elusive cell populations. In this review, we will summarise the recent updates on the methods for eliciting and studying different MDSC subsets, including newly proposed surface phenotypes, as well as insights into how their function is being characterised in both mice and humans. In addition, exciting new discoveries suggesting their involvement across a number of different pathological settings, such as sepsis, autoimmunity and Leishmaniasis, will be discussed.
23560447	Graphene MEMS: AFM Probe Performance Improvement.	We explore the feasibility of growing a continuous layer of graphene in prepatterned substrates, like an engineered silicon wafer, and we apply this as a mold for the fabrication of AFM probes. This fabrication method proves the fabrication of SU-8 devices coated with graphene in a full-wafer parallel technology and with high yield. It also demonstrates that graphene coating enhances the functionality of SU-8 probes, turning them conductive and more resistant to wear. Furthermore, it opens new experimental possibilities such as studying graphene-graphene interaction at the nanoscale with the precision of an AFM or the exploration of properties in nonplanar graphene layers.
23265528	Structure and antioxidant activity of β-lactoglobulin-glycoconjugates obtained by high-intensity-ultrasound-induced Maillard reaction in aqueous model systems under neutral conditions.	Sonication is a new processing technology in the dairy industry. The aim of this study was to test glycation of β-lactoglobulin (BLG) in Maillard reaction (MR) induced by high-intensity ultrasound in aqueous solution under neutral conditions at 10-15 °C, which is not favourable for the MR. BLG was sonicated in the presence of glucose, galactose, lactose, fructose, ribose and arabinose. Formation of Maillard reaction products (MRPs) was monitored by mass spectrometry, spectrophotometry and fluorimetry. Ultrasound treatment resulted in formation of MRPs with all tested carbohydrates. Ribose induced the highest degree of modification resulting in 76% of BLG modified and an average of three anhydroribose units attached. Circular dichroism spectra analyses indicated only minor alterations in secondary and tertiary structures. MRP obtained by ultrasound exhibited 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity and possessed increased iron-chelating activity and reducing power. High-intensity ultrasound efficiently promotes BLG-glycoconjugates formation by MR in aqueous solutions under non-denaturing conditions.
16675639	Desvenlafaxine succinate: A new serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor.	The purpose of this study was to characterize a new chemical entity, desvenlafaxine succinate (DVS). DVS is a novel salt form of the isolated major active metabolite of venlafaxine. Competitive radioligand binding assays were performed using cells expressing either the human serotonin (5-HT) transporter (hSERT) or norepinephrine (NE) transporter (hNET) with K(i) values for DVS of 40.2 +/- 1.6 and 558.4 +/- 121.6 nM, respectively. DVS showed weak binding affinity (62% inhibition at 100 microM) at the human dopamine (DA) transporter. Inhibition of [3H]5-HT or [3H]NE uptake by DVS for the hSERT or hNET produced IC50 values of 47.3 +/- 19.4 and 531.3 +/- 113.0 nM, respectively. DVS (10 microM), examined at a large number of nontransporter targets, showed no significant activity. DVS (30 mg/kg orally) rapidly penetrated the male rat brain and hypothalamus. DVS (30 mg/kg orally) significantly increased extracellular NE levels compared with baseline in the male rat hypothalamus but had no effect on DA levels using microdialysis. To mimic chronic selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment and to block the inhibitory 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors, a 5-HT(1A) antagonist, N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-2-pyridinylcyclo hexanecarboxamide maleate salt (WAY-100635) (0.3 mg/kg s.c.), was administered with DVS (30 mg/kg orally). 5-HT increased 78% compared with baseline with no additional increase in NE or DA levels. In conclusion, DVS is a new 5-HT and NE reuptake inhibitor in vitro and in vivo that demonstrates good brain-to-plasma ratios, suggesting utility in a variety of central nervous system-related disorders.
10351938	Inhibition of cPLA2 translocation and leukotriene C4 secretion by fluticasone propionate in exogenously activated human eosinophils.	We examined the effect of the highly lipophilic corticosteroid, fluticasone propionate (FP), in causing (1) inhibition of nuclear translocation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), and (2) blockade of leukotriene C4 (LTC4) synthesis in isolated human eosinophils in vitro. Eosinophils were isolated from peripheral blood, treated with either buffer or 10(-)10 M to 10(-)6 M FP in the presence of 10 pg/ml human recombinant interleukin-5 (rhIL-5) and activated with formyl-met-leu-phe (FMLP) + cytochalasin B (CB). At 24 h, stimulated LTC4 secretion from eosinophils was unchanged; however, when corrected for cell viability, LTC4 secretion decreased from 1,429 +/- 327 pg/10(6) cells to 762 +/- 113 pg/10(6) cells for eosinophils treated for 48 h with >/= 10(-)8 M FP (p < 0.003). FMLP/CB-stimulated translocation of cPLA2 to the nuclear envelope assessed by specific immunohistochemical staining also was blocked by FP. By contrast, membrane expression of annexin-1, which was not minimal at 30 min, was substantial at 48 h for eosinophils treated with > 10(-)10 M FP, and inhibition of LTC4 synthesis was reversed by exogenous arachidonic acid (AA). We find that FP causes a decrease in stimulated eosinophil secretion of LTC4 that is regulated by phospholipase A2 (PLA2). Inhibition of LTC4 synthesis precedes the global cytotoxic effects of FP as indicated by the simultaneous upregulation of annexin-1 expression. Inhibited stimulated secretion corresponds to inhibited translocation of cPLA2 to the nuclear envelope during cellular activation.
16384941	Spectrum and frequency of mutations in IMPDH1 associated with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa and leber congenital amaurosis.	PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency and spectrum of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase type I (IMPDH1) mutations associated with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (RP), to determine whether mutations in IMPDH1 cause other forms of inherited retinal degeneration, and to analyze IMPDH1 mutations for alterations in enzyme activity and nucleic acid binding. METHODS: The coding sequence and flanking intron/exon junctions of IMPDH1 were analyzed in 203 patients with autosomal dominant RP (adRP), 55 patients with autosomal recessive RP (arRP), 7 patients with isolated RP, 17 patients with macular degeneration (MD), and 24 patients with Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). DNA samples were tested for mutations by sequencing only or by a combination of single-stranded conformational analysis and by sequencing. Production of fluorescent reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) was used to measure enzymatic activity of mutant IMPDH1 proteins. The affinity and the specificity of mutant IMPDH1 proteins for single-stranded nucleic acids were determined by filter-binding assays. RESULTS: Five different IMPDH1 variants, Thr116Met, Asp226Asn, Val268Ile, Gly324Asp, and His 372Pro, were identified in eight autosomal dominant RP families. Two additional IMPDH1 variants, Arg105Trp and Asn198Lys, were found in two patients with isolated LCA. None of the novel IMPDH1 mutants identified in this study altered the enzymatic activity of the corresponding proteins. In contrast, the affinity and/or the specificity of single-stranded nucleic acid binding were altered for each IMPDH1 mutant except the Gly324Asp variant. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in IMPDH1 account for approximately 2% of families with adRP, and de novo IMPDH1 mutations are also rare causes of isolated LCA. This analysis of the novel IMPDH1 mutants substantiates previous reports that IMPDH1 mutations do not alter enzyme activity and demonstrates that these mutants alter the recently identified single-stranded nucleic acid binding property of IMPDH. Studies are needed to further characterize the functional significance of IMPDH1 nucleic acid binding and its potential relationship to retinal degeneration.
23585555	Relationship between serum thyrotropin levels and intrarenal hemodynamic parameters in euthyroid subjects.	OBJECTIVE: Low thyroid function may be associated with a reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) calculated on the basis of creatinine metabolism. Thyroid hormone directly affects serum creatinine in muscle and low thyroid function might exert a similar direct effect in the kidney. The goal of the study was to evaluate this possibility by assessment of the inulin-based GFR and to examine the mechanism underlying the reduction of GFR. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Renal and glomerular hemodynamics were assessed by simultaneous measurements of plasma clearance of para-aminohippurate (CPAH) and inulin (Cin) in 26 patients with serum creatinine <1.00 mg/dl and without thyroid disease. All subjects were normotensive with or without antihypertensive treatment and were kept in a sodium-replete state. Renal and glomerular hemodynamics were calculated using Gomez`s formulae. RESULTS: Serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), including within the normal range (0.69-4.30 μIU/ml), was positively correlated with vascular resistance at the afferent arteriole (Ra) (r = 0.609, p = 0.0010), but not at the efferent arteriole (Re). Serum TSH was significantly and negatively correlated with renal plasma flow (RPF), renal blood flow (RBF), and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (r = -0.456, p = 0.0192; r = -0.438, p = 0.0252; r = -0.505, p = 0.0086, respectively). In multiple regression analysis, serum TSH was significantly positively associated with Ra after adjustment for age and mean blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that low thyroid function, even within the normal range, is associated with reduced RPF, RBF and GFR, which might be caused by a preferential increase of Ra.
17167165	Adenosine 5'-monophosphate kinase-activated protein kinase (PRKA) activators delay meiotic resumption in porcine oocytes.	Adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase (PRKA) is a serine/threonine kinase that functions as a metabolic switch in a number of physiological functions. The present study was undertaken to assess the role of this kinase in nuclear maturation of porcine oocytes. RT-PCR and immunoblotting revealed the expression of the PRKAA1 subunit in granulosa cells, cumulus-oocyte complexes (COC), and denuded oocytes (DO). Porcine COC and DO contained transcripts that corresponded to the expected sizes of the designed primers for PRKAB1 and PRKAG1. The PRKAA2 subunit was detected in granulosa cells and COC, whereas the PRKAG3 subunit was not detected in granulosa cells, COC or DO, whereas it was detected in the heart. The PRKAA1 protein was detected in granulosa cells, COC, DO, and zona pellucida (ZP). In the presence of the pharmacological activator of PRKA 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl 5'-monophosphate (ZMP), COC were transiently maintained in meiotic arrest in a fully reversible manner. This inhibitory effect was not observed in DO. Other known PRKA activators, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR) and metformin, also blocked meiotic resumption in COC. In contrast to mouse oocytes, in which PRKA activators reverse the inhibitory effect of PDE3 inhibitors, this combination still blocked meiotic resumption in porcine COC. These results demonstrate that the meiotic resumption of porcine COC is transiently blocked by PRKA activators in a dose-dependent manner, and that this effect is dependent on PRKA activity in cumulus cells. The present study describes a new role for PRKA in regulating meiotic resumption in COC and strongly suggests that cumulus cells play an essential role in the control of porcine oocyte maturation through the PRKA metabolic switch.
14971907	Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Inhibition of mitochondrial isozyme V with aromatic and heterocyclic sulfonamides.	The first inhibition study of the mitochondrial isozyme carbonic anhydrase (CA) V (of murine origin) with a series of aromatic and heterocyclic sulfonamides is reported. Inhibition data of the cytosolic isozymes CA I and CA II and the membrane-bound isozyme CA IV with these inhibitors are also provided for comparison. Several low nanomolar CA V inhibitors were detected (KI values in the range of 4-15 nM), most of them belonging to the acylated sulfanilamide, ureido-benzenesulfonamide, 1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide, and aminobenzolamide type of compounds. The clinically used inhibitors acetazolamide, methazolamide, ethoxzolamide, dorzolamide, brinzolamide, and topiramate on the other hand were less effective CA V inhibitors, showing inhibition constants in the range of 47-63 nM. Some of the investigated sulfonamides, such as the ureido-benzenesulfonamides and the acylated sulfanilamides showed higher affinity for CA V than for the other isozymes, CA II included, which is a remarkable result, since most compounds investigated up to now inhibited the cytosolic isozyme CA II better. These results prompt us to hypothesize that the selective inhibition of CA V, or the dual inhibition of CA II and CA V, may lead to the development of novel pharmacological applications for such sulfonamides, for example in the treatment or prevention of obesity, by inhibiting CA-mediated lipogenetic processes.
23373444	Metal-enzyme frameworks: role of metal ions in promoting enzyme self-assembly on α-zirconium(IV) phosphate nanoplates.	Previously, an ion-coupled protein binding (ICPB) model was proposed to explain the thermodynamics of protein binding to negatively charged α-Zr(IV) phosphate (α-ZrP). This model is tested here using glucose oxidase (GO) and met-hemoglobin (Hb) and several cations (Zr(IV), Cr(III), Au(III), Al(III), Ca(II), Mg(II), Zn(II), Ni(II), Na(I), and H(I)). The binding constant of GO with α-ZrP was increased ∼380-fold by the addition of either 1 mM Zr(IV) or 1 mM Ca(II), and affinities followed the trend Zr(IV) ≃ Ca(II) > Cr(III) > Mg(II) ≫ H(I) > Na(I). Binding studies could not be conducted with Au(III), Al(III), Zn(II), Cu(II), and Ni(II), as these precipitated both proteins. Zr(IV) increased Hb binding constant to α-ZrP by 43-fold, and affinity enhancements followed the trend Zr(IV) > H(I) > Mg(II) > Na(I) > Ca(II) > Cr(III). Zeta potential studies clearly showed metal ion binding to α-ZrP and affinities followed the trend, Zr(IV) ≫ Cr(III) > Zn(II) > Ni(II) > Mg(II) > Ca(II) > Au(III) > Na(I) > H(I). Electron microscopy showed highly ordered structures of protein/metal/α-ZrP intercalates on micrometer length scales, and protein intercalation was also confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction. Specific activities of GO/Zr(IV)/α-ZrP and Hb/Zr(IV)/α-ZrP ternary complexes were 2.0 × 10(-3) and 6.5 × 10(-4) M(-1) s(-1), respectively. While activities of all GO/cation/α-ZrP samples were comparable, those of Hb/cation/α-ZrP followed the trend Mg(II) > Na(I) > H(I) > Cr(III) > Ca(II) ≃ Zr(IV). Metal ions enhanced protein binding by orders of magnitude, as predicted by the ICPB model, and binding enhancements depended on charge as well as the phosphophilicity/oxophilicity of the cation.
23356880	Bioactives and nutraceutical phytochemicals naturally occurring in virgin olive oil. The case study of the Nocellara del Belice Italian olive cultivar.	This work reports on the composition and bionutritional value of organic virgin olive oil from the Nocellara del Belice variety, one cultivated in the olive areas of the Sicily region, Italy. Destoned oils obtained by processing olives with a destoning-based procedure were compared with conventional oils. This innovative technique, consisting in removing the stone from fruits prior to processing, strongly enhanced the already high-quality level of the conventional product. An in-depth analytical investigation from 2008 to 2010 showed how this innovative olive extraction process led to an excellent peculiar final product, mainly attributable to the improved biophenol and volatile composition, as well as higher concentrations of the lipophilic and vitamin antioxidants (tocopherols and tocotrienols). It had higher levels of oleocanthal (p-HPEA-EDA), a nutraceutical compound exerting actions against COX1 and COX2 (cycloxygenases). Its head-space aroma displayed new volatile phytomolecules and also had higher levels of green volatiles from the lipoxygenase (LOX)-pathway (one having as precursors the polyunsaturated fatty acids containing a cis-cis-1,4-pentadiene system). Among the other bioactives, we highlight its significant levels of trans-β-carotene and xanthophylls (lutein, violaxanthin, neoxanthin and other carotenoids). Its enhanced nutritional value was also attributable to the increased intensity of valuable tasting notes.
2907566	Relaxant and beta 2-adrenoceptor blocking activities of labetalol, dilevalol, amosulalol and KF-4317 on the rat isolated aorta.	The KCl-contracted rat aorta is relaxed by labetalol, dilevalol, amosulalol and KF-4317. These relaxations are not reversed by ICI 118,551 at 10(-6) M and, therefore, are not due to beta-adrenoceptor agonism. At 10(-7) M, labetalol, dilevalol, amosulalol and KF-4317 were beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonists as they inhibited the relaxant responses of rat aorta to procaterol.
16291771	New progestagens for contraceptive use.	The progestins have different pharmacologic properties depending upon the parent molecule, usually testosterone or progesterone (P), from which they are derived. Very small structural changes in the parent molecule may induce considerable differences in the activity of the derivative. In hormonal contraceptives, progestins represent the major agent designed for suppressing ovulation and are used in combination with estrogen (E) usually ethinyl-estradiol (EE). The development of new generations of progestins with improved selectivity profiles has been a great challenge. Steroidal and nonsteroidal progesterone receptor (PR) agonists have been synthesized as well, although the latter are still in a very early stage of development. Several new progestins, have been synthesized in the last two decades. These include dienogest (DNG), drospirenone (DRSP), Nestorone (NES), nomegestrol acetate (NOMAc) and trimegestone (TMG). These new progestins have been designed to have no androgenic or estrogenic actions and to be closer in activity to the physiological hormone P. DRSP differs from the classic progestins as it is derived from spirolactone. It is essentially an antimineralocorticoid steroid with no androgenic effect but a partial antiandrogenic effect. The antiovulatory potency of the different progestins varies. TMG and NES are the most potent progestins synthesized to date, followed by two of the older progestins, keto-desogestrel (keto-DSG) and levonorgestrel (LNG). The new molecules TMG, DRSP and DNG also have antiandrogenic activity. Striking differences exist regarding the side effects among the progestins and the combination with EE leads to other reactions related to the E itself and whether the associated progestin counterbalances, more or less, the estrogenic action. The 19-norprogesterone molecules and the new molecules DRSP and DNG are not androgenic and, therefore, have no negative effect on the lipid profile. Given their pharmacological properties, it is likely that the new progestins may have neutral effects on metabolic or vascular risks. However, this hypothesis must be confirmed in large clinical trials.
23372041	Novel locus including FGF21 is associated with dietary macronutrient intake.	Dietary intake of macronutrients (carbohydrate, protein, and fat) has been associated with risk of chronic conditions such as obesity and diabetes. Family studies have reported a moderate contribution of genetics to variation in macronutrient intake. In a genome-wide meta-analysis of a population-based discovery cohort (n = 33 533), rs838133 in FGF21 (19q13.33), rs197273 near TRAF family member-associated NF-kappa-B activator (TANK) (2p24.2), and rs10163409 in FTO (16q12.2) were among the top associations (P < 10(-5)) for percentage of total caloric intake from protein and carbohydrate. rs838133 was replicated in silico in an independent sample from the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology Consortium (CHARGE) Nutrition Working Group (n = 38 360) and attained genome-wide significance in combined analysis (Pjoint = 7.9 × 10(-9)). A cytokine involved in cellular metabolism, FGF21 is a potential susceptibility gene for obesity and type 2 diabetes. Our results highlight the potential of genetic variation for determining dietary macronutrient intake.
17498508	Biology of incretins: GLP-1 and GIP.	This review focuses on the mechanisms regulating the synthesis, secretion, biological actions, and therapeutic relevance of the incretin peptides glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). The published literature was reviewed, with emphasis on recent advances in our understanding of the biology of GIP and GLP-1. GIP and GLP-1 are both secreted within minutes of nutrient ingestion and facilitate the rapid disposal of ingested nutrients. Both peptides share common actions on islet beta-cells acting through structurally distinct yet related receptors. Incretin-receptor activation leads to glucose-dependent insulin secretion, induction of beta-cell proliferation, and enhanced resistance to apoptosis. GIP also promotes energy storage via direct actions on adipose tissue, and enhances bone formation via stimulation of osteoblast proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis. In contrast, GLP-1 exerts glucoregulatory actions via slowing of gastric emptying and glucose-dependent inhibition of glucagon secretion. GLP-1 also promotes satiety and sustained GLP-1-receptor activation is associated with weight loss in both preclinical and clinical studies. The rapid degradation of both GIP and GLP-1 by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 has led to the development of degradation-resistant GLP-1-receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. These agents decrease hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) safely without weight gain in subjects with type 2 diabetes. GLP-1 and GIP integrate nutrient-derived signals to control food intake, energy absorption, and assimilation. Recently approved therapeutic agents based on potentiation of incretin action provide new physiologically based approaches for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
10475242	Use of a PPAR gamma-specific monoclonal antibody to demonstrate thiazolidinediones induce PPAR gamma receptor expression in vitro.	Troglitazone and rosiglitazone (BRL49653), members of the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of antidiabetic drugs, are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) ligands that induce adipocyte differentiation and increase the expression of PPARgamma protein. Here, we report the characterization of a PPARgamma specific monoclonal antibody (MAb), PgammaA53.25, and its use to monitor PPARgamma expression in the noncommitted pluripotent murine mesenchymal stem cell line, C3H10T1/2, treated with TZDs. MAb PgammaA53.25 was raised against a region in the N-terminal domain of human PPARgamma shared by splice variants PPARgamma1 and PPARgamma2. It recognizes immunizing antigen in enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA), and does not cross-react with the N-terminal domains of PPARalpha or PPARdelta. In Western blotting, PgammaA53.25 reacts with the immunizing antigen as well as distinct protein bands corresponding to the molecular weight of full length PPARgamma from C3H10T1/2 cells and rat tissue lysates. In fluorescent microscopy, PgammaA53.25 immunostains nuclei of C3H10T1/2 cells treated with PPARgamma ligands. The fluorescence intensity of the treated cells is TZD dose-dependent, and correlates with lipid accumulation consistent with adipogenesis. Based on these results, we propose that MAb PgammaA53.25 will be a useful tool for elucidating the role of PPARgamma in fatty acid metabolism and adipocyte differentiation.
17624589	Glutathione S-transferase M1 and P1 polymorphisms and risk of breast cancer and fibrocystic breast conditions in Chinese women.	Enzymes encoded by the glutathione S-tranferase mu 1 (GSTM1) and pi 1 (GSTP1) genes, which are expressed in breast tissue, catalyze the detoxification of endogenous and exogenous electrophiles. Reduced enzyme activity, due to carriage of the GSTM1 deletion or the GSTP1 Ile105Val Val allele, may therefore affect susceptibility to breast cancer and related conditions. In a case-control study of Chinese women, we examined whether these polymorphisms were associated with risk of breast cancer and fibrocystic breast conditions. Women diagnosed with breast cancer (n=615) or fibrocystic breast conditions (n=467) were compared to women without clinical breast disease (n=878). We also examined whether these associations differed by menopausal status or by presence of proliferation in the extra-tumoral epithelium among women with breast cancer and in lesions among women with fibrocystic conditions. No overall association of either GST polymorphism with risk of breast cancer or fibrocystic breast conditions was observed. There was some evidence of slightly elevated cancer risk associated with carriage of the GSTM1 null genotype and at least one GSTP1 105-Val allele (OR=1.33, 95% CI, 0.99-1.80), compared to carriage of the GSTM1 non-null and GSTP1 Ile/Ile genotypes. This relationship was stronger in women who had breast cancer with extra-tumoral tissue proliferation (OR=1.77, 95% CI, 1.03-3.04). Our results suggest that GSTM1 and GSTP1 genotypes do not individually influence susceptibility to breast cancer or fibrocystic breast conditions. The observed increased risk of breast cancer associated with joint carriage of the GSTM1 null genotype and GSTP1 105-Val allele needs confirmation in other studies.
23103565	Platelet-derived growth factor triggers PKA-mediated signalling by a redox-dependent mechanism in rat renal mesangial cells.	Inflammatory glomerular kidney diseases are often accompanied with a massive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that affect the function of the glomerular filtration barrier and contribute to mesangiolysis via the induction of cell death in mesangial cells. Intriguingly, ROS also trigger fine-tuned signalling processes that affect gene expression and cell proliferation or migration. To define such redox-driven signalling devices, a proteomics approach was performed to identify the formation of protein complexes induced by ROS. To this end, protein lysates of human podocytes were treated with or without hydrogen peroxide (250 μM). Thereafter cell lysates were subjected to diagonal 2D gel electrophoresis and putative redox-affected proteins were analysed by MS/MS analysis. Among others, the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) could be identified that forms homodimers under oxidative conditions. To evaluate whether ROS dependent dimerization of PKA also occurs in a more physiological setting, rat mesangial cells were treated with platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) to induce ROS formation. This regimen resulted in a redox dependent dimerization of the R-subunits of PKA. To demonstrate whether PDGF-BB induced ROS formation affects PKA dependent pathways, the effects of PDGF-BB on phosphorylation of serine 157 of vasodilator stimulated protein (VASP) a classical target of PKA were analysed. Interestingly PDGF-BB induced VASP phosphorylation in a ROS dependent manner but independent of changes in cAMP levels. Taken together, we demonstrate a redox-mediated activation of PKA by PDGF-BB thus highlighting a physiological role of ROS as regulator of PKA activity in rat mesangial cells.
23349535	Mineralocorticoid receptor-mediated vascular insulin resistance: an early contributor to diabetes-related vascular disease?	Two-thirds of adults in the U.S. are overweight or obese, and another 26 million have type 2 diabetes (T2D). Patients with diabetes and/or the metabolic syndrome have a significantly increased risk of heart attack and stroke compared with people with normal insulin sensitivity. Decreased insulin sensitivity in cardiovascular tissues as well as in traditional targets of insulin metabolic signaling, such as skeletal muscle, is an underlying abnormality in obesity, hypertension, and T2D. In the vasculature, insulin signaling plays a critical role in normal vascular function via endothelial cell nitric oxide production and modulation of Ca(2+) handling and sensitivity in vascular smooth muscle cells. Available evidence suggests that impaired vascular insulin sensitivity may be an early, perhaps principal, defect of vascular function and contributor to the pathogenesis of vascular disease in persons with obesity, hypertension, and T2D. In the overweight and obese individual, as well as in persons with hypertension, systemic and vascular insulin resistance often occur in concert with elevations in plasma aldosterone. Indeed, basic and clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated plasma aldosterone levels predict the development of insulin resistance and that aldosterone directly interferes with insulin signaling in vascular tissues. Furthermore, elevated plasma aldosterone levels are associated with increased heart attack and stroke risk. Conversely, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonism reduces cardiovascular risk in these patient populations. Recent and accumulating evidence in this area has implicated excessive Ser phosphorylation and proteosomal degradation of the docking protein, insulin receptor substrate, and enhanced signaling through hybrid insulin/IGF-1 receptor as important mechanisms underlying aldosterone-mediated interruption of downstream vascular insulin signaling. Prevention or restoration of these changes via blockade of aldosterone action in the vascular wall with MR antagonists (i.e., spironolactone, eplerenone) may therefore account for the clinical benefit of these compounds in obese and diabetic patients with cardiovascular disease. This review will highlight recent evidence supporting the hypothesis that aldosterone and MR signaling represent an ideal candidate pathway linking early promoters of diabetes, especially overnutrition and obesity, to vascular insulin resistance, dysfunction, and disease.
15730717	[Proliferation inhibition effect of indomethacin on CML cells associated with down-regulation of phosphorylated STAT1/STAT5 and inhibition of COX-2 expression].	OBJECTIVE: To explore the mechanism of anti-proliferative effect of indomethacin (IN) on chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells. METHODS: MTT was applied to assay CML cells viability under IN intervention. STAT1, STAT5 proteins were analyzed by Western blot, the expressions of phosphorylated STAT1 or STAT5 by immunoprecipitation combined with Western blot, the cellular localization of p-STATs proteins by indirect immunofluorescence technique, and the detection of Bcl-X(L) and COX-2 protein by Western blot. RESULTS: IN could significantly inhibit the viability of CML cells. 0 approximately 400 micromol/L of IN could down-regulate the expression of p-STAT1 or p-STAT5 in a dose-response manner, p-STATs were distributed mainly in the nucleus as scattering spots. The expression of COX-2 protein could be detected in K562 cells. Both Bcl-X(L) and COX-2 proteins could be inhibited by IN in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: IN could significantly inhibit the proliferation of CML cells, the mechanism of which might be related to the suppression of STATs/Bcl-X(L) signal transduction pathway. There exists COX-2 protein expression in K562 cells, the anti-leukemia effect of IN was possibly dependent on COX-2 pathway.
16599255	Multiple enzyme inhibitions by histamine H3 receptor antagonists as potential procognitive agents.	Novel highly affine histamine H3 receptor ligands with additional inhibitory effects on the main histamine metabolizing enzyme in the brain, N-methyltransferase, chemically show structural elements of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor tacrine. H3 receptor antagonism, inhibition of metabolisation of neuronal histamine as well as inhibition of hydrolysis of acetylcholine are each one believed to improve reduced cognitive functions, which is useful for symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Some of the new compounds proved in a slightly modified colorimetric Ellmann's assay to be potent inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase and of butyrylcholinesterase which is another catalytic enzyme hydrolysing acetylcholine. Some compounds with (sub)nanomolar activities on the histamine-related targets are also active in the nanomolar concentration range on both cholinesterase targets being 5- to 40-times more potent than tacrine. Preliminary structure-activity relationships could already be drawn from the small number of compounds. The compounds acting as hybrid drugs simultaneously on four different targets to enhance cognitive functions via different pathways are promising lead structures for a new approach in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
23002036	Resistin knockout mice exhibit impaired adipocyte glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) expression.	Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) is an incretin hormone that also plays a regulatory role in fat metabolism. In 3T3-L1 cells, resistin was demonstrated to be a key mediator of GIP stimulation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity, involving activation of protein kinase B (PKB) and reduced phosphorylation of liver kinase B1 (LKB1) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). The current study was initiated to determine whether resistin has additional roles in GIP-regulated adipocyte functions. Analysis of primary adipocytes isolated from Retn(-/-), Retn(+/-), and Retn(+/+) mice found that GIP stimulated the PKB/LKB1/AMPK/LPL pathway and fatty acid uptake only in Retn(+/+) adipocytes, suggesting that GIP signaling and/or GIP responsiveness were compromised in Retn(+/-) and Retn(-/-) adipocytes. GIP receptor (GIPR) protein and mRNA were decreased in Retn(+/-) and Retn(-/-) adipocytes, but resistin treatment rescued LPL responsiveness to GIP. In addition, genes encoding tumor necrosis factor (TNF), TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2), and the signaling proteins stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK), were downregulated, and phosphorylated levels of SAPK/JNK/c-Jun were decreased in Retn(-/-) mice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were used to identify a 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-response element (TRE-III) responsible for c-Jun-mediated transcriptional activation of Gipr. Blunted GIP responsiveness in Retn(+/-) and Retn(-/-) adipocytes was therefore largely due to the greatly reduced GIPR expression associated with decreased c-Jun-mediated transcriptional activation of Gipr.
23440928	Carnosine inhibits Aβ(42) aggregation by perturbing the H-bond network in and around the central hydrophobic cluster.	Aggregation of the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) into fibrillar structures is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Thus, preventing self-assembly of the Aβ peptide is an attractive therapeutic strategy. Here, we used experimental techniques and atomistic simulations to investigate the influence of carnosine, a dipeptide naturally occurring in the brain, on Aβ aggregation. Scanning force microscopy, circular dichroism and thioflavin T fluorescence experiments showed that carnosine does not modify the conformational features of Aβ42 but nonetheless inhibits amyloid growth. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations indicated that carnosine interacts transiently with monomeric Aβ42 by salt bridges with charged side chains, and van der Waals contacts with residues in and around the central hydrophobic cluster ((17)LVFFA(21)). NMR experiments on the nonaggregative fragment Aβ12-28 did not evidence specific intermolecular interactions between the peptide and carnosine, in agreement with MD simulations. However, a close inspection of the spectra revealed that carnosine interferes with the local propensity of the peptide to form backbone hydrogen bonds close to the central hydrophobic cluster (residues E22, S26 and N27). Finally, MD simulations of aggregation-prone Aβ heptapeptide segments show that carnosine reduces the propensity to form intermolecular backbone hydrogen bonds in the region 18-24. Taken together, the experimental and simulation results (cumulative MD sampling of 0.2 ms) suggest that, despite the inability of carnosine to form stable contacts with Aβ, it might block the pathway toward toxic aggregates by perturbing the hydrogen bond network near residues with key roles in fibrillogenesis.
23395165	The Hunger Games: p53 regulates metabolism upon serine starvation.	Cancer cells reprogram their metabolism to support a high proliferative rate. A new study shows that, upon serine starvation, the tumor suppressor p53 activates p21 to shift metabolic flux from purine biosynthesis to glutathione production, which enhances cellular proliferation and viability by combating ROS (Maddocks et al., 2013).
15072849	Imiquimod, a Toll-like receptor-7 agonist, induces perforin in cytotoxic T lymphocytes in vitro.	Imiquimod (IMQ), an activator of Toll-like receptor-7 (TLR-7), induces by several routes a profound anti-viral and anti-tumor effect in vivo. Physiologically, the immune system is using perforin-containing granules of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) towards the same biological purpose. This functional synergism prompted our current experiments addressing the question whether IMQ may influence perforin-release and/or induce perforin in CTLs in vitro. In peripheral lymphocytes of healthy and diseased subjects, IMQ induced a significant increase of perforin(+) CTLs within 12h in all experiments performed. This effect was most pronounced in CTLs of patients suffering from atopic dermatitis, a model disorder for subnormal perforin expression: as compared to perforin(+) CTLs detected at time point zero (100%), up to 270% of perforin(+) CTLs were induced by 2.5 microg/ml [corrected] IMQ. Perforin release from peripheral blood CTLs after PMA/ionomycin-stimulation was not influenced significantly by IMQ. Thus, the biological activity of IMQ appears to exceed its previously known functions, inasmuch as it boosts up significantly the perforin-granule system.
23563205	Correlation between activation of PPARγ and resistin downregulation in a mouse adipocyte cell line by a series of thiazolidinediones.	The present study shows significant correlations between the EC50 for PPARγ activation in a reporter gene cell line and resistin downregulation in mouse adipocytes, and between the IC50 for resistin downregulation and the already published minimum effective dose for antihyperglycemic activity in a mouse model. These correlations indicate that PPARγ mediated downregulation of resistin might promote insulin sensitivity and that downregulation of resistin in mouse adipocytes provides an adequate and possibly more direct bioassay for screening of newly developed antihyperglycemic compounds. Because of the higher throughput of the PPARγ the resistin downregulation assays seems most suitable to be used as a second tier in a tiered screening strategy.
23475431	Characteristics and determinants of adult patients with acute poisoning attending the accident and emergency department of a teaching hospital in Qatar.	"Data about etiologic and demographic characteristics of acute poisoning in adults in Qatar are lacking. This prospective observational study was undertaken to analyze characteristics and possible determinants of acute poisoning in adults in Qatar. During 2010, 18,073 patients attended the emergency department of Hamad General Hospital, a teaching hospital in Qatar. Out of them, 599 (3.3%) patients were diagnosed as ""poisoning case"" with either chemical or pharmaceutical substances. The prevalence rate of poisoning incidence was 35.3/100,000 population. Seven patients died, corresponding with a case-fatality rate of 0.39/1000. The majority were male (65%) and the mean age was 34 years. The poisons involved were mainly chemicals (61.6%) and pharmaceuticals (38.4%). Female, mainly single, suffered more intentional poisoning compared to male. Of the patients aged 60 years and above (7.2%), the majority (95.3%) suffered unintentional poisoning with pharmaceuticals; 56% with warfarin, 12% with digoxin and 7% with insulin. Multivariate analysis shows that female gender, single status, younger than 35 years of age, being poisoned by pharmaceutical products, and the need for hospitalization are significant determinants for acute intentional poisoning after adjusting all other possible covariates. The findings of this study can be used to establish awareness and prophylactic campaigns in Qatar."
23530003	Carotid body denervation prevents the development of insulin resistance and hypertension induced by hypercaloric diets.	Increased sympathetic activity is a well-known pathophysiological mechanism in insulin resistance (IR) and hypertension (HT). The carotid bodies (CB) are peripheral chemoreceptors that classically respond to hypoxia by increasing chemosensory activity in the carotid sinus nerve (CSN), causing hyperventilation and activation of the sympathoadrenal system. Besides its role in the control of ventilation, the CB has been proposed as a glucose sensor being implicated in the control of energy homeostasis. However, to date no studies have anticipated its role in the development of IR. Herein we propose that CB overstimulation is involved in the aetiology of IR and HT, core metabolic and hemodynamic disturbances of highly prevalent diseases like the metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and obstructive sleep apnoea. We demonstrated CB activity is increased in IR animal models and that CSN resection prevents CB-overactivation and diet-induced IR and HT. Moreover we showed that insulin triggers CB, highlighting a new role for hyperinsulinemia as a stimulus for CB-overactivation. We propose that CB is implicated in the pathogenesis of metabolic and hemodynamic disturbances through sympathoadrenal overactivation and may represent a novel therapeutic target in these diseases.
14629008	Trimethoprim induces heat shock proteins and protein aggregation in E. coli cells.	Trimethoprim (TMP), an inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase, decreases the level of tetrahydrofolate supplying one-carbon units for biosynthesis of nucleotides, proteins, and panthotenate. We have demonstrated for the first time that one of the effects of the TMP action in E. coli cells is protein aggregation and induction of heat shock proteins (Hsps). TMP caused induction of DnaK, DnaJ, GroEL, ClpB, and IbpA/B Hsps. Among these Hsps, IbpA/B were most efficiently induced by TMP and coaggregated with the insoluble proteins. Upon folate stress, deletion of the delta ibpA/B operon resulted in increased protein aggregation but did not influence cell viability.
23252799	Selective separation of similarly sized proteins with tunable nanoporous block copolymer membranes.	An integral asymmetric membrane was fabricated in a fast and one-step process by combining the self-assembly of an amphiphilic block copolymer (PS-b-P4VP) with nonsolvent-induced phase separation. The structure was found to be composed of a thin layer of densely packed highly ordered cylindrical channels with uniform pore sizes perpendicular to the surface on top of a nonordered sponge-like layer. The as-assembled membrane obtained a water flux of more than 3200 L m(-2) h(-1) bar(-1), which was at least an order of magnitude higher than the water fluxes of commercially available membranes with comparable pore sizes, making this membrane particularly well suited to size-selective and charge-based separation of biomolecules. To test the performance of the membrane, we conducted diffusion experiments at the physiological pH of 7.4 using bovine serum albumin (BSA) and globulin-γ, two proteins with different diameters but too close in size (2-fold difference in molecular mass) to be efficiently separated via conventional dialysis membrane processes. The diffusion rate differed by a factor of 87, the highest value reported to date. We also analyzed charge-based diffusive transport and separation of two proteins of similar molecular weight (BSA and bovine hemoglobin (BHb)) through the membrane as a function of external pH. The membrane achieved a selectivity of about 10 at pH 4.7, the isoelectric point (pI) of BSA. We then positively charged the membrane to improve the separation selectivity. With the modified membrane BSA was completely blocked when the pH was 7.0, the pI of BHb, while BHb was completely blocked at pH 4.7. Our results demonstrate the potential of our asymmetric membrane to efficiently separate biological substances/pharmaceuticals in bioscience, biotechnology, and biomedicine applications.
12801482	Glucosamine sulfate modulates the levels of aggrecan and matrix metalloproteinase-3 synthesized by cultured human osteoarthritis articular chondrocytes.	OBJECTIVE: The functional integrity of articular cartilage is determined by a balance between chondrocyte biosynthesis of extracellular matrix and its degradation. In osteoarthritis (OA), the balance is disturbed by an increase in matrix degradative enzymes and a decrease in biosynthesis of constitutive extracellular matrix molecules, such as collagen type II and aggrecan. In this study, we examined the effects of the sulfate salt of glucosamine (GS) on the mRNA and protein levels of the proteoglycan aggrecan and on the activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 in cultured human OA articular chondrocytes. DESIGN: Freshly isolated chondrocytes were obtained from knee cartilage of patients with OA. Levels of aggrecan and MMP-3 were determined in culture media by employing Western blots after incubation with GS at concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 200 microM. Zymography (casein) was performed to confirm that effects observed at the protein level were reflected at the level of enzymatic activity. Northern hybridizations were used to examine effects of GS on levels of aggrecan and MMP-3 mRNA. Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) assays were performed on the cell layers to determine levels of cell-associated GAG component of proteoglycans. RESULTS: Treatment of OA chondrocytes with GS (1.0-150 microM) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in aggrecan core protein levels, which reached 120% at 150 microM GS. These effects appeared to be due to increased expression of the corresponding gene as indicated by an increase in aggrecan mRNA levels in response to GS. MMP-3 levels decreased (18-65%) as determined by Western blots. Reduction of MMP-3 protein was accompanied by a parallel reduction in enzymatic activity. GS caused a dose-dependent increase (25-140%) in cell-associated GAG content. Chondrocytes obtained from 40% of OA patients failed to respond to GS. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that GS can stimulate mRNA and protein levels of aggrecan core protein and, at the same time, inhibit production and enzymatic activity of matrix-degrading MMP-3 in chondrocytes from OA articular cartilage. These results provide a cogent molecular mechanism to support clinical observations suggesting that GS may have a beneficial effect in the prevention of articular cartilage loss in some patients with OA.
23590882	Interacting Glutamate Receptor-Like Proteins in Phloem Regulate Lateral Root Initiation in Arabidopsis.	Molecular, genetic, and electrophysiological evidence indicates that at least one of the plant Glu receptor-like molecules, GLR3.4, functions as an amino acid-gated Ca(2+) channel at the plasma membrane. The aspect of plant physiology, growth, or development to which GLR3.4 contributes is an open question. Protein localization studies performed here provide important information. In roots, GLR3.4 and the related GLR3.2 protein were present primarily in the phloem, especially in the vicinity of the sieve plates. GLR3.3 was expressed in most cells of the growing primary root but was not enriched in the phloem, including the sieve plate area. GLR3.2 and GLR3.4 physically interacted with each other better than with themselves as evidenced by a biophotonic assay performed in human embryonic kidney cells and Nicotiana benthamiana leaf cells. GLR3.3 interacted poorly with itself or the other two GLRs. Mutations in GLR3.2, GLR3.4, or GLR3.2 and GLR3.4 caused the same and equally severe phenotype, namely, a large overproduction and aberrant placement of lateral root primordia. Loss of GLR3.3 did not affect lateral root primordia. These results support the hypothesis that apoplastic amino acids acting through heteromeric GLR3.2/GLR3.4 channels affect lateral root development via Ca(2+) signaling in the phloem.
23200736	Tigecycline prevents LPS-induced release of pro-inflammatory and apoptotic mediators in neuronal cells.	Pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic mediators have been involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Tigecycline (Tig), a glycylcycline antibiotic and an analog of Minocycline, is shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects that are distinct from its anti-microbial activity. Its neuroprotective mechanism is unknown. In this study, we investigated the direct protective mechanisms of tigecycline against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced Rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. The results showed that tigecycline significantly attenuated the expression and the release of nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-κB), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), as well as nitric oxide (NO) levels in LPS-induced PC12 cells. In addition, tigecycline dose-dependently decreased cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activity. This later finding corroborated the results of decreased pro-apoptotic Bad, and increased anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression thus, confirming a neuroprotective effect of the drug in differentiated PC12 cells induced with LPS. The findings of our study suggest new targets for tigecycline and support the potential for tigecycline to be investigated as a therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative disorders.
23523831	Cytotoxic mechanism of Piper gaudichaudianum Kunth essential oil and its major compound nerolidol.	Piper gaudichaudianum Kunth is used in popular medicine as anti-inflamatory and against liver disorders. One of the most studied components of the plant is the essential oil for which chemical analysis revealed (E)-nerolidol as major compound. Recently, we have shown that P. gaudichaudianum essential oil possesses strong cytotoxic effects in mammalian V79 cells. The aim of this study was to analyze the cytotoxicity and mutagenicity of P. gaudichaudianum essential oil and nerolidol using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as model study. Treatment of the XV185-14c and N123 strains with essential oil and nerolidol led to cytotoxicity but did not induce mutagenicity. Our results revealed an important role of base excision repair (BER) as the ntg1, ntg2, apn1 and apn2 mutants showed pronounced sensitivity to essential oil and nerolidol. In the absence of superoxide dismutase (in sod1Δ mutant strain) sensitivity to the essential oil and nerolidol increased indicating that this oil and nerolidol are generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ROS production was confirmed by DCF-DA probing assay in Sod-deficient strains. From this, we conclude that the observed cytotoxicity to P. gaudichaudianum essential oil and nerolidol is mainly related to ROS and DNA single strand breaks generated by the presence of oxidative lesions.
23432095	Development of potent and selective indomethacin analogues for the inhibition of AKR1C3 (Type 5 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/prostaglandin F synthase) in castrate-resistant prostate cancer.	Castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a fatal, metastatic form of prostate cancer. CRPC is characterized by reactivation of the androgen axis due to changes in androgen receptor signaling and/or adaptive intratumoral androgen biosynthesis. AKR1C3 is upregulated in CRPC where it catalyzes the formation of potent androgens. This makes AKR1C3 a target for the treatment of CRPC. AKR1C3 inhibitors should not inhibit AKR1C1/AKR1C2, which inactivate 5α-dihydrotestosterone. Indomethacin, used to inhibit cyclooxygenase, also inhibits AKR1C3 and displays selectivity over AKR1C1/AKR1C2. Parallel synthetic strategies were used to generate libraries of indomethacin analogues, which exhibit reduced cyclooxygenase inhibitory activity but retain AKR1C3 inhibitory potency and selectivity. The lead compounds inhibited AKR1C3 with nanomolar potency, displayed >100-fold selectivity over AKR1C1/AKR1C2, and blocked testosterone formation in LNCaP-AKR1C3 cells. The AKR1C3·NADP(+)·2'-des-methyl-indomethacin crystal structure was determined, and it revealed a unique inhibitor binding mode. The compounds reported are promising agents for the development of therapeutics for CRPC.
22718275	Lipid biomarkers of oxidative stress in a genetic mouse model of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome.	7-Dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) accumulates in tissues and fluids of patients with Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS), which is caused by mutations in the gene encoding 3β-hydroxysterol-Δ(7)-reductase (DHCR7). We recently reported that 7-DHC is the most reactive lipid molecule toward free radical oxidation (lipid peroxidation) and 14 oxysterols have been identified as products of oxidation of 7-DHC in solution. As the high oxidizability of 7-DHC may lead to systemic oxidative stress in SLOS patients, we report here lipid biomarkers of oxidative stress in a Dhcr7-KO mouse model of SLOS, including oxysterols, isoprostanes (IsoPs), and neuroprostanes (NeuroPs) that are formed from the oxidation of 7-DHC, arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, respectively. In addition to a previously described oxysterol, 3β,5α-dihydroxycholest-7-en-6-one (DHCEO), we provide evidence for the chemical structures of three new oxysterols in the brain and/or liver tissue of Dhcr7-KO mice, two of which were quantified. We find that levels of IsoPs and NeuroPs are also elevated in brain and/or liver tissues of Dhcr7-KO mice relative to matching WT mice. While IsoPs and NeuroPs have been established as a reliable measurement of lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress in vivo, we show that in this genetic SLOS mouse model, 7-DHC-derived oxysterols are present at much higher levels than IsoPs and NeuroPs and thus are better markers of lipid oxidation and related oxidative stress.
23376140	Hepatocytes display a compensatory survival response against cadmium toxicity by a mechanism mediated by EGFR and Src.	Although the liver is a cadmium-target organ, hepatocyte response involved in its toxicity is not yet elucidated. A link between this heavy metal treatment and Stat3 signaling pathways was examined in primary mouse hepatocytes. We provided evidence of a novel link among NADPH oxidase and Stat3 signaling, mediated by Src, EGFR, and Erk1/2. Cadmium activates NADPH oxidase. ROS produced by this oxidase activates Src, enable that in turn, transactivates EGFR that activates Stat3 in tyrosine, allowing its dimerization. Also, ROS from NADPH oxidase favors ERK1/2 activation that phosphorylates Stat3 in serine, resulting in a compensatory or adaptive survival response such as production of metallothionein-II in short Cd exposure times. However, after 12h CdCl2 treatment, cell viability diminished in 50%, accompanied by a drastic decrease of metallothionein-II production, and an increase in p53 activation and the pro-apoptotic protein Bax.
7906055	Agmatine: an endogenous clonidine-displacing substance in the brain.	Clonidine, an antihypertensive drug, binds to alpha 2-adrenergic and imidazoline receptors. The endogenous ligand for imidazoline receptors may be a clonidine-displacing substance, a small molecule isolated from bovine brain. This clonidine-displacing substance was purified and determined by mass spectroscopy to be agmatine (decarboxylated arginine), heretofore not detected in brain. Agmatine binds to alpha 2-adrenergic and imidazoline receptors and stimulates release of catecholamines from adrenal chromaffin cells. Its biosynthetic enzyme, arginine decarboxylase, is present in brain. Agmatine, locally synthesized, is an endogenous agonist at imidazoline receptors, a noncatecholamine ligand at alpha 2-adrenergic receptors and may act as a neurotransmitter.
16719540	How may anticancer chemotherapy with fluorouracil be individualised?	Fluorouracil is used clinically against various solid tumours. Both fluorouracil toxicity and pharmacokinetics vary highly within and between individuals. The reasons why doses are not individualised routinely are difficulties in defining, predicting and achieving an optimal fluorouracil exposure or dose because of a narrow therapeutic index, nonlinear pharmacokinetics, variabilities in administration rates and metabolism, and in targets like thymidylate synthase. To individualise fluorouracil administration before the first dose, assessment of the individual dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) activity may be useful, because this genetically highly polymorphic enzyme controls approximately 80% of fluorouracil elimination. A complete or partial loss of DPD activity in 0.1 and 3-5% of Caucasians, respectively, leads to increased fluorouracil exposure and toxicity. Several methods to assess DPD activity in patients have been proposed (genotyping, various phenotyping methods), but each of them has limitations, as has the fluorouracil test dose approach. To adapt exposure towards fluorouracil a priori, a combination of genotyping and phenotyping may yield better prediction of toxicity than one method alone. A prerequisite for dose adaptation is the definition of fluorouracil exposure ranges with sufficient therapeutic activity, but without serious toxicity. While an increased risk of leukopenia, diarrhoea, stomatitis, and hand-foot syndrome during continuous 5-day infusions was related to fluorouracil exposures above an area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) threshold of 25-30 mg.h/L, tumour response was higher when an AUC of approximately 30 mg.h/L was achieved, illustrating the extremely narrow therapeutic window of fluorouracil. Pharmacokinetic target values are less clear for other regimens, including chronomodulated regimens, which yielded a superior clinically efficacy and tolerability in several trials. However, the monitoring of fluorouracil plasma concentrations seems principally useful for individual a posteriori dose adjustment. Whether an adaptation of the fluorouracil starting dose to the results of two DPD activity tests before fluorouracil administration a priori, and the adaptation of doses to fluorouracil exposure a posteriori is a reasonable approach to better prevent toxicity and increase efficacy, remains to be evaluated in randomised clinical studies comparing these strategies to routine clinical safety monitoring.
10229494	Influence of halothane on phospholipase A2 and enzymatic methylations in the rat retinal membranes.	Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and phospholipid methylases (PLM) play significant roles in transmitter release and membrane signal transduction, respectively. Previous studies have indicated that PLMs occur in the rat brain synaptosomal and retinal membranes, and they are activated under halothane anesthesia. The influence of halothane on PLA2 is not known. Therefore, we have investigated the effect of halothane on retinal PLA2 activity. Rat retinal sonicates were assayed for PLA2 activity using 1-palmitoyl-2[1-14C]arachidonyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE, 2.2 nmol) in Tris buffer (10 mM, pH 7.4) at 37 degrees C with and without halothane (0.25-2.0 mM) in the assay medium. These studies gave the following results: (1) Rat retinal sonicates contained PLA2 activity of 4.2+/-0.8 pmol PE hydrolyzed/100 ng protein/hr; (2) Halothane (0.25-2.0 mM) increased PLA2 activity by 20 to 150% depending upon concentration; (3) The lower concentration of halothane (0.25 mM) exhibited high activation of PLA2 (150%); (4) High concentrations of halothane (1.0-2.0 mM) caused a low degree of activation of PLA2 (20%); and (5) During phospholipid methylation of retinal membranes with S-adenosyl-L-methionine in the presence of halothane, increased amounts of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were formed. This increase in FAME (45%) was possibly due to the hydrolysis of phospholipids by activated PLA2, liberating fatty acids which were methylated. This increase in FAME (45%) was inhibited by mepacrine (quinacrine) (10 microM), an inhibitor of PLA2. These observations suggest that the release of retinal transmitters (dopamine, acetylcholine and others) is affected during halothane anesthesia, due to activation of PLA2 and enhanced fusogenic activity of vesicular membranes with plasma membrane and depletion of vesicles.
23426609	Prescription of antiepileptics and the risk of road traffic crash.	Studies assessing the impact of epilepsy and its medication on the risk of road traffic crashes have shown inconsistent results. The aim in this study was to assess this risk using French databases. Data from three French national databases were extracted and matched: the national health care insurance database, police reports, and the national police database of injurious crashes. Only antiepileptics prescribed predominantly in epilepsy were studied (phenobarbital, phenytoin, ethosuximide, valproic acid, vigabatrin, tiagabin, levitiracetam, zonisamide, and lacosamide). A case-control analysis comparing responsible and non-responsible drivers and a case-crossover analysis were performed. Drivers (72 685) involved in an injurious crash in France between July 2005 and May 2008, were included. Drivers exposed to prescribed antiepileptic medicines (n = 251) had an increased risk of being responsible for a crash (OR 1.74 [1.29-2.34]). The association was also significant for the most severe epileptic patients (n = 99; OR = 2.20 [1.31-3.69]). Case-crossover analysis found no association between crash risk and treatment prescription. Patients with prescription of antiepileptic drugs should be cautioned about their potential risk of road traffic crash. This risk is however more likely to be related to seizures than to the effect of antiepileptic medicines.
23416946	Transcription forms and remodels supercoiling domains unfolding large-scale chromatin structures.	DNA supercoiling is an inherent consequence of twisting DNA and is critical for regulating gene expression and DNA replication. However, DNA supercoiling at a genomic scale in human cells is uncharacterized. To map supercoiling, we used biotinylated trimethylpsoralen as a DNA structure probe to show that the human genome is organized into supercoiling domains. Domains are formed and remodeled by RNA polymerase and topoisomerase activities and are flanked by GC-AT boundaries and CTCF insulator protein-binding sites. Underwound domains are transcriptionally active and enriched in topoisomerase I, 'open' chromatin fibers and DNase I sites, but they are depleted of topoisomerase II. Furthermore, DNA supercoiling affects additional levels of chromatin compaction as underwound domains are cytologically decondensed, topologically constrained and decompacted by transcription of short RNAs. We suggest that supercoiling domains create a topological environment that facilitates gene activation, providing an evolutionary purpose for clustering genes along chromosomes.
23201441	Effect of body-weight loading onto the articular cartilage on the occurrence of quinolone-induced chondrotoxicity in juvenile rats.	The effect of body-weight loading onto the articular cartilage on the occurrence of chondrotoxicity was investigated in male juvenile Sprague-Dawley rats given ofloxacin (OFLX) orally once at 900 mg/kg. Just after dosing of OFLX, hindlimb unloading was performed for 0, 2, 4, or 8 h by a tail-suspension method. Animals were sacrificed at 8h post-dose, and then the distal femoral articular cartilage was subjected to a histological examination and an investigation for gene expression of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 12a (Tnfrsf12a); prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (Ptgs2); plasminogen activator, urokinase receptor (Plaur); and matrix metalloproteinase 3 (Mmp3) by qRT-PCR analysis. As a result, cartilage lesions and up-regulations of these 4 genes that were seen in rats without the tail suspension were not observed in rats with the 8-h tail suspension, and a tendency to decrease in the incidence of the cartilage lesions and the gene expression was noted in a tail-suspension time dependent manner. Our results clearly indicate that body-weight loading onto the cartilage is necessary to induce cartilage lesions and gene expression of Tnfrsf12a, Ptgs2, Plaur, and Mmp3 in juvenile rats treated with OFLX.
20980153	Synthesis and structure-activity studies of benzyl ester meperidine and normeperidine derivatives as selective serotonin transporter ligands.	A series of benzyl esters of meperidine and normeperidine were synthesized and evaluated for binding affinity at serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine transporters. The 4-methoxybenzyl ester 8b and 4-nitrobenzyl ester 8c in the meperidine series and 4-methoxybenzyl ester 14a in the normeperidine series exhibited low nanomolar binding affinities at the SERT (K(i) values <2nM) and high SERT selectivity (DAT/SERT >1500 and NET/SERT >1500).
23383423	International Union of Pharmacology. LXXXVII. Complement peptide C5a, C4a, and C3a receptors.	The activation of the complement cascade, a cornerstone of the innate immune response, produces a number of small (74-77 amino acid) fragments, originally termed anaphylatoxins, that are potent chemoattractants and secretagogues that act on a wide variety of cell types. These fragments, C5a, C4a, and C3a, participate at all levels of the immune response and are also involved in other processes such as neural development and organ regeneration. Their primary function, however, is in inflammation, so they are important targets for the development of antiinflammatory therapies. Only three receptors for complement peptides have been found, but there are no satisfactory antagonists as yet, despite intensive investigation. In humans, there is a single receptor for C3a (C3a receptor), no known receptor for C4a, and two receptors for C5a (C5a₁ receptor and C5a₂ receptor). The most recently characterized receptor, the C5a₂ receptor (previously known as C5L2 or GPR77), has been regarded as a passive binding protein, but signaling activities are now ascribed to it, so we propose that it be formally identified as a receptor and be given a name to reflect this. Here, we describe the complex biology of the complement peptides, introduce a new suggested nomenclature, and review our current knowledge of receptor pharmacology.
17827008	From ATP to AZD6140: the discovery of an orally active reversible P2Y12 receptor antagonist for the prevention of thrombosis.	Starting from adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the identification of a novel series of P2Y(12) receptor antagonists and exploitation of their SAR is described. Modifications of the acidic side chain and the purine core and investigation of hydrophobic substituents led to a series of neutral molecules. The leading compound, 17 (AZD6140), is currently in a large phase III clinical trial for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes and prevention of thromboembolic clinical sequelae.
15240345	Glycolate and glyoxylate metabolism in HepG2 cells.	Oxalate synthesis in human hepatocytes is not well defined despite the clinical significance of its overproduction in diseases such as the primary hyperoxalurias. To further define these steps, the metabolism to oxalate of the oxalate precursors glycolate and glyoxylate and the possible pathways involved were examined in HepG2 cells. These cells were found to contain oxalate, glyoxylate, and glycolate as intracellular metabolites and to excrete oxalate and glycolate into the medium. Glycolate was taken up more effectively by cells than glyoxylate, but glyoxylate was more efficiently converted to oxalate. Oxalate was formed from exogenous glycolate only when cells were exposed to high concentrations. Peroxisomes in HepG2 cells, in contrast to those in human hepatocytes, were not involved in glycolate metabolism. Incubations with purified lactate dehydrogenase suggested that this enzyme was responsible for the metabolism of glycolate to oxalate in HepG2 cells. The formation of 14C-labeled glycine from 14C-labeled glycolate was observed only when cell membranes were permeabilized with Triton X-100. These results imply that peroxisome permeability to glycolate is restricted in these cells. Mitochondria, which produce glyoxylate from hydroxyproline metabolism, contained both alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT)2 and glyoxylate reductase activities, which can convert glyoxylate to glycine and glycolate, respectively. Expression of AGT2 mRNA in HepG2 cells was confirmed by RT-PCR. These results indicate that HepG2 cells will be useful in clarifying the nonperoxisomal metabolism associated with oxalate synthesis in human hepatocytes.
9117115	The effects of tamsulosin, a high affinity antagonist at functional alpha 1A- and alpha 1D-adrenoceptor subtypes.	1. The actions of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist tamsulosin have been examined at functional alpha 1-adrenoceptor subtypes and compared with those at the human prostate receptor. 2. At the alpha 1D-adrenoceptors of the rat aorta, tamsulosin acted as a competitive antagonist with a high affinity (pKB = 10.1). 3. At the alpha 1B-adrenoceptor of the rat spleen and rabbit corpus cavernosum penis, tamsulosin again acted as a competitive antagonist but with a significantly lower affinity (pKB = 8.9-9.2). 4. Tamsulosin acted as an unsurmountable antagonist of the alpha 1A-adrenoceptor-mediated responses of the rat and human vas deferens, reducing maximal responses to phenylephrine by 20% and 50%, respectively, at an antagonist concentration of 1 nM. Responses of depolarized (100 mM KCl) rat vas deferens preparations were unaffected by 10 nM tamsulosin but this concentration reduced maximal responses to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in this tissue. 5. When longer antagonist incubation periods (> or = 60 min) were used, tamsulosin behaved as a competitive antagonist on the human prostate with a significantly higher affinity (pKB = 10.0) than obtained at the alpha 1B-adrenoceptor. 6. The data demonstrate that tamsulosin is a high affinity antagonist at functional alpha 1-adrenoceptors with a selectivity alpha 1D > or = alpha 1A > alpha 1B. In some tissues the compound exhibits an additional unsurmountable antagonist action, the clinical significance of which is unknown.
16866189	Anti-clastogenic effect of beta-glucan extracted from barley towards chemically induced DNA damage in rodent cells.	beta-Glucan (BG) was tested in vitro to determine its potential clastogenic and/or anti-clastogenic activity, and attempts were made to elucidate its possible mechanism of action by using combinations with an inhibitor of DNA polymerase. The study was carried out on cells deficient (CHO-k1) and cells proficient (HTC) in phases I and II enzymes, and the DNA damage was assessed by the chromosomal aberration assay. BG did not show a clastogenic effect, but was anti-clastogenic in both cell lines used, and at all concentrations tested (2.5, 5 and 10 microg/mL) in combination with damage inducing agents (methylmethane sulfonate in cell line CHO-k1, and methylmethane sulfonate or 2-aminoanthracene in cell line HTC). BG also showed a protective effect in the presence of a DNA polymerase beta inhibitor (cytosine arabinoside-3-phosphate, Ara-C), demonstrating that BG does not act through an anti-mutagenic mechanism of action involving DNA polymerase beta.
12513997	L-proline accumulation and freeze tolerance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are caused by a mutation in the PRO1 gene encoding gamma-glutamyl kinase.	We previously isolated a mutant which showed a high tolerance to freezing that correlated with higher levels of intracellular L-proline derived from L-proline analogue-resistant mutants. The mutation responsible for the analogue resistance and L-proline accumulation was a single nuclear dominant mutation. By introducing the mutant-derived genomic library into a non-L-proline-utilizing strain, the mutant was found to carry an allele of the wild-type PRO1 gene encoding gamma-glutamyl kinase, which resulted in a single amino acid replacement; Asp (GAC) at position 154 was replaced by Asn (AAC). Interestingly, the allele of PRO1 was shown to enhance the activities of gamma-glutamyl kinase and gamma-glutamyl phosphate reductase, both of which catalyze the first two steps of L-proline synthesis from L-glutamate and which together may form a complex in vivo. When cultured in liquid minimal medium, yeast cells expressing the mutated gamma-glutamyl kinase were found to accumulate intracellular L-proline and showed a prominent increase in cell viability after freezing at -20 degrees C compared to the viability of cells harboring the wild-type PRO1 gene. These results suggest that the altered gamma-glutamyl kinase results in stabilization of the complex or has an indirect effect on gamma-glutamyl phosphate reductase activity, which leads to an increase in L-proline production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The approach described in this paper could be a practical method for breeding novel freeze-tolerant yeast strains.
23466444	Pro-inflammatory properties and neutrophil activation by Helicobacter pylori urease.	The gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori produces large amounts of urease, whose enzyme activity enables the bacterium to survive in the stomach. We have previously shown that ureases display enzyme-independent effects in mammalian models, most through lipoxygenases-mediated pathways. Here, we evaluated potential pro-inflammatory properties of H. pylori urease (HPU). Mouse paw edema and activation of human neutrophils were tested using a purified, cell-free, recombinant HPU. rHPU induced paw edema with intense neutrophil infiltration. In vitro 100 nM rHPU was chemotactic to human neutrophils, inducing production of reactive oxygen species. rHPU-activated neutrophils showed increased lifespan, with inhibition of apoptosis accompanied by alterations of Bcl-XL and Bad contents. These effects of rHPU persisted in the absence of enzyme activity. rHPU-induced paw edema, neutrophil chemotaxis and apoptosis inhibition reverted in the presence of the lipoxygenase inhibitors esculetin or AA861. Neutrophils exposed to rHPU showed increased content of lipoxygenase(s) and no alteration of cyclooxygenase(s). Altogether, our data indicate that HPU, besides allowing the bacterial survival in the stomach, could play an important role in the pathogenesis of the gastrointestinal inflammatory disease caused by H. pylori.
23253441	The discovery of fused oxadiazepines as gamma secretase modulators for treatment of Alzheimer's disease.	In an attempt to further improve overall profiles of the oxadiazine series of GSMs, in particular the hERG activity, conformational modifications of the core structure resulted in the identification of fused oxadiazepines such as 7i which had an improved hERG inhibition profile and was a highly efficacious GSM in vitro and in vivo in rats. These SAR explorations offer opportunities to identify potential drugs to treat Alzheimer's disease.
21838705	The mechanisms responsible for garlic - drug interactions and their in vivo relevance.	Garlic phytochemicals and garlic supplements influence the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic behavior of concomitantly ingested drugs. In this paper we have summarized the mechanisms responsible for first-pass intestinal pharmacokinetic interactions by investigating the intestinal permeability of some cardiovascular, antiviral drugs, their transport with hepatic transporters and CYP3A4 metabolism. Transporter-enzyme interplay was studied with several in vitro models of varying complexity: rat small intestine and Caco-2 cell monolayers were used in studies of intestinal processes, and hepatic pharmacokinetics was monitored in HepG2 cells, isolated rat hepatocytes and rat liver slices. Garlic phytochemicals from aged garlic extract modified the activities of secretory and absorptive transporters in both intestine and liver and competitively inhibited CYP3A4 enzyme. The increased activities of the most important intestinal efflux (P-glycoprotein - Pgp, Multidrug Resistance Associated Protein 2 - MRP-2, Breast Cancer Resistance Protein - BCRP) and uptake (MonoCarboxylate Transporter 1 - MCT1, Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide - OATP, Peptide transporter 1 - PepT1) transporters were caused by changes in electrophysiological membrane properties and by allosteric modifications. Because clinical studies investigating interactions between garlic and human immunodeficiency virus protease inhibitors saquinavir and ritonavir have already been performed, we used these in vivo data to evaluate the in vitro results and the reliability of the models employed as screening tools for forecasting the potential of first-pass intestinal metabolism changes. We also assessed the probability of pharmacokinetic interactions with garlic of the novel drug darunavir and other cardiovascular drugs. Finally, selected garlic phytochemicals were tested for their ability to influence P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4 activities.
23254198	Inhibitory effects of a bazedoxifene/conjugated equine estrogen combination on human breast cancer cells in vitro.	Breast cancer incidence is increased in women receiving menopausal hormone therapy with estrogen plus progestin but not with estrogen alone. The use of a tissue-selective estrogen complex (TSEC) has been proposed as a novel menopausal hormone therapy strategy to eliminate the requirement for a progestogen. Combination of bazedoxifene (BZA) with conjugated estrogens (CEs), the first TSEC, has shown beneficial effects. Whether it would exert antiestrogenic effects on breast cancer is not clear. To address this issue, we compared estradiol (E(2)) and CE alone on proliferation and apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. CE stimulated growth of MCF-7 cells at a peak concentration 10-fold higher than required for E(2). Both CE and E(2) alone increased DNA synthesis and reduced apoptosis with activation of MAPK, Akt, and p70S6K and up-regulation of antiapoptotic factors survivin, Bcl-2, and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, These effects could be completely blocked by BZA. Gene expression studies demonstrated that CE and E(2) were equally potent on expression of cMyc, pS2, and WNT1 inducible signaling pathway protein 2, whereas the stimulatory effects of CE on progesterone receptor and amphiregulin expression were weaker than E(2). BZA effectively blocked each of these effects and showed no estrogen agonistic effects when used alone. Our results indicate that the stimulatory effects of E(2) or CE on breast cancer cells could be completely abrogated by BZA. These studies imply that the CE/BZA, TSEC, exerts antiestrogenic effects on breast cancer cells and might block the growth of occult breast neoplasms in postmenopausal women, resulting in an overall reduction in tumor incidence.
23305993	Chemical synthesis, docking studies and biological effects of a pan peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonist and cyclooxygenase inhibitor.	The compound (5Z)-5-[(5-bromo-1H-indol-3-yl)methylene]-3-(4-chlorobenzyl)-thiazolidine-2,4-dione (LYSO-7) was synthesised in order to obtain a new type of anti-inflammatory drug, designed with hybrid features to inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) and also to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR). Results obtained from docking (in silico) studies corroborated with experimental data, showing the potential affinity between the studied ligand and targets. The specificity of LYSO-7 for COX-enzymes was detected by the inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 activities by 30% and 20%, respectively. In transactivation reporter gene assays LYSO-07 showed a pan partial agonist effect on the three PPAR subtypes (PPARγ, PPARα and PPARβ/δ). The agonist action on PPARγ was also observed by a pharmacological approach, as the reduction in the Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) secretion and nitric oxide (NO) production by mouse neutrophils was blocked by GW9962, a specific PPARγ antagonist. Additionally, the in vivo effect was measured by reduced carrageenan-induced neutrophil influx into the subcutaneous tissue of mice. Taken together, these data show that LYSO-7 displays a potent in vivo anti-inflammatory effect during the innate acute response, which is dependent on its associated COX inhibitory activities and PPAR activation.
15023454	Targeted prevention of renal accumulation and toxicity of gentamicin by aminoglycoside binding receptor antagonists.	Receptor-mediated endocytosis plays an important role in accumulation of aminoglycosides in renal proximal tubule. To prevent aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity following concentrated accumulation of gentamicin in the kidney, effect of cationic proteins and their peptide fragments, which could inhibit gentamicin binding to its binding receptor(s), was investigated. Among several substrates for megalin, an endocytic receptor responsible for renal accumulation of aminoglycosides, cytochrome c potently inhibited gentamicin accumulation in renal cortex. Concentration-dependent inhibition by cytochrome c on gentamicin uptake was also observed in OK kidney epithelial cells expressing megalin. In addition, gentamicin-induced increase in urinary excretion of N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (NAG), a marker of renal tubular damage, was significantly reduced by cytochrome c. We next attempted to find a peptide fragment with lower molecular size showing inhibitory effect on gentamicin uptake. Cyto79-88 inhibited gentamicin uptake in OK cells, but had little effect on renal accumulation of gentamicin in mice in vivo. On one hand, a peptide fragment of neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP), which interacts with acidic phospholipids like aminoglycosides, inhibited gentamicin accumulation not only in OK cells but also in mouse kidney. These results show that substrates and/or their peptide fragments for aminoglycoside binding receptor such as megalin might be useful for preventing aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity.
17289088	Roles played by lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 in the regulation of lymphocytic cholinergic activity.	Lymphocytes possess the essential components of a cholinergic system, including acetylcholine (ACh); choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), its synthesizing enzyme; and both muscarinic and nicotinic ACh receptors (mAChRs and nAChRs, respectively). Stimulation of lymphocytes with phytohemagglutinin, which activates T cells via the T cell receptor/CD3 complex, enhances the synthesis and release of ACh and up-regulates expression of ChAT and M(5) mAChR mRNAs. In addition, activation of protein kinase C and increases in intracellular cAMP also enhance cholinergic activity in T cells, and lymphocyte function associated antigen-1 (LFA-1; CD11a/CD18) is an important mediator of leukocyte migration and T cell activation. Anti-CD11a monoclonal antibody (mAb) as well as antithymocyte globulin containing antibodies against CD2, CD7 and CD11a all increase ChAT activity, ACh synthesis and release, and expression of ChAT and M(5) mAChR mRNAs in T cells. The cholesterol-lowering drug simvastatin inhibits LFA-1 signaling by binding to an allosteric site on CD11a (LFA-1 alpha chain), which leads to immunomodulation. We found that simvastatin abolishes anti-CD11a mAb-induced increases in lymphocytic cholinergic activity in a manner independent of its cholesterol-lowering activity. Collectively then, these results indicate that LFA-1 contributes to the regulation of lymphocytic cholinergic activity via CD11a-mediated pathways and suggest that simvastatin exerts its immunosuppressive effects in part via modification of lymphocytic cholinergic activity.
23229511	Aryl hydrocarbon receptor is a target of 17-Allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin and enhances its anticancer activity in lung adenocarcinoma cells.	We have demonstrated that aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma (AD). AhR is usually associated with heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) in the cytoplasm. 17-Allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), an Hsp90 inhibitor, is currently under evaluation for its anticancer activity in clinical trials. Here we investigated whether AhR plays a role in 17-AAG-mediated anticancer activity by functioning as a downstream target or by modulating its anticancer efficacy. AhR expression in lung AD cells was modulated by siRNA interference or overexpression. Tumor growth was determined with colony formation in vitro or in vivo. Anticancer activity of 17-AAG was determined by measuring cell viability, cell cycle distribution, and expression of cell cycle regulators. Proteins and mRNA levels were examined by immunoblotting and the real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, respectively. In this study, AhR overexpression positively modulated growth of lung AD cells, at least partially, via RelA-dependent mechanisms. Although treatment with 17-AAG reduced AhR levels and AhR-regulated gene expression in lung AD cells, AhR expression increased anticancer activity of 17-AAG. In addition, 17-AAG treatment reduced cell viability, CDK2, CDK4, cyclin E, cyclin D1, and phosphorylated Rb levels in AhR-expressing lung AD cells. NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1), which is regulated by AhR, was shown to increase anticancer activity of 17-AAG in cells. Knockdown of NQO1 expression attenuated the reduction of cell cycle regulators by 17-AAG treatment in AhR overexpressed cells. We demonstrated that AhR protein not only functions as a downstream target of 17-AAG, but also enhances anticancer activity of 17-AAG in lung AD cells.
16790533	A potential role for cyclized quinones derived from dopamine, DOPA, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in proteasomal inhibition.	We examined the ability of oxidation products of dopamine, DOPA, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) to inhibit proteasomal activity. Dopamine, DOPA, and DOPAC underwent tyrosinase-catalyzed oxidation to generate aminochrome, dopachrome, and furanoquinone, respectively. In these studies, the oxidation of dopamine by tyrosinase generated product(s) that inhibited the proteasome, and proteasomal inhibition correlated with the presence of the UV-visible spectrum of aminochrome. The addition of superoxide dismutase and catalase did not prevent proteasomal inhibition. The addition of NADH and the quinone reductase NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) protected against aminochrome-induced proteasome inhibition. Although NQO1 protected against dopamine-induced proteasomal inhibition, the metabolism of aminochrome by NQO1 led to oxygen uptake because of the generation of a redox-labile cyclized hydroquinone, further demonstrating the lack of involvement of oxygen radicals in proteasomal inhibition. DOPA underwent tyrosinase-catalyzed oxidation to form dopachrome, and similar to aminochrome, proteasomal inhibition correlated with the presence of a dopachrome UV-visible spectrum. The inclusion of NQO1 did not protect against proteasomal inhibition induced by dopachrome. Oxidation of DOPAC by tyrosinase generated furanoquinone, which was a poor proteasome inhibitor. These studies demonstrate that oxidation products, including cyclized quinones derived from dopamine and related compounds, rather than oxygen radicals have the ability to inhibit the proteasome. They also suggest an important protective role for NQO1 in protecting against dopamine-induced proteasomal inhibition. The ability of endogenous intermediates formed during dopaminergic metabolism to cause proteasomal inhibition provides a potential basis for the selectivity of dopaminergic neuron damage in Parkinson's disease.
17369902	Peroxide-eliminating oxidoreductases as biosensors of antioxidant components of medicinal plants.	A simple in vitro test system based on the use of peroxide-eliminating oxidoreductases (glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase) is described. The system allows detection of antioxidant properties of aqueous extracts from raw medicinal plants. The system was used for testing water extract of Baikalskii-6 tea. Antioxidant and, presumably, adaptogenic activity of this tea was detected. In addition to activation of glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase, the preparation inhibits erythrocyte catalase and therefore should not be used for detection of antioxidant activity in in vitro screening tests.
23223023	Increase of palmitic acid concentration impairs endothelial progenitor cell and bone marrow-derived progenitor cell bioavailability: role of the STAT5/PPARγ transcriptional complex.	Metabolic profiling of plasma nonesterified fatty acids discovered that palmitic acid (PA), a natural peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) ligand, is a reliable type 2 diabetes biomarker. We investigated whether and how PA diabetic (d-PA) concentrations affected endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) and bone marrow-derived hematopoietic cell (BM-HC) biology. PA physiologic (n-PA) and d-PA concentrations were used. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen content and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5), PPARγ, cyclin D1, and p21(Waf) expression were evaluated. Small interfering RNA technology, gene reporter luciferase assay, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, and coimmunoprecipitation were exploited. In vivo studies and migration assays were also performed. d-PA, unlike n-PA or physiological and diabetic oleic and stearic acid concentrations, impaired EPC migration and EPC/BM-HC proliferation through a PPARγ-mediated STAT5 transcription inhibition. This event did not prevent the formation of a STAT5/PPARγ transcriptional complex but was crucial for gene targeting, as p21(Waf) gene promoter, unlike cyclin D1, was the STAT5/PPARγ transcriptional target. Similar molecular events could be detected in EPCs isolated from type 2 diabetic patients. By expressing a constitutively activated STAT5 form, we demonstrated that STAT5 content is crucial for gene targeting and EPC fate. Finally, we also provide in vivo data that d-PA-mediated EPC dysfunction could be rescued by PPARγ blockade. These data provide first insights on how mechanistically d-PA drives EPC/BM-HC dysfunction in diabetes.
16455797	Structures of wild-type and mutant human spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase, a potential therapeutic drug target.	Spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) is a key enzyme in the control of polyamine levels in human cells, as acetylation of spermidine and spermine triggers export or degradation. Increased intracellular polyamine levels accompany several types of cancers as well as other human diseases, and compounds that affect the expression, activity, or stability of SSAT are being explored as potential therapeutic drugs. We have expressed human SSAT from the cloned cDNA in Escherichia coli and have determined high-resolution structures of wild-type and mutant SSAT, as the free dimer and in binary and ternary complexes with CoA, acetyl-CoA (AcCoA), spermine, and the inhibitor N1,N11bis-(ethyl)-norspermine (BE-3-3-3). These structures show details of binding sites for cofactor, substrates, and inhibitor and provide a framework to understand enzymatic activity, mutations, and the action of potential drugs. Two dimer conformations were observed: a symmetric form with two open surface channels capable of binding substrate or cofactor, and an asymmetric form in which only one of the surface channels appears capable of binding and acetylating polyamines. SSAT was found to self-acetylate lysine-26 in the presence of AcCoA and absence of substrate, a reaction apparently catalzyed by AcCoA bound in the second channel of the asymmetric dimer. These unexpected and intriguing complexities seem likely to have some as yet undefined role in regulating SSAT activity or stability as a part of polyamine homeostasis. Sequence signatures group SSAT with proteins that appear to have thialysine Nepsilon-acetyltransferase activity.
22080037	Mercury induces the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase.	Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is a transcription factor that mediates the inducible expression of a variety of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses. NF-κB activation induces numerous proinflammatory gene products including cytokines, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). The divalent heavy metal mercury has been used for thousands of years. Although mercury is clearly toxic to most mammalian organ systems, especially the immune system, exposure has still increased in some areas of the world. However, the underlying toxic mechanism is not clearly identified. Here, we report biochemical evidence that mercury alone induces NF-κB activation, resulting in the induced expression of COX-2 and iNOS. The results suggest that mercury can induce inflammatory diseases by lowering host defense.
23103283	Mancozeb-induced behavioral deficits precede structural neural degeneration.	Manganese-containing fungicides like Mancozeb have been associated with neurodegenerative conditions like Parkinson's disease. We examined the behavioral damage and differential neuronal vulnerability resulting from Mancozeb exposure using Caenorhabditis elegans, an important mid-trophic level soil organism that is also a powerful model for studying mechanisms of environmental pollutant-induced neurodegenerative disease. The dopamine-mediated swim to crawl locomotory transition behavior is exquisitely vulnerable to Mancozeb, with functional impairment preceding markers of neuronal structural damage. The damage is partially rescued in mutants lacking the divalent metal transporter, SMF-1, demonstrating that some, but not all, of the damage is mediated by manganese. Increasing concentrations of Mancozeb recruit additional behavioral dysfunction, notably serotonin-mediated egg-laying behavior, but without evident serotonergic neuronal structural damage. Thus, measurements of behavioral dysfunction are a sensitive early marker of fungicide toxicity that could be exploited to examine further mechanisms of neuron damage and possible therapeutic interventions. These results also provide important insight into the consequences of fungicide use on the ecological behavior of nematodes.
23117572	Sodium/iodide symporter is expressed in the majority of seminomas and embryonal testicular carcinomas.	Testicular cancer is the most frequent cancer in young men. The large majority of patients have a good prognosis, but in a small group of tumors, the current treatments are not effective. Radioiodine is routinely used in the treatment of thyroid cancer and is currently investigated as a potential therapeutic tool even for extra-thyroid tumors able to concentrate this radioisotope. Expression of Na(+)/I(-) symporter (NIS (SLC5A5)), the glycoprotein responsible for iodide transport, has been demonstrated in normal testicular tissue. In this study, we analyzed NIS expression in a large series of testicular carcinomas. Our retrospective series included 107 patients operated for testicular tumors: 98 typical seminomas, six embryonal carcinomas, one mixed embryonal choriocarcinoma, and two Leydig cells tumors. Expression and regulation of NIS mRNA and protein levels were also investigated in human embryonal testicular carcinoma cells (NTERA) by real-time RT-PCR and western blotting respectively. Immunohistochemical analysis showed the presence of NIS in the large majority of seminomas (90/98) and embryonal carcinomas (5/7) of the testis but not in Leydig cell carcinomas. Expression of NIS protein was significantly associated with lymphovascular invasion. In NTERA cells treated with the histone deacetylase inhibitors SAHA and valproic acid, a significant increase in NIS mRNA (about 60- and 30-fold vs control, P<0.001 and P<0.01 respectively) and protein levels, resulting in enhanced ability to uptake radioiodine, was observed. Finally, NIS expression in testicular tumors with the more aggressive behavior is of interest for the potential use of targeting NIS to deliver radioiodine in malignant cells.
12907245	The JNK, ERK and p53 pathways play distinct roles in apoptosis mediated by the antitumor agents vinblastine, doxorubicin, and etoposide.	Assessment of specific apoptosis and survival pathways implicated in anticancer drug action is important for understanding drug mechanisms and modes of resistance in order to improve the benefits of chemotherapy. In order to better examine the role of mitogen-activated protein kinases, including JNK and ERK, as well as the tumor suppressor p53, in the response of tumor cells to chemotherapy, we compared the effects on these pathways of three structurally and functionally distinct antitumor agents. Drug concentrations equal to 50 times the concentration required to reduce cell proliferation by 50% were used. Vinblastine, doxorubicin, or etoposide (VP-16) induced apoptotic cell death in KB-3 carcinoma cells, with similar kinetic profiles of PARP cleavage, caspase 3 activation, and mitochondrial cytochrome c release. All three drugs strongly activated JNK, but only vinblastine induced c-Jun phosphorylation and AP-1 activation. Inhibition of JNK by SP600125 protected cells from drug-induced cytotoxicity. Vinblastine caused inactivation of ERK whereas ERK was unaffected in cells exposed to doxorubicin or VP-16. Inhibition of ERK signaling by the MEK inhibitor, U0126, potentiated the cytotoxic effects of vinblastine and doxorubicin, but not that of VP-16. Vinblastine induced p53 downregulation, and chemical inhibition of p53 potentiated vinblastine-induced cell death, suggesting a protective effect of p53. In contrast, doxorubicin and VP-16 induced p53, and inhibition of p53 decreased drug-induced cell death, suggesting a pro-apoptotic role for p53. These results highlight the differential roles played by several key signal transduction pathways in the mechanisms of action of key antitumor agents, and suggest ways to specifically potentiate their effects in a context-dependent manner. In addition, the novel finding that JNK activation can occur without c-Jun phosphorylation or AP-1 activation has important implications for our understanding of JNK function.
23631440	Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors Based on the 3-Mercaptopyrrolidine Core.	New series of pyrrolidine mercaptosulfide, 2-mercaptocyclopentane arylsulfonamide, and 3-mercapto-4-arylsulfonamido pyrrolidine matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors (MMPIs) were designed, synthesized, and evaluated. Exhibiting unique properties over other MMPIs (e.g., hydroxamates), these newly reported compounds are capable of modulating activities of several MMPs in the low nanomolar range, including MMP-2 (~2 to 50 nM), MMP-13 (~2 to 50 nM), and MMP-14 (~4 to 60 nM). Additionally these compounds are selective to intermediate- and deep-pocket MMPs but not shallow-pocketed MMPs (e.g., MMP-1, ~850 to >50,000 nM; MMP-7, ~4,000 to >25,000 nM). Our previous work with the mercaptosulfide functionality attached to both cyclopentane and pyrrolidine frameworks demonstrated that the cis-(3S,4R)- stereochemistry was optimal for all of the MMPs tested. However, in our newest compounds an interesting shift of preference to the trans- form of the mercaptosulfonamides was observed with increased oxidative stability and biological compatibility. We also report several kinetic and biological characteristics showing that these compounds may be used to probe the mechanistic activities of MMPs in disease.
15840408	Differential effect of prostaglandins E1 and E2 on lipopolysaccharide-induced adhesion molecule expression on human monocytes.	The effect of prostaglandins E1 and E2 on the 1 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, B7.1, B7.2, CD40 and CD40 ligand (CD40L) on monocytes was examined. Prostaglandin E1 suppressed B7.1 and CD40 expression, but prostaglandin E2 did not effect on any type of adhesion molecule expression. Both prostaglandins inhibited tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha production and T-cell proliferation of lipopolysaccharide-treated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Among prostaglandin E1 receptors (IP/EP1/EP2/EP3/EP4) agonists, ONO-1301, a prostanoid IP-receptor agonist, prevented B7.1 and CD40 expression. ONO-AE1-259-01 a prostanoid EP2-receptor agonist, ONO-AE1-329, a prostanoid EP4-receptor agonist, and ONO-1301 inhibited TNF-alpha production and T-cell proliferation. Moreover, anti-B7.1 and anti-CD40 Abs prevented lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF-alpha production and T-cell proliferation. Therefore, the effect of prostaglandin E1 on TNF-alpha production and T-cell proliferation might depend on the inhibition of B7.1 and CD40 expression, but that of prostaglandin E2 might be independent of adhesion molecules expression. In conclusion, the mechanism responsible for the effect of prostaglandin E1 on lipopolysaccharide-induced responses is distinct from that of prostaglandin E2.
23123771	An Indian butyrylcholinesterase variant L307P is not structurally stable: A molecular dynamics simulation study.	The human butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity is less than 1% in the serum of silent variant individuals of Vysya community in India. They are homozygous for a point mutation at codon 307 (CTT→CCT) resulting in the substitution of leucine 307 by proline. The reason for the disappearance of the protein in the serum has not been explicated till date. Based on this background, we performed molecular dynamics simulation to probe the structural stability of Indian variant (L307P) in comparison with wild and other BChE variants (D70G, E497V, V142M) having differential esterase activity. The simulation of all the mutants except D70G showed a much larger Cα root mean square deviation from the wild BChE crystal structure, showing the overall conformational disturbance. Further analysis revealed that secondary structure of the mutant proteins was not stable. The orientation of the catalytic triad is also distorted in all the mutants. The distance between δ nitrogen of His438 to ε oxygen of Glu325 and ε nitrogen of His438 to γ oxygen of Ser198 were highly altered in L307P mutant than the wild and other three variants throughout the simulation. Such disparity of distances between the catalytic residues may be due to the change in the protein conformation attributing to their differential catalytic activity. Our studies thus prove that the Indian BChE L307P mutant with negligible activity is possibly due to its structural instability when compared to other BChE variants.
18574460	High-affinity blockade of voltage-operated skeletal muscle and neuronal sodium channels by halogenated propofol analogues.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Voltage-operated sodium channels constitute major target sites for local anaesthetic-like action. The clinical use of local anaesthetics is still limited by severe side effects, in particular, arrhythmias and convulsions. These side effects render the search for new local anaesthetics a matter of high interest. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We have investigated the effects of three halogenated structural analogues of propofol on voltage-operated human skeletal muscle sodium channels (Na(V)1.4) and the effect of one compound (4-chloropropofol) on neuronal sodium channels (Na(V)1.2) heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney cell line 293. KEY RESULTS: 4-Iodo-, 4-bromo- and 4-chloropropofol reversibly suppressed depolarization-induced whole-cell sodium inward currents with high potency. The IC(50) for block of resting channels at -150 mV was 2.3, 3.9 and 11.3 microM in Na(V)1.4, respectively, and 29.2 microM for 4-chloropropofol in Na(V)1.2. Membrane depolarization inducing inactivation strongly increased the blocking potency of all compounds. Estimated affinities for the fast-inactivated channel state were 81 nM, 312 nM and 227 nM for 4-iodopropofol, 4-bromopropofol and 4-chloropropofol in Na(V)1.4, and 450 nM for 4-chloropropofol in Na(V)1.2. Recovery from fast inactivation was prolonged in the presence of drug leading to an accumulation of block during repetitive stimulation at high frequencies (100 Hz). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Halogenated propofol analogues constitute a novel class of sodium channel-blocking drugs possessing almost 100-fold higher potency compared with the local anaesthetic and anti-arrhythmic drug lidocaine. Preferential drug binding to inactivated channel states suggests that halogenated propofol analogues might be especially effective in suppressing ectopic discharges in a variety of pathological conditions.
22776694	Passive stiffness of airway smooth muscle: the next target for improving airway distensibility and treatment for asthma?	Reduced airway distensibility due to increased airway stiffness is a characteristic of asthma. Airway stiffness is determined by the property and structural organization of the various elements of the airway wall, and is often divided into active and passive components. Active stiffness is thought to be associated with activation of muscle cells in the airway wall. This component of stiffness can be inhibited when active force produced by the muscle is abolished. Passive stiffness, on the other hand, is thought to stem from non-muscle component of the airway wall, especially the collagen/elastin fibrous network of the extracellular matrix within which the muscle cells are embedded. In this brief review, the notion that passive stiffness is exclusively extracellular in origin is challenged. Recent evidence suggests that a substantial portion of the passive stiffness of an in vitro preparation of tracheal smooth muscle is calcium sensitive and is regulated by Rho-kinase, although the underlying mechanism and the details of regulation for the development of this intracellular passive stiffness are still largely unknown. To reduce airway stiffness different lines of attack must be tailored to different components of the stiffness. The regulatable passive stiffness is distinct from the relatively permanent stiffness of the extracellular matrix and the stiffness associated with active muscle contraction. To improve airway distensibility during asthma exacerbation, a comprehensive approach to reduce overall airway stiffness should therefore include a strategy for targeting the regulatable passive stiffness.
23623823	Recent advances in quantitative neuroproteomics.	The field of proteomics is undergoing rapid development in a number of different areas including improvements in mass spectrometric platforms, peptide identification algorithms and bioinformatics. In particular, new and/or improved approaches have established robust methods that not only allow for in-depth and accurate peptide and protein identification and modification, but also allow for sensitive measurement of relative or absolute quantitation. These methods are beginning to be applied to the area of neuroproteomics, but the central nervous system poses many specific challenges in terms of quantitative proteomics, given the large number of different neuronal cell types that are intermixed and that exhibit distinct patterns of gene and protein expression. This review highlights the recent advances that have been made in quantitative neuroproteomics, with a focus on work published over the last five years that applies emerging methods to normal brain function as well as to various neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia and drug addiction as well as of neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. While older methods such as two-dimensional polyacrylamide electrophoresis continued to be used, a variety of more in-depth MS-based approaches including both label (ICAT, iTRAQ, TMT, SILAC, SILAM), label-free (label-free, MRM, SWATH) and absolute quantification methods, are rapidly being applied to neurobiological investigations of normal and diseased brain tissue as well as of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). While the biological implications of many of these studies remain to be clearly established, that there is a clear need for standardization of experimental design and data analysis, and that the analysis of protein changes in specific neuronal cell types in the central nervous system remains a serious challenge, it appears that the quality and depth of the more recent quantitative proteomics studies is beginning to shed light on a number of aspects of neuroscience that relates to normal brain function as well as of the changes in protein expression and regulation that occurs in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.
11535580	Gating-dependent mechanisms for flecainide action in SCN5A-linked arrhythmia syndromes.	"BACKGROUND: Mutations in the cardiac sodium (Na) channel gene (SCN5A) give rise to the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQT3) and the Brugada syndrome. Na channel blockade by antiarrhythmic drugs improves the QT interval prolongation in LQT3 but worsens the Brugada syndrome ST-segment elevation. Although Na channel blockade has been proposed as a treatment for LQT3, flecainide also evokes ""Brugada-like"" ST-segment elevation in LQT3 patients. Here, we examine how Na channel inactivation gating defects in LQT3 and Brugada syndrome elicit proarrhythmic sensitivity to flecainide. METHODS AND RESULTS: We measured whole-cell Na current (I(Na)) from tsA-201 cells transfected with DeltaKPQ, a LQT3 mutation, and 1795insD, a mutation that provokes both the LQT3 and Brugada syndromes. The 1795insD and DeltaKPQ channels both exhibited modified inactivation gating (from the closed state), thus potentiating tonic I(Na) block. Flecainide (1 micromol/L) tonic block was only 16.8+/-3.0% for wild type but was 58.0+/-6.0% for 1795insD (P<0.01) and 39.4+/-8.0% (P<0.05) for DeltaKPQ. In addition, the 1795insD mutation delayed recovery from inactivation by enhancing intermediate inactivation, with a 4-fold delay in recovery from use-dependent flecainide block. CONCLUSIONS: We have linked 2 inactivation gating defects (""closed-state"" fast inactivation and intermediate inactivation) to flecainide sensitivity in patients carrying LQT3 and Brugada syndrome mutations. These results provide a mechanistic rationale for predicting proarrhythmic sensitivity to flecainide based on the identification of specific SCN5A inactivation gating defects."
11451212	In vitro and in vivo pharmacology of olmesartan medoxomil, an angiotensin II type AT1 receptor antagonist.	Olmesartan medoxomil is a new non-peptide angiotensin (A) II antagonist under development for treating hypertension. It is a pro-drug containing an ester moiety that, after oral administration, is rapidly cleaved to release the active form olmesartan (RNH-6270). In vitro, olmesartan is a highly potent, competitive and selective All AT1 receptor antagonist with almost no antagonistic activity on AT2 and AT4 receptors. Olmesartan produces selective insurmountable inhibition of All-induced contractions of the guinea-pig aorta and is much more potent than losartan in reducing maximal responses. In vivo, intravenous olmesartan produces a rapid and long-lasting inhibition of All-induced pressor responses in conscious rats. Oral olmesartan medoxomil also inhibits All-pressor response but onset of the action is slower compared with intravenous administration. Following oral administration, olmesartan has a faster onset but similar potency when compared with candesartan cilexetil, and clearly exceeds losartan in both respects. Oral olmesartan medoxomil exhibits dose-dependent antihypertensive effects in several rat and dog models, with the most marked effects seen in high plasma renin models, when compared with normal or low renin types. Haemodynamic studies in spontaneously hypertensive rats and normotensive dogs showed intravenous olmesartan selectively reduces renal vascular resistance, which suggests that vasodilatation in the renal vascular bed contributes most to the antihypertensive action of the drug. Long-term treatment with olmesartan medoxomil exhibits, beside antihypertensive effects, beneficial effects in animal models of various types of nephrosis and heart failure, and anti-atherogenic effects in hyperlipidaemic animals. Olmesartan medoxomil is worthy of clinical development in essential and renal hypertension, particularly where renal function is threatened by underlying diabetic disease.
16368957	Dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase is critical for Mycobacterium tuberculosis pathogenesis.	Mycobacterium tuberculosis has evolved to persist in host macrophages, where it faces a nutrient-poor environment and is exposed to oxidative and nitrosative stress. To defend itself against oxidative/nitrosative stress, M. tuberculosis expresses an NADH-dependent peroxidase and peroxynitrite reductase that is encoded by ahpC, ahpD, lpd, and dlaT. In addition to its central role in the peroxynitrite reductase complex, dlaT (Rv2215) also encodes the E2 component of pyruvate dehydrogenase. Here we demonstrate that inactivation of dlaT in the chromosome of H37Rv resulted in a mutant (H37RvDeltadlaT) that displayed phenotypes associated with DlaT's role in metabolism and in defense against nitrosative stress. The H37RvDeltadlaT strain showed retarded growth in vitro and was highly susceptible to killing by acidified sodium nitrite. Mouse macrophages readily killed intracellular H37RvDeltadlaT organisms, and in mice dlaT was required for full virulence.
23368901	Influence of chain length and double bond on the aqueous behavior of choline carboxylate soaps.	"In preceding studies, we demonstrated that choline carboxylates ChC(m) with alkyl chain lengths of m = 12 - 18 are highly water-soluble (for m = 12, soluble up to 93 wt % soap and 0 °C). In addition, choline soaps are featured by an extraordinary lyotropic phase behavior. With decreasing water concentration, the following phases were found: micellar phase (L(1)), discontinuous cubic phase (I(1)' and I(1)""), hexagonal phase (H(1)), bicontinuous cubic phase (V(1)), and lamellar phase (L(α)). The present work is also focused on the lyotropic phase behavior of choline soaps but with shorter alkyl chains or different alkyl chain properties. We have investigated the aqueous phase behavior of choline soaps with C(8) and C(10) chain-lengths (choline octanoate and choline decanoate) and with a C(18) chain-length with a cis-double bond (choline oleate). We found that choline decanoate follows the lyotropic phase behavior of the longer-chain homologues mentioned above. Choline octanoate in water shows no discontinuous cubic phases, but an extended, isotropic micellar solution phase. In addition, choline octanoate is at the limit between a surfactant and a hydrotrope. The double bond in choline oleate leads also to a better solubility in water and a decrease of the solubilization temperature. It also influences the Gaussian curvature of the aggregates which results in a loss of discontinuous cubic phases in the binary phase diagram. The different lyotropic mesophases were identified by the penetration scan technique with polarizing light microscope and visual observations. To clarify the structural behavior small (SAXS) and wide (WAXS) angle X-ray scattering were performed. To further characterize the extended, isotropic micellar solution phase in the binary phase diagram of choline octanoate viscosity and conductivity measurements were also carried out."
11406192	Binding of an AMPA receptor potentiator ([3H]LY395153) to native and recombinant AMPA receptors.	LY395153 is a member of a newly described class of arylpropylsulfonamide AMPA receptor potentiators. Here, we characterize and compare [(3)H]LY395153 binding to native AMPA receptors from rat cerebral cortex and recombinant human GluR4(flip) receptors expressed in HEK293 cells. L-Glutamate and AMPA increased [(3)H]LY395153 binding to both native and recombinant AMPA receptors in a concentration dependent and stereoselective manner; this effect of AMPA receptor agonists reflects an apparent increase in ligand affinity. In the presence of L-glutamate (500 microM), [(3)H]LY395153 binding is saturable; the affinity of this radioligand is slightly, albeit statistically significantly higher at human GluR4(flip) (K(d)=55.6+/-5.3nM) than rat cortical receptors (K(d)=110+/-15.1nM). NBQX competitively inhibited L-glutamate-induced increases in [(3)H]LY395153 binding in both native and recombinant receptors, whilst LY303070 (the active isomer of GYKI53655) noncompetitively inhibited this effect in native, but not recombinant receptors. The prototypic AMPA receptor potentiator cyclothiazide competitively inhibited [(3)H]LY395153 binding with a potency (K(i) approximately 7 microM) comparable to EC(50) values reported in electrophysiological studies. In contrast, the structurally unrelated AMPA receptor potentiator CX 516 did not inhibit [(3)H]LY395153 binding at concentrations of up to 600 microM. Further, at concentrations reported to facilitate AMPA receptor desensitization, thiocyanate acts as a competitive inhibitor of [(3)H]LY395153 binding. [(3)H]LY395153 binding was unaffected by a variety of structurally (and mechanistically) diverse compounds tested at a concentration of 10 microM. These data indicate [(3)H]LY395153 is a useful probe for labeling a unique modulatory site on both native and recombinant AMPA receptors.
8827452	Purification and characterization of a novel hyaluronan-binding protein (PHBP) from human plasma: it has three EGF, a kringle and a serine protease domain, similar to hepatocyte growth factor activator.	A novel hyaluronan-binding protein (PHBP) was purified from human plasma by affinity chromatography on hyaluronan-conjugated Sepharose. The contaminating IgM and albumin in the partially purified preparation were removed with anti-IgG antibody-conjugated Sepharose and anti-albumin antibody-conjugated Sepharose, respectively, and no other contaminant was observed. Finally, 800 micrograms of PHBP was isolated from 500 ml of human plasma. PHBP gave a single 70-kDa band on SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions, and 50-kDa and 17-kDa bands under reducing conditions. Thus, PHBP was a heterodimer composed of 50-kDa and 17-kDa subunits, bridged by a disulfide linkage. Both subunits had novel N-terminal amino acid sequences, indicating that PHBP was a novel hyaluronan-binding protein in human plasma. The amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the cloned PHBP cDNA exhibited significant homology to that of hepatocyte growth factor activator (HGFA). The results of Northern blot analysis indicated that liver, kidney, and pancreas expressed PHBP mRNA. The predicted structure of PHBP showed three epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains, a kringle domain and a serine protease domain, from its N-terminus, although HGFA has a fibronectin type II domain, an EGF domain, a fibronectin type I domain, an EGF domain, a kringle domain, and a serine protease domain, from its N-terminus.
23588308	A Physiologically-Based Pharmacokinetic Modelling Approach to Predict Disease-Drug Interactions: Suppression of CYP3A by IL-6.	Elevated cytokine levels can down-regulate expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) and suppress their activity. Treatment of inflammation or infection with cytokine-modulating therapeutic proteins (TP) could reverse suppression manifesting as therapeutic protein-drug drug interactions (TP-DDI). A physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model was used to quantitatively predict the impact of IL-6 on sensitive CYP3A4 substrates. Elevated simvastatin AUC in virtual rheumatoid arthritis patients, following 100 pg/mL of IL-6 was comparable to observed clinical data (59% versus 58%). In virtual bone marrow transplant (BMT) patients, 500 pg/ml of IL-6 resulted in increase in cyclosporine AUC that was in good agreement with the observed data (45% versus 39%). In a different group of BMT patients treated with cyclosporine, the magnitude of interaction with IL-6 was under predicted ~3-fold. The complexity of TP-DDI highlights underlying pathophysiological factors to be considered but these simulations provide valuable first steps towards predictions of TP-DDI risk.Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics (2013); accepted article preview online 10 April 2013 doi:10.1038/clpt.2013.79.
17629760	Muscular dystrophy associated mutations in caveolin-1 induce neurotransmission and locomotion defects in Caenorhabditis elegans.	Mutations in human caveolin-3 are known to underlie a range of myopathies. The cav-1 gene of Caenorhabditis elegans is a homologue of human caveolin-3 and is expressed in both neurons and body wall muscles. Within the body wall muscle CAV-1 localises adjacent to neurons, most likely at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Using fluorescently tagged CAV-1 and pre- and post-synaptic markers we demonstrate that CAV-1 co-localises with UNC-63, a post-synaptic marker, but not with several pre-synaptic markers. To establish a model for human muscular dystrophies caused by dominant-negative mutations in caveolin-3 we created transgenic animals carrying versions of cav-1 with homologous mutations. These animals had increased sensitivity to levamisole, suggesting a role for cav-1 at the NMJ. Animals carrying a deletion in cav-1 show a similar sensitivity. Sensitivity to levamisole and locomotion were also perturbed in animals carrying a dominant-negative cav-1 and a mutation in dynamin, which is a protein known to interact with caveolins. Thus, indicating an interaction between CAV-1 and dynamin at the NMJ and/or in neurons.
17606858	Effects of fenofibrate on cardiac remodeling in aldosterone-induced hypertension.	Hypertension and cardiac remodeling are associated with myocardial fibrosis, left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, and diastolic heart failure. Fenofibrate suppresses aldosterone-mediated increases in myocyte matrix metalloproteinase activity and extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation. It is unknown whether the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha agonist, fenofibrate, improves cardiac remodeling in a model of aldosterone-induced hypertension and LV hypertrophy. Twelve-week-old uninephrectomized FVB mice received 1% NaCl drinking water. Miniosmotic pumps delivered saline or aldosterone for 4 weeks. Mice were either untreated (n=14) or treated with fenofibrate 100 mg/kg per day (n=12) for 1 week before and 4 weeks after surgery. Aldosterone increased systolic blood pressure in untreated mice versus saline-untreated mice (134+/-3 versus 91+/-3 mm Hg; P<0.01). This was unaffected by fenofibrate (131+/-3 mm Hg). Aldosterone increased LV end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions, which were significantly attenuated by fenofibrate (3.8+/-0.1 versus 3.5+/-0.1 mm, and 1.5+/-0.1 versus 1.15+/-0.1 mm, respectively). Fenofibrate also decreased aldosterone-induced LV hypertrophy (LV weight/body weight, 4.1+/-0.2 versus 4.6+/-0.1 mg/g) and improved percent LV fractional shortening (67+/-7% versus 60+/-2%). Additionally, fenofibrate ameliorated the increased matrix metalloproteinase-2/tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-2 ratio and fibrosis seen in aldosterone-untreated hearts (P<0.05 for both). Furthermore, in aldosterone-untreated hearts, fenofibrate decreased transforming growth factor-beta, collagen type III (P<0.05 for both), and collagen type I (P<0.01) protein expression. Conversely fenofibrate increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha expression, and acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase phosphorylation (P<0.05 for all) in aldosterone-infused hearts; uncoupling protein-3 and medium-chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase protein expression decreased with fenofibrate (P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively, versus aldosterone-infused), suggesting that improved myocardial remodeling is independent of fatty acid oxidation. Thus, fenofibrate improved aldosterone-induced LV hypertrophy independently of an effect on blood pressure with decreased fibrosis and altered extracellular matrix.
23645360	Differential regulation of Arabidopsis plastid gene expression and RNA editing in non-photosynthetic tissues.	RNA editing is one of the post-transcriptional processes that commonly occur in plant plastids and mitochondria. In Arabidopsis, 34 C-to-U RNA editing events, affecting transcripts of 18 plastid genes, have been identified. Here, we examined the editing and expression of these transcripts in different organs, and in green and non-green seedlings (etiolated, cia5-2, ispF and ispG albino mutants, lincomycin-, and norflurazon-treated). The editing efficiency of Arabidopsis plastid transcripts varies from site to site, and may be specifically regulated in different tissues. Steady state levels of plastid transcripts are low or undetectable in etiolated seedlings, but most editing sites are edited with efficiencies similar to those observed in green seedlings. By contrast, the editing of some sites is completely lost or significantly reduced in other non-green tissues; for instance, the editing of ndhB-149, ndhB-1255, and ndhD-2 is completely lost in roots and in lincomycin-treated seedlings. The editing of ndhD-2 is also completely lost in albino mutants and norflurazon-treated seedlings. However, matK-640 is completely edited, and accD-794, atpF-92, psbE-214, psbF-77, psbZ-50, and rps14-50 are completely or highly edited in both green and non-green tissues. In addition, the expression of nucleus-encoded RNA polymerase dependent transcripts is specifically induced by lincomycin, and the splicing of ndhB transcripts is significantly reduced in the albino mutants and inhibitor-treated seedlings. Our results indicate that plastid gene expression, and the splicing and editing of plastid transcripts are specifically and differentially regulated in various types of non-green tissues.
23489624	Novel small molecules as apoptosis inducers: synthesis, preliminary structure-activity relationships, and in vitro biological evaluation.	Inducing apoptosis is a promising therapeutic approach to overcome cancer. In this study, 30 compounds were synthesized and evaluated for their antiproliferative activity against three tumor cell lines in vitro: A875, H460 and Hela cancer cells by the MTT assay. The most potent analogue 7a, a novel compound was first reported by our group, inhibited the proliferation of A875 cells with an IC50 value of 98 nM. Flow cytometry analysis and morphological analysis suggested that compound 7a had potential anticancer efficacy via G2/M cell cycle arrest, which could be attributed to its proliferation and apoptosis, and also in a concentration-dependent manner. The SAR analysis indicated that the substituents R(2) played a crucial role in the antiproliferation activity.
17327465	Induction of cyp1a1 is a nonspecific biomarker of aryl hydrocarbon receptor activation: results of large scale screening of pharmaceuticals and toxicants in vivo and in vitro.	Expression of Cyp1a1 and its related enzyme activity have long been used as a biomarker for aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activation and a warning of dioxin-like toxicity. As a result, induction of Cyp1a1 by pharmaceutical drug candidates or environmental contaminants raises significant concern in risk assessment. The current study evaluates the specificity of Cyp1a1 induction as a marker for AhR affinity and activation and provides context to assess the relevancy of AhR activation to risk assessment. In vivo experiments examined the expression of Cyp1a1 and other AhR-regulated genes in liver, kidney, and heart in response to 596 compounds. From this data set, a subset of 147 compounds was then evaluated for their ability to activate or bind to the AhR using a combination of gel shift, reporter gene, and competitive receptor binding assays. Whereas in vivo Cyp1a1 mRNA expression is a sensitive marker for AhR activation, it lacks specificity, because 81 (59%) of 137 compounds were found to significantly induce Cyp1a1 in vivo but were not verified to bind or activate the AhR in vitro. Combining in vivo and in vitro findings, we identified nine AhR agonists, six of which are marketed therapeutics and have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, including leflunomide, flutamide, and nimodipine. These drugs do not produce dioxin-like toxicity in rats or in humans. These data demonstrate that induction of Cyp1a1 is a nonspecific biomarker of direct AhR affinity and activation and lend further support to the hypothesis that Cyp1a1 induction and/or AhR activation is not synonymous with dioxin-like toxicity.
20439738	Identification of select glucocorticoids as Smoothened agonists: potential utility for regenerative medicine.	Regenerative medicine holds the promise of replacing damaged tissues largely by stem cell activation. Hedgehog signaling through the plasma membrane receptor Smoothened (Smo) is an important process for regulating stem cell proliferation. The development of Hedgehog-related therapies has been impeded by a lack of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved Smo agonists. Using a high-content screen with cells expressing Smo receptors and a beta-arrestin2-GFP reporter, we identified four FDA-approved drugs, halcinonide, fluticasone, clobetasol, and fluocinonide, as Smo agonists that activate Hedgehog signaling. These drugs demonstrated an ability to bind Smo, promote Smo internalization, activate Gli, and stimulate the proliferation of primary neuronal precursor cells alone and synergistically in the presence of Sonic Hedgehog protein. Halcinonide, fluticasone, clobetasol, and fluocinonide provide an unprecedented opportunity to develop unique clinical strategies to treat Hedgehog-dependent illnesses.
23381936	Population pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin and its active metabolites in children and adolescents with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia: selective use of informative prior distributions from adults.	The population pharmacokinetics (PPK) of atorvastatin and its principal active metabolite, o-hydroxyatorvastatin, were described in 6-17 years old pediatric hypercholesterolemia patients with a 2-compartment model for both parent and metabolite. Informative prior distributions on selected parameters, based on adult data, were required to stabilize the model and were implemented using a Bayesian penalty term on the likelihood function in the nonlinear mixed effects model (NONMEM VI with PRIOR). Concentrations below the limit of quantitation were treated as censored data using a conditional likelihood function. Atorvastatin apparent oral clearance (CL/F) was described as a function of body weight using an allometric equation. Based on the final model, the typical CL/F estimates for a Tanner Stage 1 patient (35 kg weight) and Tanner Stage ≥2 (50 kg weight), would be 553 and 543 L/hour, respectively. When scaled allometrically, CL/F was similar to values reported for adults. Variability in atorvastatin PK was primarily affected by weight.
2855105	Loperamide, an opiate analog, differently modifies the adrenocorticotropin responses to corticotropin-releasing hormone and lysine vasopressin in patients with Addison's disease.	Loperamide is a peripheral opiate agonist able to inhibit ACTH secretion. In this work, the interactions between loperamide and two ACTH secretagogues, lysine vasopressin (LVP) and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), were investigated in patients with Addison's disease. After loperamide (16 mg orally) or placebo administration, 5 patients received LVP (0.06 IU/kg i.v. over 1 h) and 6 patients received oCRH (1 micrograms/kg i.v. as bolus). In all patients loperamide induced a significant fall in plasma ACTH levels. LVP increased ACTH levels after both loperamide (from 48 +/- 17.3 to a peak of 95 +/- 21 pmol/l) and placebo (from 231 +/- 59.5 to 365 +/- 86.6 pmol/l): the interaction between treatments and time was not significant. CRH caused a rise in plasma ACTH after both loperamide (from 30 +/- 16.6 to a peak of 108 +/- 31 pmol/l) and placebo (from 98.5 +/- 47 to 211 +/- 61.7 pmol/l): the interaction between treatments and time was significant, and the first phase of CRH-induced ACTH secretion was significantly lower after loperamide. These data demonstrate that loperamide differently modifies the stimulatory action of LVP and CRH on ACTH secretion: namely, LVP and loperamide act in an additive manner, while CRH and loperamide interact in a non additive way. Although these findings might be explained by the involvement of different intracellular ACTH-secreting mechanisms, an influence of loperamide on some suprapituitary factors modulating the ACTH response is suggested.
17094966	Functional and molecular analysis of D-serine transport in retinal Muller cells.	D-serine, an endogenous co-agonist of NMDA receptors in vertebrate retina, may modulate glutamate sensitivity of retinal neurons. This study determined at the functional and molecular level the transport process responsible for D-serine in retinal Muller cells. RT-PCR and immunoblotting showed that serine racemase (SR), the synthesizing enzyme for D-serine, is expressed in the rMC-1 Muller cell line and primary cultures of mouse Muller cells (1 degrees MCs). The relative contributions of different amino acid transport systems to d-serine uptake were determined based on differential substrate specificities and ion dependencies. D-serine uptake was obligatorily dependent on Na+, eliminating Na+-independent transporters (asc-1 and system L) for D-serine in Muller cells. The Na+:substrate stoichiometry for the transport process was 1:1. D-serine transport was inhibited by alanine, serine, cysteine, glutamine, and asparagine, but not anionic amino acids or cationic amino acids, suggesting that D-serine transport in Muller cells occurs via ASCT2 rather than ASCT1 or ATB0,+. The expression of mRNAs specific for ASCT1, ASCT2, and ATB0,+ was analyzed by RT-PCR confirming the expression of ASCT2 (and ASCT1) mRNA, but not ATB0,+, in Muller cells. Immunoblotting detected ASCT2 in neural retina and in 1 degrees MCs; immunohistochemistry confirmed these data in retinal sections and in cultures of 1 degrees MCs. The efflux of D-serine via ASCT2 by ASCT2 substrates was demonstrable using the Xenopus laevis oocyte heterologous expression system. These data provide the first molecular evidence for SR and ASCT2 expression in a Muller cell line and in 1 degrees MCs and suggest that D-serine, synthesized in Muller cells by SR, is effluxed via ASCT2 to regulate NMDA receptors in adjacent neurons.
23628791	Down-regulation of LRRK2 in control and DAT transfected HEK cells increases manganese-induced oxidative stress and cell toxicity.	The extra-pyramidal symptoms associated with manganism often overlap with that seen in Parkinsonism suggesting a common link between the two disorders. Since wide deviations are observed in susceptibility and characteristics of the symptoms observed in manganism, these differences may be due to underlying genetic variability. Genes linked to early onset of Parkinsonism which includes ATP13A2 and parkin have already been suggested to promote development of Mn toxicity. Of the other Parkinson-linked genes, mutations in LRRK2, an autosomal dominant gene, represent another likely candidate involved in the development of manganism. In this paper the effect of shRNA LRRK2 knock-down on Mn toxicity was examined in control and DAT transfected HEK293 cells. Results demonstrate that LRRK2 down-regulation potentiates Mn toxicity in both control and DAT-transfected cell as well as potentiates DA toxicity. Combined treatment of Mn and DA further augments cell toxicity, ROS production and JNK phosphorylation in LRRK2 deficient cells compared to controls. Consistent with studies demonstrating that LRRK2 plays a role in the phosphorylation of p38, our results similarly demonstrate a decrease in p38 activation in LRRK2 knock-down cells. Our findings suggest that null mutations in LRRK2 which cause Parkinsonism potentiate Mn toxicity and increase susceptibility to develop manganism.
17510465	Activation of human platelets by misfolded proteins.	OBJECTIVE: Protein misfolding diseases result from the deposition of insoluble protein aggregates that often contain fibrils called amyloid. Amyloids are found in Alzheimer disease, atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, and systemic amyloidosis, which are diseases where platelet activation might be implicated. METHODS AND RESULTS: We induced amyloid properties in 6 unrelated proteins and found that all induced platelet aggregation in contrast to fresh controls. Amyloid-induced platelet aggregation was independent of thromboxane A2 formation and ADP secretion but enhanced by feedback stimulation through these pathways. Treatments that raised cAMP (iloprost), sequestered Ca2+ (BAPTA-AM) or prevented amyloid-platelet interaction (sRAGE, tissue-type plasminogen activator [tPA]) induced almost complete inhibition. Modulation of the function of CD36 (CD36-/- mice), p38(MAPK) (SB203580), COX-1 (indomethacin), and glycoprotein Ib alpha (Nk-protease, 6D1 antibody) induced approximately 50% inhibition. Interference with fibrinogen binding (RGDS) revealed a major contribution of alphaIIb beta3-independent aggregation (agglutination). CONCLUSIONS: Protein misfolding resulting in the appearance of amyloid induces platelet aggregation. Amyloid activates platelets through 2 pathways: one is through CD36, p38(MAPK), thromboxane A2-mediated induction of aggregation; the other is through glycoprotein Ib alpha-mediated aggregation and agglutination. The platelet stimulating properties of amyloid might explain the enhanced platelet activation observed in many diseases accompanied by the appearance of misfolded proteins with amyloid.
17046555	Activation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (reduced form) oxidase by advanced glycation end products links oxidative stress to altered retinal vascular endothelial growth factor expression.	Increasing evidence indicates that advanced glycation end products (AGEs) promote retinal alterations through oxidative stress. However, the pathways involved in AGE-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in retinal cells are poorly defined. In the present study, we investigated the role of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (reduced form) (NADPH) oxidase in AGE-induced ROS intracellular generation and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in bovine retinal endothelial cells (BRECs). Incubation of BRECs with 100 microg/mL AGEs increased ROS generation and VEGF expression in these cells. Treatment of the cells with the NADPH oxidase inhibitors, apocynin and diphenylene iodonium, inhibited these effects. In retinal endothelial cells exposed to AGEs, translocation of protein kinase C (PKC)-beta2 and p47phox was observed. Inhibition of PKC by treatment of the cells with calphostin C, GF10923X, and LY379196 totally suppressed AGE-mediated p47phox translocation and ROS generation. Incubation of BRECs with gliclazide inhibited AGE-induced PKC-beta2 and p47phox translocation and totally abrogated AGE-mediated ROS generation and VEGF expression. Overall, these results demonstrate that AGEs induce intracellular ROS generation and VEGF expression in retinal endothelial cells through a PKC-dependent activation of NADPH oxidase. Inhibition of retinal NADPH oxidase expression and ROS generated by this system provides a new potential mechanism by which gliclazide may affect retinal VEGF expression and exert a beneficial effect on diabetic retinopathy.
23160530	Gliotransmission and brain glucose sensing: critical role of endozepines.	Hypothalamic glucose sensing is involved in the control of feeding behavior and peripheral glucose homeostasis, and glial cells are suggested to play an important role in this process. Diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI) and its processing product the octadecaneuropeptide (ODN), collectively named endozepines, are secreted by astroglia, and ODN is a potent anorexigenic factor. Therefore, we investigated the involvement of endozepines in brain glucose sensing. First, we showed that intracerebroventricular administration of glucose in rats increases DBI expression in hypothalamic glial-like tanycytes. We then demonstrated that glucose stimulates endozepine secretion from hypothalamic explants. Feeding experiments indicate that the anorexigenic effect of central administration of glucose was blunted by coinjection of an ODN antagonist. Conversely, the hyperphagic response elicited by central glucoprivation was suppressed by an ODN agonist. The anorexigenic effects of centrally injected glucose or ODN agonist were suppressed by blockade of the melanocortin-3/4 receptors, suggesting that glucose sensing involves endozepinergic control of the melanocortin pathway. Finally, we found that brain endozepines modulate blood glucose levels, suggesting their involvement in a feedback loop controlling whole-body glucose homeostasis. Collectively, these data indicate that endozepines are a critical relay in brain glucose sensing and potentially new targets in treatment of metabolic disorders.
23578993	Effect of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), an organosulfur compound from Allium plants, on experimentally induced hepatic prefibrogenic events in wistar rat.	Aim of present study was to investigate the effect of NAC on experimental chronic hepatotoxicity models induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and thioacetamide (TAA). CCl4 toxicity was induced by administering 200μl CCl4 (diluted 2:3 in coconut oil)/100g body weight, p.o., twice weekly for 8 weeks. TAA toxicity was induced by administering 150mg/kg b. wt. of TAA i.p., twice weekly for 8 weeks. NAC treatment was started along with toxicants (CCl4 and TAA) for 8 weeks and continued for further 4 weeks. Self reversal group was kept without any treatment for 4 weeks after completion of toxicant treatments. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Bilirubin were measured in serum. Hydroxyproline (HP), lipid peroxidation (LPO), catalase (CAT), Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and Glutathione (GSH) were determined in liver samples by colorimetric methods. Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP 450 2E1), activity was determined as hydroxylation of aniline in liver microsomes. General examination and histological analysis were also performed. Serum markers of liver damage (AST, ALT, ALP and Bilirubin) were increased by CCl4 and TAA intoxication (p<0.001), whereas co-treatment with NAC reversed such changes (p<0.001). HP was enhanced in toxicant groups (p<0.001 in CCl4 and TAA), but inhibited by NAC (p<0.001). LPO was increased while as GSH, CAT and GPx decreased by the administration of CCl4 and TAA (p<0.001); co-administration of NAC restored these liver markers to normal levels (p<0.001). Biochemical determinations were corroborated by general and histological findings. Keeping in view the biochemical and histopathological studies, it was concluded that CCl4 and TAA are strong hepatotoxic agents that produce liver fibrosis with close proximity to human etiology (micronodular cirrhosis) and NAC has a significant protective activity against CCl4 and TAA. NAC has also been validated as a model against oxidative burden in chronic liver pathology.
23477570	In situ forming reduction-sensitive degradable nanogels for facile loading and triggered intracellular release of proteins.	In situ forming reduction-sensitive degradable nanogels were designed and developed based on poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(2-(hydroxyethyl) methacrylate-co-acryloyl carbonate) (PEG-P(HEMA-co-AC)) block copolymers for efficient loading as well as triggered intracellular release of proteins. PEG-P(HEMA-co-AC) copolymers were prepared with controlled Mn of 9.1, 9.5, and 9.9 kg/mol and varying numbers of AC units per molecule of 7, 9 and 11, respectively (denoted as copolymer 1, 2, and 3) by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer copolymerization. These copolymers were freely soluble in phosphate buffer but formed disulfide-cross-linked nanogels with defined sizes ranging from 72.5 to 124.1 nm in the presence of cystamine via ring-opening reaction with cyclic carbonate groups. The sizes of nanogels decreased with increasing AC units as a result of increased cross-linking density. Dynamic light scattering studies showed that these nanogels though stable at physiological conditions were rapidly dissociated in response to 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). Interestingly, FITC-labeled cytochrome C (FITC-CC) could be readily loaded into nanogels with remarkable loading efficiencies (up to 98.2%) and loading contents (up to 48.2 wt.%). The in vitro release studies showed that release of FITC-CC was minimal under physiological conditions but significantly enhanced under reductive conditions in the presence of 10 mM DTT with about 96.8% of FITC-CC released in 22 h from nanogel 1. In contrast, protein release from 1,4-butanediamine cross-linked nanogels (reduction-insensitive control) remained low under otherwise the same conditions. MTT assays showed that these nanogels were nontoxic to HeLa cells up to a tested concentration of 2 mg/mL. Confocal microscopy results showed that nanogel 1 delivered and released FITC-CC into the perinuclei region of HeLa cells following 8 h incubation. CC-loaded reductively degradable nanogels demonstrated apparently better apoptotic activity than free CC as well as reduction-insensitive controls. These in situ forming, surfactant and oil-free, and reduction-sensitive degradable nanogels are highly promising for targeted protein therapy.
12003347	Tetrahydrobiopterin in nitric oxide synthesis: a novel biological role for pteridines.	Ever since the discovery that (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-L-biopterin (BH4) is a cofactor of NOS, its function has been the object of intense research and occasional controversy. Only in the last couple of years a consensus has been reached on what constitutes the main role of BH4 in NO synthesis. In this review we aim to provide an outline of the various ways in which BH4 affects NOS catalysis. First we give a brief general description of the structure and catalytic mechanism of NOS, with special emphasis on those aspects of catalysis that are actively debated, and that directly or indirectly involve BH4. Foremost among those issues is uncoupled catalysis, i.e. the NOS-catalyzed oxidation of NADPH in the absence of substrate or pterin that does not result in NO production. We also shortly discuss the ongoing debate on whether NO is the actual reaction product of NOS catalysis, as well as the phenomenon of NO-mediated autoinhibition. We describe the function of BH4 in aromatic amino acid hydroxylation, and discuss the allosteric and structural effects that BH4 exerts on NOS. Next we turn our attention to what is now becoming accepted as the central function of BH4: its capacity to act as a 1-electron donor during reductive activation of the oxyferrous complex of the heme. Finally, we illustrate how BH4 might transform the NOS dimer into an efficient S-nitrosoglutathione synthase,and briefly touch on some more speculative aspects of the role of BH4 in NO synthesis.
14693528	Six-week randomized controlled trial to compare the tolerabilities, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activities of GW433908 and amprenavir in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected patients.	This study compared the plasma amprenavir pharmacokinetics of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitors amprenavir (Agenerase) 1,200 mg twice daily (BID) and the amprenavir prodrug GW433908, a formulation that substantially reduces the number of tablets per dose compared with amprenavir, at doses of 1,395 mg and 1,860 mg BID, in combination with abacavir 300 mg BID and lamivudine 150 mg BID in patients with HIV infection. Overall, 78 patients received study treatment. Compared with amprenavir 1,200 mg BID, both GW433908 1,395 mg BID and GW433908 1,860 mg BID delivered equivalent steady-state (ss) values for area under the plasma amprenavir concentration-time curve (AUC) at the end of a dosing interval (tau), lower maximum plasma amprenavir concentrations (30% lower), and higher plasma amprenavir concentrations at the end of a dosing interval (28% higher for GW433908 1,395 mg BID and 46% higher for GW433908 1,860 mg BID). Time-variant plasma amprenavir pharmacokinetics were observed with reductions in plasma amprenavir exposure over the first 4 weeks of dosing; the decrease in plasma amprenavir AUC(tau,ss) versus the AUC from 0 h to infinity was 27% for GW43308 1,395 mg, 45% for GW433908 1,860 mg, and 23% for amprenavir 1,200 mg. All three regimens reduced plasma HIV-1 RNA ( approximately 2 log(10) copies/ml) and increased CD4(+) cell counts ( approximately 100 cells/mm(3)) over the initial 28 days. Adverse event profiles were consistent with those previously reported for amprenavir. Although not statistically tested, the GW433908 groups appeared to have fewer gastrointestinal symptoms. In conclusion, the protease inhibitor GW433908 delivered comparable plasma amprenavir concentrations to those delivered by amprenavir 1,200 mg BID. GW433908, in combination with abacavir and lamivudine, demonstrated potent antiviral activity and was generally well tolerated over a 4-week period.
23604720	Aldose Reductase Inhibitory Compounds from Xanthium strumarium.	As part of our ongoing search for natural sources of therapeutic and preventive agents for diabetic complications, we evaluated the inhibitory effects of components of the fruit of Xanthium strumarium (X. strumarium) on aldose reductase (AR) and galactitol formation in rat lenses with high levels of glucose. To identify the bioactive components of X. strumarium, 7 caffeoylquinic acids and 3 phenolic compounds were isolated and their chemical structures were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic evidence and comparison with published data. The abilities of 10 X. strumarium-derived components to counteract diabetic complications were investigated by means of inhibitory assays with rat lens AR (rAR) and recombinant human AR (rhAR). From the 10 isolated compounds, methyl-3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinate showed the most potent inhibition, with IC50 values of 0.30 and 0.67 μM for rAR and rhAR, respectively. In the kinetic analyses using Lineweaver-Burk plots of 1/velocity and 1/substrate, methyl-3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinate showed competitive inhibition of rhAR. Furthermore, methyl-3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinate inhibited galactitol formation in the rat lens and in erythrocytes incubated with a high concentration of glucose, indicating that this compound may be effective in preventing diabetic complications.
23421877	Four new eudesmane-type sesquiterpenoid lactones from atractylenolide II by biotransformation of rat hepatic microsomes.	The biotransformation of atractylenolide II, a major bioactive principle of the rhizomes of Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz., was investigated in vitro by incubation with rat hepatic microsomes pretreated with sodium phenobarbital. The biotransformation products were extracted and purified by chromatographic methods. Seven biotransformation products (BP1-BP7) were obtained and their structures were elucidated by NMR and MS data analyses and by comparison with the previously reported values, including four new compounds, namely 4(R),15-epoxy-atractylenolide II (BP1), 4(R),15-epoxy-13-hydroxyatractylenolide II (BP5), 4(R),15-epoxy-1β-hydroxyatractylenolide II (BP6), and 4(R),15-dihydroxyatractylenolide II (BP7). The biotransformation pathway of atractylenolide II by hepatic microsomes was deducted based on the structure resolution of the products.
11501230	Clinical rationale for rosuvastatin, a potent new HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor.	Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death worldwide, and effective treatment of hyperlipidaemia can prevent development of CHD and significantly reduce the risk for cardiovascular events and mortality in this disease. The advent of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) has revolutionised the treatment of hyperlipidaemia, but many patients receiving these drugs still do not achieve their therapeutic goals. Rosuvastatin (Crestor; formerly ZD4522) is a new, potent and long-lasting inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase that is highly selective for hepatocytes. Its pharmacokinetics permit once-daily dosing, and a lack of oxidative hepatic metabolism results in a reduced potential for drug-drug interactions. Preliminary clinical results indicate that it produces rapid dose-related reductions in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B that may exceed those achieved with other currently available statins. Increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol have also been observed. Rosuvastatin is also well tolerated, with no evidence of either hepato- or myotoxicity. It is hoped that new agents such as rosuvastatin may help to reduce the high global morbidity, mortality and associated costs of CHD and related vascular disorders.
15581847	Reconstitution into liposomes of the glutamine/amino acid transporter from renal cell plasma membrane: functional characterization, kinetics and activation by nucleotides.	The glutamine/amino acid transporter was solubilized from rat renal apical plasma membrane (brush-border membrane) with C12E8 and reconstituted into liposomes by removing the detergent from mixed micelles by hydrophobic chromatography on Amberlite XAD-4. The reconstitution was optimised with respect to the protein concentration, the detergent/phospholipid ratio and the number of passages through a single Amberlite column. The reconstituted glutamine/amino acid transporter catalysed a first-order antiport reaction stimulated by external, not internal, Na+. Optimal activity was found at pH 7.0. The sulfhydryl reagents HgCl2, mersalyl and p-hydroxymercuribenzoate and the amino acids alanine, serine, threonine, cysteine, asparagine, methionine and valine strongly inhibited the transport, whereas the amino acid analogue methylaminoisobutyrate had no effect. Glutamine, alanine, serine, asparagine, threonine were efficiently translocated from outside to inside and from inside to outside the proteoliposomes as well. Cysteine and valine were translocated preferentially from outside to inside. The Km for glutamine on the external and internal side of the transporter was 0.47 and 11 mM, respectively; the values were not influenced by the type of the counter substrate. The transporter is functionally asymmetrical and it is unidirectionally inserted into the proteoliposomal membrane with an orientation corresponding to that of the native membrane. By a bisubstrate kinetic analysis of the glutamine antiport, a random simultaneous mechanism was found. The glutamine antiport was strongly stimulated by internal nucleoside triphosphates and, to a lower extent, by pyrophoshate. The reconstituted glutamine/amino acid transporter functionally corresponds to the ASCT2 protein.
23265543	Influence of nitrogen supply on the production of higher alcohols/esters and expression of flavour-related genes in cachaça fermentation.	This study provides the first attempt to analyse the influence of ammonium supplements on sugar-cane juice fermentation and the flavour profile in a cachaça industrial process. The objective was to find a relationship between higher alcohol/ester content and the transcription levels of the main genes involved in production of these compounds under cachaça fermentation. Sugar-cane juice with a low amount of assimilable nitrogen (81 mg N/L), was further supplemented with mid-range or high concentrations of ammonium sulfate. Overall, higher alcohol production was reduced by ammonium supplementation, and this can be correlated with a general downregulation of genes encoding decarboxylases and dehydrogenases of the Ehrlich pathway. The production of acetate esters was enhanced by mid-range ammonium supplementation and the production of acyl esters by high ammonium supplementation. The acyl esters could be correlated with expression of alcohol acyl-transferase EEB1 and the acyl esterase IAH1.
16245075	Effects of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and neutrophil elastase inhibitor (ONO-5046) on acid-induced lung injury in rats.	It has been suggested that neutrophils play an important role in acid-aspirated lung injury. We examined the effects of the high dose of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), which is capable of increasing peripheral neutrophils, and a specific neutrophil elastase inhibitor (ONO-5046) on acid lung injury in rats. Animals were anesthetized and normal saline (NS, 2 mL kg(-1)) or hydrochloric acid (HCl, 0.1 N 2 mL kg(-1)) was then instilled into trachea. Thirty minutes before HCl instillation, G-CSF (150 microg kg(-1)) was injected subcutaneously or ONO-5046 (10 mg kg(-1) h(-1)) was infused continuously into the right jugular vein. Animals were ventilated during the experiments. Five hours after HCl or NS instillation, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue samples were obtained. Total nuclear cell count, absorbance, albumin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC), neutrophil elastase in BALF, wet-to-dry (W/D) ratio were measured. HCl aspiration markedly increased these values in BALF and W/D ratio. Both ONO-5046 and G-CSF attenuated the parameters increased by acid-induced lung injury in rats. The data suggests that neutrophils play an important role in acid-induced lung injury. However, high-dose G-CSF does not exacerbate acid-aspirated lung injury in rats, although this agent causes an increase in peripheral neutrophils.
15814851	Aromatase inhibitors in the treatment of breast cancer.	Estradiol, the most potent endogenous estrogen, is biosynthesized from androgens by the cytochrome P450 enzyme complex called aromatase. Aromatase is present in breast tissue, and intratumoral aromatase is the source of local estrogen production in breast cancer tissues. Inhibition of aromatase is an important approach for reducing growth-stimulatory effects of estrogens in estrogen-dependent breast cancer. Steroidal inhibitors that have been developed to date build upon the basic androstenedione nucleus and incorporate chemical substituents at varying positions on the steroid. Nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors can be divided into three classes: aminoglutethimide-like molecules, imidazole/triazole derivatives, and flavonoid analogs. Mechanism-based aromatase inhibitors are steroidal inhibitors that mimic the substrate, are converted by the enzyme to a reactive intermediate, and result in the inactivation of aromatase. Both steroidal and nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors have shown clinical efficacy in the treatment of breast cancer. The potent and selective third-generation aromatase inhibitors, anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane, were introduced into the market as endocrine therapy in postmenopausal patients failing antiestrogen therapy alone or multiple hormonal therapies. These agents are currently approved as first-line therapy for the treatment of postmenopausal women with metastatic estrogen-dependent breast cancer. Several clinical studies of aromatase inhibitors are currently focusing on the use of these agents in the adjuvant setting for the treatment of early breast cancer. Use of an aromatase inhibitor as initial therapy or after treatment with tamoxifen is now recommended as adjuvant hormonal therapy for a postmenopausal woman with hormone-dependent breast cancer.
12445705	Atypical antipsychotic drugs, quetiapine, iloperidone, and melperone, preferentially increase dopamine and acetylcholine release in rat medial prefrontal cortex: role of 5-HT1A receptor agonism.	Preferential increases in both cortical dopamine (DA) and acetylcholine (ACh) release have been proposed to distinguish the atypical antipsychotic drugs (APDs) clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone and ziprasidone from typical APDs such as haloperidol. Although only clozapine and ziprasidone are directly acting 5-HT(1A) agonists, WAY100635, a selective 5-HT(1A) antagonist, partially attenuates these atypical APD-induced increases in cortical DA release that may be due to combined 5-HT(2A) and D(2) blockade. However, WAY100635 does not attenuate clozapine-induced cortical ACh release. The present study determined whether quetiapine, iloperidone and melperone, 5-HT(2A)/D(2) antagonist atypical APDs, also increase cortical DA and ACh release, and whether these effects are related to 5-HT(1A) agonism. Quetiapine (30 mg/kg), iloperidone (1-10 mg/kg), and melperone (3-10 mg/kg) increased DA and ACh release in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Iloperidone (10 mg/kg) and melperone (10 mg/kg), but not quetiapine (30 mg/kg), produced an equivalent or a smaller increase in DA release in the nucleus accumbens (NAC), respectively, compared to the mPFC, whereas none of them increased ACh release in the NAC. WAY100635 (0.2 mg/kg), which alone did not affect DA or ACh release, partially attenuated quetiapine (30 mg/kg)-, iloperidone (10 mg/kg)- and melperone (10 mg/kg)-induced DA release in the mPFC. WAY100635 also partially attenuated quetiapine (30 mg/kg)-induced ACh release in the mPFC, but not that induced by iloperidone (10 mg/kg) or melperone (10 mg/kg). These results indicate that quetiapine, iloperidone and melperone preferentially increase DA release in the mPFC, compared to the NAC via a 5-HT(1A)-related mechanism. However, 5-HT(1A) agonism may be important only for quetiapine-induced ACh release.
23561113	Anticancer activity and mediation of apoptosis in human HL-60 leukaemia cells by edible sea cucumber (Holothuria edulis) extract.	Sea cucumbers have been a dietary delicacy and important ingredient in Asian traditional medicinal over many centuries. In this study, edible sea cucumber Holothuria edulis was evaluated for its in vitro anticancer potential. An aqueous fraction of the edible sea cucumber (ESC-AQ) has been shown to deliver a strong cytotoxic effect against the human HL-60 leukaemia cell line. An induction effect of apoptotic body formation in response to ESC-AQ treatment was confirmed in HL-60 cells stained with Hoechst 33342 and confirmed via flow cytometry analysis. The up regulation of Bax and caspase-3 protein expression was observed while the expression of Bcl-xL protein was down regulated in ESC-AQ treated HL-60 cells. Due to the profound anticancer activity, ESC-AQ appears to be an economically important biomass fraction that can be exploited in numerous industrial applications as a source of functional ingredients.
23265504	Physico-chemical and antioxidant properties of four mango (Mangifera indica L.) cultivars in China.	Four principal mango cultivars (Tainong No.1, Irwin, JinHwang and Keitt) grown in southern China were selected, and their physico-chemical and antioxidant properties were characterized and compared. Of all the four cultivars, Tainong No.1 had highest content of total phenols, ρ-coumaric acid, sinapic acid, quercetin, titratable acidity, citric acid, malic acid, fructose, higher antioxidant activities (DPPH, FRAP) and L(*), lower pH, PPO activity and individual weight. Keitt mangoes showed significantly (p<0.05) higher contents of β-carotene, ρ-hydroxybenzoic acid, sucrose, total sugar, total soluble solid, catechin, succinic acid and higher PPO activity. JinHwang mangoes exhibited significantly (p<0.05) higher individual weight and PPO activity, but had lower content of total phenols, β-carotene and lower antioxidant activity. Principal component analysis (PCA) allowed the four mango cultivars to be differentiated clearly based on all these physico-chemical and antioxidant properties determined in the study.
15002740	The persistent membrane retention of desipramine causes lasting inhibition of norepinephrine transporter function.	The present study examined the potential membrane retention of desipramine (DMI) following exposures of 293-hNET cells to DMI, and its effect on [3H]NE uptake. Incubation of cells with 500 nM DMI for 1 h or 1 day persistently inhibited the uptake of [3H]NE up to 7 days, despite daily repeated washing of cells with drug-free medium. Uptake inhibition was paralleled by persistent retention of DMI associated with cells, as determined by HPLC and by radiotracer experiments using [3H]DMI. [3H]DMI trapped in membranes was displaceable by the structurally unrelated NET inhibitor, nisoxetine, in a concentration-dependent manner, implying interaction of retained [3H]DMI with the NET. A similar cellular retention was observed following incubation of cells with nisoxetine. The results demonstrate that DMI and nisoxetine are persistently retained in cell membranes, at least partly in association with the NET. The retention and slow diffusion of DMI and nisoxetine from membranes may contribute to their pharmacological and modulatory action on NET.
2891463	Comparison of ophthalmic beta-blocking agents.	Glaucoma is described, and the chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, and dosage and administration of betaxolol and levobunolol in comparison with timolol are reviewed. Betaxolol and levobunolol are two beta-adrenergic blocking agents being marketed as ophthalmic solutions for treatment of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and ocular hypertension (OHT). Betaxolol is a relatively cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocker, while levobunolol is a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocking agent. Double-blind comparative trials have suggested that betaxolol has an equal to slightly lower efficacy and levobunolol has equal efficacy in reducing intraocular pressure (IOP) compared with timolol, the first ophthalmic beta blocker. A mean reduction in intraocular pressure of 15-35% occurs with both betaxolol and levobunolol and is reported to be maintained with prolonged use. Betaxolol is associated with a higher (25%) incidence of local ocular adverse reactions than timolol. However, betaxolol produces less systemic beta 2- and possibly beta 1-adrenergic receptor blockade than either timolol or levobunolol. Betaxolol may be relatively safer to use in patients with reactive airway disease than either timolol or levobunolol. Levobunolol causes a similar to greater incidence of local ocular adverse reactions and similar systemic beta blockade compared with timolol. Levobunolol may possibly be longer acting than timolol, allowing more patients to be controlled by once-daily dosing. Betaxolol and levobunolol appear to be similar to timolol in controlling IOP in patients with POAG and OHT; additional experience with these agents is needed to assess the advantages and disadvantages of each agent.
23411246	Iron and zinc bioavailability in Caco-2 cells: influence of caseinophosphopeptides.	A study has been made of the influence of two pools of caseinophosphopeptides (CPPs) obtained from α(s)- and β-casein (CN) fractions, and of three specific CPPs (β-CN(1-25)4P, α(s1)-CN(64-74)4P and α(s2)-CN(1-19)4P), on iron bioavailability (ferritin synthesis) and zinc bioavailability (retention, transport and uptake of zinc) in Caco-2 cells. α-CPP and β-CPP pools did not improve ferritin synthesis, but the three specific CPPs showed an increase in ferritin synthesis in Caco-2 cells versus iron sulphate, β-CN(1-25)4P being the most effective. In relation to zinc bioavailability, α-CPPs, β-CPPs, α(s1)-CN(64-74)4P and β-CN(1-25)4P increased zinc uptake. However, this increase was of the same order as the increase due to the presence of zinc sulphate.
22992330	Genetic correlate of cognitive training response in schizophrenia.	Intensive computerized auditory training results in improved cognition for schizophrenia patients, but participants show variation in their cognitive gains and the biological factors that affect the response to training are unknown. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene have been related to cognitive function. Here we asked if functional variation in this gene has an impact on the response of schizophrenia patients to cognitive training. We genotyped 48 schizophrenia patients who completed 50 h of computerized cognitive training and analyzed the association between DNA variants in the COMT gene and the improvement in global cognition. Although conventional analyses did not reveal any significant associations, a set-based analysis examining the aggregate effect of common variation in the COMT gene (42 SNPs) suggested association with improvement in global cognition. Eight SNPs, mostly located in the 3' end of the COMT gene, were nominally associated with improvement in cognition. These data suggest that genotype influences the response to intensive cognitive training in schizophrenia, and may indicate that cognitive training regimens need to be personalized to the underlying biosignatures of each individual patient. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Cognitive Enhancers'.
16642288	Deletion of SLC19A2, the high affinity thiamine transporter, causes selective inner hair cell loss and an auditory neuropathy phenotype.	Mutations in the gene coding for the high-affinity thiamine transporter Slc19a2 underlie the clinical syndrome known as thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia (TRMA) characterized by anemia, diabetes, and sensorineural hearing loss. To create a mouse model of this disease, a mutant line was created with targeted disruption of the gene. Cochlear function is normal in these mutants when maintained on a high-thiamine diet. When challenged with a low-thiamine diet, Slc19a2-null mice showed 40-60 dB threshold elevations by auditory brainstem response (ABR), but only 10-20 dB elevation by otoacoustic emission (OAE) measures. Wild-type mice retain normal hearing on either diet. Cochlear histological analysis showed a pattern uncommon for sensorineural hearing loss: selective loss of inner hair cells after 1-2 weeks on low thiamine and significantly greater inner than outer hair cell loss after longer low-thiamine challenges. Such a pattern is consistent with the observed discrepancy between ABR and OAE threshold shifts. The possible role of thiamine transport in other reported cases of selective inner hair cell loss is considered.
17194211	Biosynthesis of selenocysteine on its tRNA in eukaryotes.	Selenocysteine (Sec) is cotranslationally inserted into protein in response to UGA codons and is the 21st amino acid in the genetic code. However, the means by which Sec is synthesized in eukaryotes is not known. Herein, comparative genomics and experimental analyses revealed that the mammalian Sec synthase (SecS) is the previously identified pyridoxal phosphate-containing protein known as the soluble liver antigen. SecS required selenophosphate and O-phosphoseryl-tRNA([Ser]Sec) as substrates to generate selenocysteyl-tRNA([Ser]Sec). Moreover, it was found that Sec was synthesized on the tRNA scaffold from selenide, ATP, and serine using tRNA([Ser]Sec), seryl-tRNA synthetase, O-phosphoseryl-tRNA([Ser]Sec) kinase, selenophosphate synthetase, and SecS. By identifying the pathway of Sec biosynthesis in mammals, this study not only functionally characterized SecS but also assigned the function of the O-phosphoseryl-tRNA([Ser]Sec) kinase. In addition, we found that selenophosphate synthetase 2 could synthesize monoselenophosphate in vitro but selenophosphate synthetase 1 could not. Conservation of the overall pathway of Sec biosynthesis suggests that this pathway is also active in other eukaryotes and archaea that synthesize selenoproteins.
12113820	Novel human metabolites of the angiotensin-II antagonist tasosartan and their pharmacological effects.	Three novel metabolites of the angiotensin-II (A-II) receptor antagonist tasosartan have been identified in humans, and the syntheses and pharmacologic profiling of these metabolites are reported. Each metabolite bound the human A-II receptor with IC(50)s between 20 and 45nM. The in vivo effects of these compounds in attenuating the pressor response to angiotensin-II challenge in anesthetized rats were also investigated. An unsaturated diol metabolite exhibited in vivo efficacy at intravenous doses of 1 and 3mg/kg, while the other metabolites, both carboxylic acids, had no significant effect at the same doses.
23239639	Synthesis of maleimide-functionalyzed HPMA-copolymers and in vitro characterization of the aRAGE- and human immunoglobulin (huIgG)-polymer conjugates.	Herein the synthesis of antibody-polymer conjugates, with a quite narrow dispersity based on the polymer HPMA, are reported. These conjugates are synthesized by coupling antibodies to maleimide-functionalized poly(N-(2-hydroxypropyl)-methacrylamide) (poly-HPMA) copolymers derived through reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization of pentafluorophenyl methacrylate via the intermediate step of an activated ester polymer. We develop a protocol that allows the attachment of two different model antibodies, monoclonal anti-RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end-products) antibody, and polyclonal human immunoglobulin (huIgG). Modification of the antibody and conjugation is monitored by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Preserved affinity is demonstrated by Western Blott and cell-uptake analysis, for example, to cells of the immune system.
23430161	Reduced Acute Recovery from Alcohol Impairment in Adults with ADHD.	RATIONALE: Prior research has found that adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) show increased sensitivity to the impairing effects of alcohol (Weafer et al., Exp Clin Psychopharmacol 17: 113-121, 2009). However, these studies have focused exclusively on the ascending limb of the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) curve, and it is unclear whether these adults continue to show increased sensitivity during the later phase of the dose as BAC is declining. OBJECTIVE: This study tested the hypothesis that those with ADHD would display increased response to alcohol during the ascending limb of the BAC curve and less recovery from the impairing effects during the descending limb. METHODS: Adult social drinkers with ADHD and control adults completed measures of motor coordination, reaction time (RT), and subjective intoxication twice following 0.64 g/kg alcohol and placebo. The measures were administered during the ascending limb of the BAC curve and again during the descending limb. RESULTS: During the ascending limb, alcohol reduced motor coordination, slowed RT, and increased self-reports of subjective intoxication. Those with ADHD displayed greater impairment of motor coordination compared with controls. During the descending limb, controls reported diminished subjective intoxication and showed recovery from the impairing effects of alcohol on both their motor coordination and their RT. Those with ADHD showed reduced subjective intoxication and faster RT during this time, but they did not recover motor control. CONCLUSIONS: The protracted time course of motor impairment in adults with ADHD despite reductions in subjective intoxication may contribute to poor decision making and diminished behavioral control in this group.
19888514	Binding between heparin and the integrin VLA-4.	Heparin possesses antimetastatic effects that were related to various molecular mechanisms beyond anticoagulant activities. The ability of heparin to interfere with the function of adhesion receptors in the metastatic course appears as a promising therapeutic approach. This refers to numerous findings that heparin attenuates metastasis in a selectin-dependent manner. We recently demonstrated that heparin interferes with the integrin VLA-4 on murine melanoma cells binding to VCAM-1. To confirm this activity and to obtain further insight into molecular recognition of heparin by VLA-4, we investigated the inhibition of VLA-4 mediated binding of human melanoma MV3 cells to immobilised VCAM-1 by different heparins. The size of heparin has an important impact on inhibition. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) and tinzaparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) representing a mean of about 18-20 monomers, displayed high inhibitory activity. Fractionating tinzaparin to 14-18 monomers reduced inhibition slightly, while the pentasaccharide fondaparinux was without effects. To confirm molecular recognition of tinzaparin by VLA-4, a surface acoustic wave-biosensor was applied. A VLA-4 containing membrane preparation of MV3 cells was immobilised at the sensors to allow for detection of kinetic binding constants of tinzaparin compared to VCAM-1. Tinzaparin binds to VLA-4 with affinity in the low micromolar range (4.61 x 10(-6) M), which clearly indicates specific molecular recognition. Furthermore, tinzaparin displays a nearly identical k(off) compared to VCAM-1 (5.13 x 10(-3) s(-1) versus 3.44 x 10(-3) s(-1)) which is evident for interference with the ligand binding. The data provide evidence for a direct confirmation of heparin binding to VLA-4 and thus, contribute to understand the antimetastatic activity of heparin.
23369343	Evaluation of in vivo anti-hyperglycemic and antioxidant potentials of α-santalol and sandalwood oil.	Sandalwood finds numerous mentions across diverse traditional medicinal systems in use worldwide. The objective of this study was to evaluate the in vivo anti-hyperglycemic and antioxidant potential of sandalwood oil and its major constituent α-santalol. The in vivo anti-hyperglycemic experiment was conducted in alloxan-induced diabetic male Swiss albino mice models. The in vivo antioxidant experiment was performed in d-galactose mediated oxidative stress induced male Swiss albino mice models. Intraperitoneal administration of α-santalol (100mg/kg BW) and sandalwood oil (1g/kg BW) for an week modulated parameters such as body weight, blood glucose, serum bilirubin, liver glycogen, and lipid peroxides contents to normoglycemic levels in the alloxan-induced diabetic mice. Similarly, intraperitoneal administration of α-santalol (100mg/kg BW) and sandalwood oil (1g/kg BW) for two weeks modulated parameters such as serum aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, superoxide dismutase, catalase, free sulfhydryl, protein carbonyl, nitric oxide, liver lipid peroxide contents, and antioxidant capacity in d-galactose mediated oxidative stress induced mice. Besides, it was observed that the beneficial effects of α-santalol were well complimented, differentially by other constituents present in sandalwood oil, thus indicating synergism in biological activity of this traditionally used bioresource.
17263187	Activation of type-2 chloride channels: a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of chronic constipation.	Chronic constipation affects up to 27% of the population and negatively impacts health-related quality-of-life. Prescription medications targeting chronic constipation currently include polyethylene glycol, lactulose and tegaserod, a serotonin type 4 receptor partial agonist. The most recent addition is lubiprostone (Amitiza), a type-2 chloride channel (ClC-2) activator which is a member of a new class of compounds known as prostones. Lubiprostone is a bicyclic fatty acid that acts locally on ClC-2 channels located in the apical membrane of intestinal epithelial cells. This stimulation of chloride secretion induces the passive movement of sodium and water into the intestinal lumen, yielding a net increase in isotonic fluid, which results in improved bowel function. In double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, lubiprostone increased the number of spontaneous bowel movements compared with placebo and was generally well tolerated. The predominant adverse effects were nausea and diarrhea. Lubiprostone represents a new therapeutic class of compounds for the treatment of chronic constipation and will be the focus of this review.
23547776	Development of an ALK2-Biased BMP Type I Receptor Kinase Inhibitor.	The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway has essential functions in development, homeostasis, and the normal and pathophysiologic remodeling of tissues. Small molecule inhibitors of the BMP receptor kinase family have been useful for probing physiologic functions of BMP signaling in vitro and in vivo and may have roles in the treatment of BMP-mediated diseases. Here we describe the development of a selective and potent inhibitor of the BMP type I receptor kinases, LDN-212854, which in contrast to previously described BMP receptor kinase inhibitors exhibits nearly 4 orders of selectivity for BMP versus the closely related TGF-β and Activin type I receptors. In vitro, LDN-212854 exhibits some selectivity for ALK2 in preference to other BMP type I receptors, ALK1 and ALK3, which may permit the interrogation of ALK2-mediated signaling, transcriptional activity, and function. LDN-212854 potently inhibits heterotopic ossification in an inducible transgenic mutant ALK2 mouse model of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. These findings represent a significant step toward developing selective inhibitors targeting individual members of the highly homologous BMP type I receptor family. Such inhibitors would provide greater resolution as probes of physiologic function and improved selectivity against therapeutic targets.
15219414	Oxandrolone blocks glucocorticoid signaling in an androgen receptor-dependent manner.	The anabolic steroid oxandrolone is increasingly used to preserve or restore muscle mass in those with HIV infection or serious burns. These effects are mediated, in part, by the androgen receptor (AR). Anti-glucocorticoid effects have also been reported for some anabolic steroids, and the goal of our studies was to determine whether oxandrolone had a similar mechanism of action. Studies with in vitro translated glucocorticoid receptor (GR), however, showed no inhibition of cortisol binding by oxandrolone. Conversely, experiments in cell culture systems demonstrated significant antagonism of cortisol-induced transcriptional activation by oxandrolone in cells expressing both the AR and GR. Inhibition was not overcome by increased cortisol concentration, and no inhibition by oxandrolone was observed in cells expressing GR alone, confirming that non-competitive mechanisms were involved. AR-dependent repression of transcriptional activation by oxandrolone was also observed with the synthetic glucocorticoids dexamethasone and methylprednisolone. Furthermore, the AR antagonists 2-hydroxyflutamide and DDE also repressed GR transactivation in an AR-dependent manner. A mutant AR lacking a functional nuclear localization signal (AR(4RKM)) was active in oxandrolone-mediated repression of GR even though oxandrolone-bound AR(4RKM) failed to enter the nucleus and did not affect nuclear import of GR. These data indicate a novel action of oxandrolone to suppress glucocorticoid action via crosstalk between AR and GR.
23317159	JAK inhibitors: pharmacology and clinical activity in chronic myeloprolipherative neoplasms.	The Janus family kinases (JAKs), JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2, are involved in cell growth, survival, development, and differentiation of a variety of cells, particularly immune cells and hematopoietic cells. They form a subgroup of the non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases. Activating mutations within each of the JAKs is associated with malignant transformations; the most common are mutations of JAK2 in polycythemia vera (PV) and other myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Identification of the V617F mutation of the JAK2 gene (JAK2 V617F) led to an important breakthrough in the understanding of MPN disease pathogenesis. The JAK2 V617F mutation is present in the majority of PV patients, and about 50% of patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) are affected. This mutation leads to hyperactivation of JAK2, cytokine-independent signaling, and subsequent activation of downstream signaling networks. JAK2 ATP-competitive inhibitors that indirectly inhibit the JAK-STAT pathway are new candidates for the treatment of MPN. JAK2 inhibitors in development for the treatment of MPN have demonstrated clinical activity with minimal toxicity. These agents consistently alleviate constitutional symptoms and reduce spleen size in PMF and other MPN. However, some of these inhibitors have additional unique effects. Ruxolitinib causes a significant reduction in the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Another inhibitor, CYT387, improves anemia. Many other JAK2 inhibitors such as TG101348 or SAR302503, SB1518, CEP701 and LY2784544 are now under investigation for MPN development. In contrast tasocitinib, a predominantly JAK3 inhibitor, is being evaluated in a number of inflammatory and immunological diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, ulcerative colitis, dry eye disease and in kidney transplant patients. In conclusion the use of JAK inhibitors in MPN and some of the immune-mediated disorders is a promising new strategy for therapy. However, definitive data from ongoing and future preclinical and clinical trials will aid in better defining the status of these drugs in the treatment of these diseases.
16563096	Tailor-made chemotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer patients.	The selection of the most effective chemotherapy treatment based on evaluation of biomarkers, that is, 'tailor-made chemotherapy', can improve the clinical outcome of non-small cell lung cancer patients, including early-stage tumors with a high metastatic potential and advanced-stage tumors with a low proliferation rate. Therefore, treatment would be chosen according to which drugs would be most effective in combating specific tumors. For example: 5-fluorouracil-derived agents would be used for tumors with a low expression of thymidylate synthase; gefitinib and erlotinib for tumors with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations or increased EGFR gene copy numbers; cisplatin and carboplatin for tumors with a low expression of excision repair cross complementing-1; and gemcitabine for tumors with a low expression of ribonucleotide reductase. The remaining populations of non-small cell lung cancers require chemotherapy using other drugs based on an evaluation of other targeted molecules.
16814387	Epratuzumab, a CD22-targeting recombinant humanized antibody with a different mode of action from rituximab.	Epratuzumab is a humanized anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody currently in clinical trials for treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and certain autoimmune diseases. Here we report the results of investigations of epratuzumab's mode of action in comparison to and in combination with the anti-CD20 mAb, rituximab. In vitro cell growth inhibition, induction of apoptosis, and the ability of the mAbs to mediate complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) were evaluated. We also investigated the potential activity of epratuzumab in the regulation of B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) activation. Epratuzumab and rituximab displayed very distinct modes of action; epratuzumab acts as an immunomodulatory agent, while rituximab is an acutely cytotoxic therapeutic antibody. Epratuzumab has distinct effects on cell growth from rituximab. For example, rituximab+anti-human IgG Fcgamma yielded marked inhibition of proliferation in human NHL cell lines, while epratuzumab had little or no effect in this assay. However, when cells were immobilized and stimulated with anti-IgM, epratuzumab, but not rituximab, caused a significant antiproliferative effect. Unlike rituximab, no CDC could be detected, and ADCC was modest but significant with epratuzumab. Importantly, combining rituximab and epratuzumab did not decrease rituximab's ability to induce apoptosis, CDC, and ADCC. In fact, the combination is more effective than rituximab alone in inhibiting proliferation of Daudi Burkitt lymphoma cells in the presence of second antibody, and at least equally effective to rituximab in the absence of crosslinking. These observations suggest that it may be possible to enhance clinical efficacy by combination therapy comprised of anti-CD20 and anti-CD22 mAbs.
23602984	Cannabinoids increase type 1 cannabinoid receptor expression in a cell culture model of striatal neurons: Implications for Huntington's disease.	The type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1) is a G protein-coupled receptor that is expressed at high levels in the striatum. Activation of CB1 increases expression of neuronal trophic factors and inhibits neurotransmitter release from GABA-ergic striatal neurons. CB1 mRNA levels can be elevated by treatment with cannabinoids in non-neuronal cells. We wanted to determine whether cannabinoid treatment could induce CB1 expression in a cell culture model of striatal neurons and, if possible, determine the molecular mechanism by which this occurred. We found that treatment of STHdh(7/7) cells with the cannabinoids ACEA, mAEA, and AEA produced a CB1 receptor-dependent increase in CB1 promoter activity, mRNA, and protein expression. This response was Akt- and NF-κB-dependent. Because decreased CB1 expression is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease (HD), we wanted to determine whether cannabinoids could increase CB1 expression in STHdh(7/111) and (111/111) cells expressing the mutant huntingtin protein. We observed that cannabinoid treatment increased CB1 mRNA levels approximately 10-fold in STHdh(7/111) and (111/111) cells, compared to vehicle treatment. Importantly, cannabinoid treatment improved ATP production, increased the expression of the trophic factor BDNF-2, and the mitochondrial regulator PGC1α, and reduced spontaneous GABA release, in HD cells. Therefore, cannabinoid-mediated increases in CB1 levels could reduce the severity of some molecular pathologies observed in HD.
23614400	Topological Dangling Bonds with Large Spin Splitting and Enhanced Spin Polarization on the Surfaces of Bi2Se3.	"We investigate the topological surface state properties at various surface cleaves in the topological insulator Bi2Se3, via first principles calculations and scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS). While the typical surface termination occurs between two quintuple layers, we report the existence of a surface termination within a single quintuple layer where dangling bonds form with giant spin splitting owing to strong spin-orbit coupling. Unlike Rashba split states in a 2D electron gas, these states are constrained by the band topology of the host insulator with topological properties similar to the typical topological surface state, and thereby offer an alternative candidate for spintronics usage. We name these new states ""topological dangling-bond states"". The degree of the spin polarization of these states is greatly enhanced. Since dangling bonds are more chemically reactive, the observed topological dangling-bond states provide a new avenue for manipulating band dispersions and spin-textures by adsorbed atoms or molecules."
23210662	Dendronized albumin core-shell transporters with high drug loading capacity.	We describe the synthesis of a core-shell biohybrid consisting of a human serum albumin (HSA) core that serves as a reservoir for lipophilic molecules and a cationized shell region consisting of ethynyl-G2.0-PAMAM or ethynyl-G3.0-PAMAM dendrons. The binding capacity of lipophilic guests was quantified applying electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, and five to six out of seven pockets were still available compared with HSA. The attachment of ethynyl-G2.0-PAMAM dendrons to HSA yielded a nontoxic core-shell macromolecule that was clearly uptaken by A549 human epithelial cells due to the presence of the dendritic PAMAM shell. Significantly higher loading of doxorubicin was observed for dendronized G2-DHSA compared with the native protein due to the availability of binding pockets of the HSA core, and interaction with the dendritic shell. Dendronized G2-DHSA-doxorubicin displayed significant cytotoxicity resulting from high drug loading and high stability under different conditions, thus demonstrating its great potential as a transporter for drug molecules.
23570914	Suppression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 via extracellular signal-regulated kinase contributes to bleomycin-induced oxidative stress and fibrogenesis.	Pulmonary fibrosis is a serious and irreversible lung injury with obscure etiologic mechanisms and no effective treatment to date. This study explored a crucial link between oxidative stress and pulmonary fibrogenesis, focusing on nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a core transcription factor in antioxidative regulation systems. Treatment of C57 BL/6 mice with bleomycin increased fibroblast viability and collagen production and significantly downregulated Nrf2. In addition, prominent oxidative stress was indicated by changes in superoxide dismutase, catalase activity, and glutathione and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance levels. In a cell-based model, bleomycin suppressed Nrf2 activation via extracellular signal-related kinase phosphorylation, enhancing intracellular reactive oxygen species in lung fibroblasts and stimulating abnormal cell proliferation and collagen secretion. To confirm this novel mechanism of bleomycin-induced fibrogenesis, we attempted to upregulate Nrf2 and related antioxidant proteins in bleomycin-treated fibroblasts using a putative Nrf2 activator, caffeic acid phenethyl ester, and the results showed that bleomycin-induced fibroblast proliferation and collagen content were attenuated through improved redox balance. Collectively, these results disclose a potential regulatory mechanism in pulmonary fibrosis that will aid the development of new therapies.
16763553	Regulation of retinal dehydrogenases and retinoic acid synthesis by cholesterol metabolites.	Retinoic acid (RA) constitutes the major active ingredient of vitamin A and is required for various biological processes. The tissue RA level is maintained through a cascade of metabolic reactions where retinal dehydrogenases (RALDHs) catalyze the terminal reaction of RA biosynthesis from retinal, a rate-limiting step. We showed that dietary supplement of cholesterol enhanced the expression of RALDH1 and 2 genes and the cellular RA content in vital organs such as brain, kidney, liver and heart. Consistently, the cholesterol-lowering agent (pravastatin sodium) downregulated the expression of RALDH1 and 2 genes in several organs especially the liver and in cultured liver cells. Further, cholesterol metabolites, predominantly the oxysterols, the natural ligands for liver X receptor (LXR), induced these genes via upregulation of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) that bound to the regulatory regions of these genes. Knockdown of LXRalpha/beta or SREBP-1c downregulated the expression of RALDH genes, which could be rescued by re-expressing SREBP-1c, suggesting SREBP-1c as a direct positive regulator for these genes. This study uncovered a novel crosstalk between cholesterol and RA biosynthesis.
23419872	Modulation of mitochondrial glutathione status and cellular energetics in primary cultures of proximal tubular cells from remnant kidney of uninephrectomized rats.	Compensatory renal hypertrophy following reduction in renal mass leads to a hypermetabolic state and increases in basal mitochondrial oxidative stress and susceptibility to several nephrotoxicants. Previous studies provide conflicting data on whether renal mitochondria after reduction in renal mass undergo proliferation or hypertrophy or both. In the present study, our goal was to determine whether mitochondria of hypertrophied kidney undergo hypertrophy or proliferation after uninephrectomy using the uninephrectomized (NPX) rat model. Renal proximal tubular (PT) cells from NPX rats exhibited increased mitochondrial density, membrane potential and protein but no significant difference in mitochondrial DNA, as compared to PT cells from control rats. Our previous studies showed that overexpression of two mitochondrial anion transporters, the dicarboxylate (DIC, Slc25a10) and oxoglutarate (OGC, Slc25a11) carriers, in NRK-52E cells resulted in increased mitochondrial uptake of glutathione (GSH) and protection from chemically induced apoptosis. In the present study, we overexpressed DIC- and OGC-cDNA plasmids to assess their function in renal PT cells after compensatory renal hypertrophy. PT cells from NPX rats that were first preincubated with GSH were protected from cytotoxicity due to the mitochondrial inhibitor antimycin A by overexpression of either of the two mitochondrial GSH transporters. Our present results provide further evidence that compensatory renal hypertrophy is associated primarily with mitochondrial hypertrophy and hyperpolarization and that manipulation of mitochondrial GSH transporters in PT cells of hypertrophied kidney can alter susceptibility to chemically induced injury under appropriate conditions and may be a suitable therapeutic approach.
23505344	A computational study of water and CO migration sites and channels inside myoglobin.	Pathways are computed for transport of H2O and CO in myoglobin (Mb), using the single sweep and zero-temperature string methods in a fully atomistic, explicitly solvated model system. Our predictions of sites and barriers in the pathways for CO transport agree with previous studies. For H2O, we predict a binding site in the distal pocket (DP), in agreement with crystallographic observations, and another one close to Leu 29 which explains the importance of this residue in controlling the pocket's hydrophobicity, as well as disordered minima in the largely apolar xenon cavities. In particular, H2O can occupy and transition among the xenon cavities, Xe4, Xe2, and Xe3. Our results support the hypothesis that the thermodynamically most favorable entry/exit portal for H2O is the so-called histidine gate (HG), the same as for CO. This result, along with the observation of water occupation of both DP and apolar Xe cavities, suggest that water and small gas molecules like CO compete for access to the protein interior, and therefore models of gas molecule transport within proteins should also explicitly consider water transport.
9627096	Distinct functional characteristics of levocabastine sensitive rat neurotensin NT2 receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells.	Neurotensin has been shown to produce pharmacological effects both in brain and periphery. Several of these effects are mediated by a high-affinity neurotensin NT1 receptor. On the other hand, a low-affinity levocabastine-sensitive neurotensin NT2 receptor was molecularly cloned from rodent brain recently. In this study, in contrast to NT1 receptor, levocabastine (a histamine H1 receptor antagonist) and SR48692 (an antagonist for NT1 receptor) strongly stimulated intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing rat NT2 receptor, thus acting as potent NT2 receptor. Furthermore, despite of their affinities for NT2 receptor, the Ca2+ responses to potent NT1 agonists, neurotensin or JMV449 ([Lys8-(CH2NH)-Lys9]Pro-Tyr-Ile-Leu, a peptidase resistant analogue of neurotensin) were much smaller than that observed with SR48692. These findings suggest that NT1 and NT2 receptors present distinct functional characteristics and that SR48692 may act as a potent agonist for NT2 receptor.
23300287	Lower Adiponectin Levels at First Trimester of Pregnancy Are Associated With Increased Insulin Resistance and Higher Risk of Developing Gestational Diabetes Mellitus.	OBJECTIVETo evaluate the associations between adiponectin levels and 1) the risk of developing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and 2) insulin resistance/sensitivity, β-cell function, and compensation indices in a prospective cohort representative of the general population of pregnant women.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSWe performed anthropometric measurements and collected blood samples at 1st (6-13 weeks) and 2nd (24-28 weeks) trimesters. Diagnosis of GDM was made at 2nd trimester, based on a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group criteria). Insulin was measured (ELISA; Luminex) to estimate homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), β-cell function (HOMA-B), insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index), insulin secretion (AUC(insulin/glucose)), and β-cell compensation (insulin secretion sensitivity index-2). Adiponectin was measured by radioimmunoassay.RESULTSAmong the 445 participants included in this study, 38 women developed GDM. Women who developed GDM had lower 1st-trimester adiponectin levels (9.67 ± 3.84 vs. 11.92 ± 4.59 µg/mL in women with normal glucose tolerance). Lower adiponectin levels were associated with higher risk of developing GDM (OR, 1.12 per 1 µg/mL decrease of adiponectin levels; P = 0.02, adjusted for BMI and HbA(1c) at 1st trimester). Adiponectin levels at 1st and 2nd trimesters were associated with HOMA-IR (both: r = -0.22, P < 0.0001) and Matsuda index (r = 0.28, P < 0.0001, and r = 0.29, P < 0.0001). After adjustment for confounding factors, we found no significant association with HOMA-B and AUC(insulin/glucose).CONCLUSIONSPregnant women with lower adiponectin levels at 1st trimester have higher levels of insulin resistance and are more likely to develop GDM independently of adiposity or glycemic measurements.
23307557	p300-mediated acetylation of TRF2 is required for maintaining functional telomeres.	The human telomeric protein TRF2 is required to protect chromosome ends by facilitating their organization into the protective capping structure. Post-translational modifications of TRF2 such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, SUMOylation, methylation and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation have been shown to play important roles in telomere function. Here we show that TRF2 specifically interacts with the histone acetyltransferase p300, and that p300 acetylates the lysine residue at position 293 of TRF2. We also report that p300-mediated acetylation stabilizes the TRF2 protein by inhibiting its ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis and is required for efficient telomere binding of TRF2. Furthermore, overexpression of the acetylation-deficient mutant, K293R, induces DNA-damage response foci at telomeres, thereby leading to induction of impaired cell growth, cellular senescence and altered cell cycle distribution. A small but significant number of metaphase chromosomes show no telomeric signals at chromatid ends, suggesting an aberrant telomere structure. These findings demonstrate that acetylation of TRF2 by p300 plays a crucial role in the maintenance of functional telomeres as well as in the regulation of the telomere-associated DNA-damage response, thus providing a new route for modulating telomere protection function.
23375260	Structural basis for autoinhibition of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor FARP2.	FARP2 is a Dbl-family guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that contains a 4.1, ezrin, radixin and moesin (FERM) domain, a Dbl-homology (DH) domain and two pleckstrin homology (PH) domains. FARP2 activates Rac1 or Cdc42 in response to upstream signals, thereby regulating processes such as neuronal axon guidance and bone homeostasis. How the GEF activity of FARP2 is regulated remained poorly understood. We have determined the crystal structures of the catalytic DH domain and the DH-PH-PH domains of FARP2. The structures reveal an auto-inhibited conformation in which the GEF substrate-binding site is blocked collectively by the last helix in the DH domain and the two PH domains. This conformation is stabilized by multiple interactions among the domains and two well-structured inter-domain linkers. Our cell-based activity assays confirm the suppression of the FARP2 GEF activity by these auto-inhibitory elements.
11808879	Heterogeneity of persistent hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia. A series of 175 cases.	UNLABELLED: Hyperinsulinism is a heterogeneous disorder characterised by severe hypoglycaemia due to an inappropriate oversecretion of insulin. In a personal series of 175 patients investigated for hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia over the last 20 years, we review clinical presentations, molecular studies and therapeutic management of hyperinsulinism. There were 98 neonatal-onset patients, including 86 permanent hyperinsulinism and 12 transient forms, 68 with infancy-onset and nine with childhood-onset. Hyperammonaemia was found in 12 out of 69 patients tested, 4 neonates and 8 infants. Neonates were clinically more severely affected than infants. Diagnosis of infancy-onset hyperinsulinism was often delayed because of less profound hypoglycaemia and better tolerance to hypoglycaemia. Neonates required higher rates of i.v. glucose than infants to maintain normal plasma glucose levels (16 mg/kg per min versus 12 mg/kg per min). Only 16% of neonates were diazoxide-sensitive compared to 66% of the infants. Neonates with hyperammonaemia or transient hyperinsulinism were diazoxide-sensitive. Most neonates were pancreatectomised whereas 65% of the infants were treated medically. Among surgically-treated patients, 47% had a focal adenomatous hyperplasia (31 neonates and 13 infants) and 53% a diffuse form of hyperinsulinism (39 neonates and 11 infants). Diazoxide-responsiveness in the focal and diffuse forms did not differ in both neonates and infants; it depended only upon the age of onset of hypoglycaemia. One or two mutations, SUR1 or KIR6.2, were found in 41 of 73 neonates who were investigated and in 13/38 infants using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism analysis of both genes. Almost all patients with SUR1 (38/41) or KIR6.2 (5/7) mutations were resistant to diazoxide. Ten patients with hyperinsulinism-hyperammonaemia syndrome had a mutation in the glutamate dehydrogenase gene (three neonates and seven infants) after reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis of cDNA. No mutation was found by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism in the glucokinase gene. Eight of nine patients with childhood onset hyperinsulinism were treated surgically and histological examination confirmed an adenoma in each case. CONCLUSION: the clinical severity of hyperinsulinism varies mainly with age at onset of hypoglycaemia. The heterogeneity of hyperinsulinism has major consequences in terms of therapeutic outcome and genetic counselling.
14676196	Structure of human microsomal cytochrome P450 2C8. Evidence for a peripheral fatty acid binding site.	A 2.7-Angstrom molecular structure of human microsomal cytochrome P450 2C8 (CYP2C8) was determined by x-ray crystallography. The membrane protein was modified for crystallization by replacement of the hydrophobic N-terminal transmembrane domain with a short hydrophilic sequence before residue 28. The structure of the native sequence is complete from residue 28 to the beginning of a C-terminal histidine tag used for purification. CYP2C8 is one of the principal hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes that oxidizes therapeutic drugs such as taxol and cerivastatin and endobiotics such as retinoic acid and arachidonic acid. Consistent with the relatively large size of its preferred substrates, the active site volume is twice that observed for the structure of CYP2C5. The extended active site cavity is bounded by the beta1 sheet and helix F' that have not previously been implicated in substrate recognition by mammalian P450s. CYP2C8 crystallized as a symmetric dimer formed by the interaction of helices F, F', G', and G. Two molecules of palmitic acid are bound in the dimer interface. The dimer is observed in solution, and mass spectrometry confirmed the association of palmitic acid with the enzyme. This novel finding identifies a peripheral binding site in P450s that may contribute to drug-drug interactions in P450 metabolism.
23017392	Optimization of frozen sour cherries vacuum drying process.	The objective of this research was to optimize the vacuum-drying of frozen sour cherries in order to preserve health-beneficial phytochemicals, as well as textural characteristics. Investigated range of temperature was 46-74°C and, of pressure, 17-583mbar, in a new design of vacuum-dryer equipment. The total solids, a(w) value, total phenolics, vitamin C, antioxidant activity, anthocyanin content, total colour change and firmness were used as quality indicators of dried sour cherry. Within the experimental range of studied variables, the optimum conditions of 54.03°C and 148.16mbar were established for vacuum drying of sour cherry. Separate validation experiments were conducted, under optimum conditions, to verify predictions and adequacy of the second-order polynomial models. Under these optimal conditions, the predicted amount of total phenolics was 744mg CAE/100 dw, vitamin C 1.44mg/100g per dry weight (g dw), anthocyanin content 125mg/100g dw, IC(50) 3.23mg/ml, total solids 70.72%, a(w) value 0.646, total colour change 52.61 and firmness 3395.4g. The investigated parameters had a significant effect on the quality of the dried sour cherries.
23160529	HLA-A*24 is an independent predictor of 5-year progression to diabetes in autoantibody-positive first-degree relatives of type 1 diabetic patients.	We investigated whether HLA-A*24 typing complements screening for HLA-DQ and for antibodies (Abs) against insulin, GAD, IA-2 (IA-2A), and zinc transporter-8 (ZnT8A) for prediction of rapid progression to type 1 diabetes (T1D). Persistently Ab(+) siblings/offspring (n = 288; aged 0-39 years) of T1D patients were genotyped for HLA-DQA1-DQB1 and HLA-A*24 and monitored for development of diabetes within 5 years of first Ab(+). HLA-A*24 (P = 0.009), HLA-DQ2/DQ8 (P = 0.001), and positivity for IA-2A ± ZnT8A (P < 0.001) were associated with development of T1D in multivariate analysis. The 5-year risk increased with the number of the above three markers present (n = 0: 6%; n = 1: 18%; n = 2: 46%; n = 3: 100%). Positivity for one or more markers identified a subgroup of 171 (59%) containing 88% of rapid progressors. The combined presence of HLA-A*24 and IA-2A(+) ± ZnT8A(+) defined a subgroup of 18 (6%) with an 82% diabetes risk. Among IA-2A(+) ± ZnT8A(+) relatives, identification of HLA-A*24 carriers in addition to HLA-DQ2/DQ8 carriers increased screening sensitivity for relatives at high Ab- and HLA-inferred risk (64% progression; P = 0.002). In conclusion, HLA-A*24 independently predicts rapid progression to T1D in Ab(+) relatives and complements IA-2A, ZnT8A, and HLA-DQ2/DQ8 for identifying participants in immunointervention trials.
11511858	Complexities of androgen action.	Androgens mediate a wide range of processes during embryogenesis and in the adult. In mammals, the principal androgens are testosterone and its 5alpha-reduced metabolite, 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Although these androgenic hormones are diverse in character, it is believed that their effects are mediated via the protein products of a single androgen receptor gene encoded on the X-chromosome. A great deal of information has now accumulated pertaining to the mechanisms by which nuclear receptors, such as the androgen receptor, modulate the activity of responsive genes. The studies have demonstrated the participation of a number of ancillary proteins in modulating activation or repression by nuclear receptors. In addition to studies focused on the mechanisms of nuclear receptor function, additional work has illuminated the mechanism by which androgens are metabolized in selected tissues. This information provides a perspective on the number of levels of complexity by which differential gene regulation by androgens may occur in different tissues and in different cell types.
23361587	Anti-aging molecule, Sirt1: a novel therapeutic target for diabetic nephropathy.	Caloric restriction prolongs the lifespan of many species. Therefore, investigators have researched the usefulness of caloric restriction for healthy lifespan extension. Sirt1, an NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase, was identified as a molecule necessary for caloric restriction-related anti-aging strategies. Sirt1 functions as an intracellular energy sensor to detect the concentration of NAD(+), and controls in vivo metabolic changes under caloric restriction and starvation through its deacetylase activity to many targets including histones, nuclear transcriptional factors, and enzymes. During the past decade, investigators have reported the relationship between disturbance of Sirt1 activation and the onset of aging- and obesity-associated diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative disorders. Consequently, a calorie restriction-mimetic action of Sirt1 is now expected as a new therapy for these diseases. In addition, recent studies have gradually clarified the role of Sirt1 in the onset of kidney disease. Its activation may also become a new target of treatment in the patients with chronic kidney disease including diabetic nephropathy. In this article, we would like to review the role of Sirt1 in the onset of kidney disease based on previous studies, and discuss its possibility as the target of treatment in diabetic nephropathy.
10933891	Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) activators, bezafibrate and Wy-14,643, increase uncoupling protein-3 mRNA levels without modifying the mitochondrial membrane potential in primary culture of rat preadipocytes.	Uncoupling proteins (UCPs) are inner mitochondrial membrane transporters which act as pores for H(+) ions, dissipating the electrochemical gradient that develops during mitochondrial respiration at the expense of ATP synthesis. We have studied the effects of two fibrates, bezafibrate and Wy-14,643, on UCP-3 and UCP-2 mRNA levels in primary monolayer cultures of rat adipocytes and undifferentiated preadipocytes. Treatment with both PPARalpha activators for 24 h up-regulated UCP-3 mRNA levels. Thus, bezafibrate treatment resulted in an 8-fold induction in UCP-3 mRNA levels in preadipocytes compared with the 3.5-fold induction observed in adipocytes. Differences in the induction of UCP-3 between these cells correlated well with the higher expression of PPARalpha and RXRalpha mRNA values in preadipocytes compared to adipocytes. Wy-14,643 caused similar effects on UCP-3 mRNA expression. In contrast to UCP-3, UCP-2 mRNA levels were only slightly modified by bezafibrate in adipocytes. The induction in UCP-3 expression was not accompanied by changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential of rat primary preadipocytes after bezafibrate or Wy-14,643 treatment. Since it has been proposed that UCP-3 could be involved in the regulation of the use of fatty acids as fuel substrates, the UCP-3 induction achieved after bezafibrate and Wy-14, 643 treatment may indicate a higher oxidation of fatty acids, limiting their availability to be stored as triglycerides. This change may result in a reduced rate of conversion of preadipocytes to adipocytes, which directly affects fat depots.
23422569	SIRT1 inhibits NADPH oxidase activation and protects endothelial function in the rat aorta: Implications for vascular aging.	Vascular aging is characterized by up-regulation of NADPH oxidase, oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. Previous studies demonstrate that the activity of the evolutionarily conserved NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase SIRT1 declines with age and that pharmacological activators of SIRT1 confer significant anti-aging cardiovascular effects. To determine whether dysregulation of SIRT1 promotes NADPH oxidase-dependent production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and impairs endothelial function we assessed the effects of three structurally different inhibitors of SIRT1 (nicotinamide, sirtinol, EX527) in aorta segments isolated from young Wistar rats. Inhibition of SIRT1 induced endothelial dysfunction, as shown by the significantly reduced relaxation to the endothelium-dependent vasodilators acetylcholine and the calcium ionophore A23187. Endothelial dysfunction induced by SIRT1 inhibition was prevented by treatment of the vessels with the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin or superoxide dismutase. Inhibition of SIRT1 significantly increased vascular superoxide production, enhanced NADPH oxidase activity, and mRNA expression of its subunits p22(phox) and NOX4, which were prevented by resveratrol. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) activation mimicked the effects of resveratrol while PPARα inhibition prevented the effects of this SIRT1 activator. SIRT1 co-precipitated with PPARα and nicotinamide increased the acetylation of the PPARα coactivator PGC-1α, which was suppressed by resveratrol. In conclusion, impaired activity of SIRT1 induces endothelial dysfunction and up-regulates NADPH oxidase-derived ROS production in the vascular wall, mimicking the vascular aging phenotype. Moreover, a new mechanism for controlling endothelial function after SIRT1 activation involves a decreased PGC-1α acetylation and the subsequent PPARα activation, resulting in both decreased NADPH oxidase-driven ROS production and NO inactivation.
12188035	Species-specific differences in the glucocorticoid receptor transactivation function upon binding with betamethasone-esters.	Glucocorticoids (GCs) are the most effective drugs for anti-inflammatory diseases. A number of adverse side effects, however, limit chronic treatment with GCs. To improve their therapeutic usefulness, attempts have been made to dissociate the two main actions of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), transactivation and transrepression, which are believed to be responsible for the side effects and anti-inflammatory effects, respectively. We report here species-specific differences in the transactivation response mediated by GR. Dexamethasone (DEX), betamethasone (BM), and their esterified-derivatives had full transrepression agonistic activity in a reporter assay using CV-1 cells transfected with either human or rat GR. These GCs also had full transactivation agonistic activity in CV-1 cells transfected with human GR. The esterified-BM, however, had only partial transactivation agonistic activity in cells transfected with rat GR, whereas BM and esterified-DEX had full transactivation agonistic activity. Moreover, in rat hepatoma H4-II-E cells, the esterified-BM failed to induce tyrosine aminotransferase, which is regulated by GR-mediated transactivation activity. There were no significant differences between the binding affinity of these GCs to human and rat GR. Consistent with the weak transactivation activity of esterified-BM mediated by rat GR, there were few side effects, evaluated by thymus involution and body weight loss, in an antigen-induced asthmatic model in rats. These results suggest that the potency of esterified-BM to induce transactivation activity is different between species and that this difference is not due to differences in receptor binding.
23567314	Evaluation of perfluoroalkyl acid activity using primary mouse and human hepatocytes.	While perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) have been studied at length, less is known about the biological activity of other perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) detected in the environment. Using a transient transfection assay developed in COS-1 cells, our group has previously evaluated a variety of PFAAs for activity associated with activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα). Here we use primary heptatocytes to further assess the biological activity of a similar group of PFAAs using custom designed Taqman Low Density Arrays. Primary mouse and human hepatoyctes were cultured for 48h in the presence of varying concentrations of 12 different PFAAs or Wy14,643, a known activator of PPARα. Total RNA was collected and the expression of 48 mouse or human genes evaluated. Gene selection was based on either in-house liver microarray data (mouse) or published data using primary hepatocytes (human). Gene expression in primary mouse hepatocytes was more restricted than expected. Genes typically regulated in whole tissue by PPARα agonists were not altered in mouse cells including Acox1, Me1, Acaa1a, Hmgcs1, and Slc27a1. Cyp2b10, a gene regulated by the constitutive androstane receptor and a transcript normally up-regulated by in vivo exposure to PFAAs, was also unchanged in cultured mouse hepatocytes. Cyp4a14, Ehhadh, Pdk4, Cpt1b, and Fabp1 were regulated as expected in mouse cells. A larger group of genes were differentially expressed in human primary hepatocytes, however, little consistency was observed across compounds with respect to which genes produced a significant dose response making the determination of relative biological activity difficult. This likely reflects weaker activation of PPARα in human versus rodent cells as well as variation among individual cell donors. Unlike mouse cells, CYP2B6 was up-regulated in human hepatocytes by a number of PFAAs as was PPARδ. Rankings were conducted on the limited dataset. In mouse hepatocytes, the pattern was similar to that previously observed in the COS-1 reporter cell assay. With the exception of PFHxA, longer chain PFAA carboxylates were the most active. The pattern was similar in human hepatocytes, although PFDA and PFOS showed higher activity than previously observed while PFOA showed somewhat less activity. These data reflect inherent challenges in using primary hepatocytes to predict toxicological response.
11118042	Sulindac sulfone inhibits K-ras-dependent cyclooxygenase-2 expression in human colon cancer cells.	Both the sulfide and sulfone metabolites of sulindac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, display anticarcinogenic effects in experimental models. Sulindac sulfide inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme activities and has been reported to suppress ras-dependent signaling. However, the mechanisms by which sulindac sulfone suppresses cancer growth are not as defined. We studied the effects of these sulindac metabolites in human colon cancer-derived Caco-2 cells that have been transfected with an activated K-ras oncogene. Stable transfected clones expressed high levels of COX-2 mRNA and protein, compared with parental cells. K-ras-transfected cells formed tumors more quickly when injected into severe combined immunodeficiency disease mice than parental cells, and this tumorigenesis was suppressed by treatment with sulindac. Sulindac sulfone inhibited COX-2 protein expression, which resulted in a decrease in prostaglandin synthase E2 production. Sulindac sulfide had little effect on COX-2 in this model, but did suppress prostaglandin synthase E2 production, presumably by inhibiting COX enzyme activity. These data indicate that the sulfide and sulfone derivatives of sulindac exert COX-dependent effects by distinct mechanisms.
23632081	Identification of an Allosteric Modulator of Serotonin Transporter with Novel Mechanism of Action.	"Serotonin transporters (SERT) play an essential role in the termination and regulation of serotonin signaling in the brain. SERT is also the target of antidepressants and psychostimulants. Molecules with novel activities and modes of interaction with regard to SERT function are of great scientific and clinical interest. We explored structural regions outside the putative serotonin translocation pathway to identify potential binding sites for allosteric transporter modulators (ATMs). Mutational studies revealed a pocket of amino acids outside the orthosteric substrate binding sites located in the interface between extracellular loops 1 and 3 that when mutated affect transporter function. Using the structure of the bacterial transporter homologue leucine transporter as a template, we developed a structural model of SERT. We performed molecular dynamics simulations to further characterize the allosteric pocket that was identified by site-directed mutagenesis studies and employed this pocket in a virtual screen for small-molecule modulators of SERT function. In functional transport assays, we found that one of the identified molecules, ATM7, increased the reuptake of serotonin, possibly by facilitating the interaction of serotonin with transport-ready conformations of SERT when concentrations of serotonin were low and rate limiting. In addition, ATM7 potentiates 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA, ""Ecstasy"")-induced reversed transport by SERT. Taking advantage of a conformationally sensitive residue in transmembrane domain 6, we demonstrate that ATM7 mechanistically stabilizes an outward-facing conformation of SERT. Taken together these observations demonstrate that ATM7 acts through a novel mechanism that involves allosteric modulation of SERT function."
23240691	FINDSITE(comb): a threading/structure-based, proteomic-scale virtual ligand screening approach.	Virtual ligand screening is an integral part of the modern drug discovery process. Traditional ligand-based, virtual screening approaches are fast but require a set of structurally diverse ligands known to bind to the target. Traditional structure-based approaches require high-resolution target protein structures and are computationally demanding. In contrast, the recently developed threading/structure-based FINDSITE-based approaches have the advantage that they are as fast as traditional ligand-based approaches and yet overcome the limitations of traditional ligand- or structure-based approaches. These new methods can use predicted low-resolution structures and infer the likelihood of a ligand binding to a target by utilizing ligand information excised from the target's remote or close homologous proteins and/or libraries of ligand binding databases. Here, we develop an improved version of FINDSITE, FINDSITE(filt), that filters out false positive ligands in threading identified templates by a better binding site detection procedure that includes information about the binding site amino acid similarity. We then combine FINDSITE(filt) with FINDSITE(X) that uses publicly available binding databases ChEMBL and DrugBank for virtual ligand screening. The combined approach, FINDSITE(comb), is compared to two traditional docking methods, AUTODOCK Vina and DOCK 6, on the DUD benchmark set. It is shown to be significantly better in terms of enrichment factor, dependence on target structure quality, and speed. FINDSITE(comb) is then tested for virtual ligand screening on a large set of 3576 generic targets from the DrugBank database as well as a set of 168 Human GPCRs. Excluding close homologues, FINDSITE(comb) gives an average enrichment factor of 52.1 for generic targets and 22.3 for GPCRs within the top 1% of the screened compound library. Around 65% of the targets have better than random enrichment factors. The performance is insensitive to target structure quality, as long as it has a TM-score ≥ 0.4 to native. Thus, FINDSITE(comb) makes the screening of millions of compounds across entire proteomes feasible. The FINDSITE(comb) web service is freely available for academic users at http://cssb.biology.gatech.edu/skolnick/webservice/FINDSITE-COMB/index.html.
23234537	Hybrid carbon nanotube networks as efficient hole extraction layers for organic photovoltaics.	Transparent, highly percolated networks of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (rr-P3HT)-wrapped semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (s-SWNTs) are deposited, and the charge transfer processes of these nanohybrids are studied using spectroscopic and electrical measurements. The data disclose hole doping of s-SWNTs by the polymer, challenging the prevalent electron-doping hypothesis. Through controlled fabrication, high- to low-density nanohybrid networks are achieved, with low-density hybrid carbon nanotube networks tested as hole transport layers (HTLs) for bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaics (OPV). OPVs incorporating these rr-P3HT/s-SWNT networks as the HTL demonstrate the best large area (70 mm(2)) carbon nanotube incorporated organic solar cells to date with a power conversion efficiency of 7.6%. This signifies the strong capability of nanohybrids as an efficient hole extraction layer, and we believe that dense nanohybrid networks have the potential to replace expensive and material scarce inorganic transparent electrodes in large area electronics toward the realization of low-cost flexible electronics.
23305444	Discovery and evaluation of novel inhibitors of mycobacterium protein tyrosine phosphatase B from the 6-Hydroxy-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid scaffold.	Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) protein tyrosine phosphatase B (mPTPB) is a virulence factor secreted by the pathogen and mediates mycobacterial survival in macrophages by targeting host cell immune responses. Consequently, mPTPB represents an exciting new target to combat tuberculosis (TB) infection. We describe a medicinal chemistry oriented approach that transforms a benzofuran salicylic acid scaffold into a highly potent (IC(50) = 38 nM) and selective mPTPB inhibitor (>50 fold against a large panel of PTPs). Importantly, the inhibitor is capable of reversing the altered host immune responses induced by the bacterial phosphatase and restoring the macrophage's full capacity to secrete IL-6 and undergo apoptosis in response to interferon-γ stimulation, validating the concept that chemical inhibition of mPTPB may be therapeutically useful for novel TB treatment. The study further demonstrates that bicyclic salicylic acid pharmacophores can be used to deliver PTP inhibitors with high potency, selectivity, and cellular efficacy.
11959556	Effects of amino acid alterations in penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) 1a, 2b, and 2x on PBP affinities of penicillin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, cefditoren, cefuroxime, cefprozil, and cefaclor in 18 clinical isolates of penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate, and -resistant pneumococci.	Amino acid alterations in or flanking conserved motifs making up the active binding sites of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) 1a, 2b, and 2x of pneumococci were correlated with changes in affinities of penicillin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, cefditoren, cefuroxime, cefprozil, and cefaclor for these PBPs. Four penicillin-susceptible (PSSP), eight penicillin-intermediate (PISP), and six penicillin-resistant (PRSP) pneumococci were studied by DNA sequencing of the penicillin-binding sites of the pbp1a, -2x, and -2b genes of strains and by determining 50% inhibitory concentrations of the seven agents for PBP1a, -2x, and -2b. Two PSSP strains had alterations in PBP2x (L(546)-->V) (one strain) or PBP2b (T(445)-->A) (one strain). All eight PISP strains had at least two alterations--T(338)-->P or A or H(394)-->Y in PBP2X and T(445)-->A in BPB2b. All PRSP strains had the same changes seen in PISP strains, as well as T(371)-->A or S substitutions in PBP1a. The two most resistant PRSP strains had a second change in PBP2x (M(339)-->F) in a conserved motif. The affinities of penicillin and ampicillin for all three PBPs were decreased for PRSP and most PISP strains. The affinity of amoxicillin for PBP1a and -2x was decreased only for PRSP. Cefaclor and cefprozil showed decreased affinity of PRSP but not PISP for all three PBPs. Cefuroxime showed decreased affinity of PISP and PRSP for PBP1a and -2x but no change for PBP2b. Cefditoren showed no difference in PBP affinity based on penicillin or cefditoren MICs, indicating a different PBP target for this agent. Overall, the MICs for and PBP affinities of the strains correlated with the changes found in the PBP active binding sites.
23168241	Merit of quinacrine in the decrease of ingested sulfite-induced toxic action in rat brain.	We aimed at investigating the effects of sulfite-induced lipid peroxidation and apoptosis mediated by secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) on somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) alterations in rats. Thirty male albino Wistar rats were randomized into three experimental groups as follows; control (C), sodium metabisulfite treated (S), sodium metabisulfite+quinacrine treated (SQ). Sodium metabisulfite (100 mg/kg/day) was given by gastric gavage for 5 weeks and 10 mg/kg/day quinacrine was applied as a single dose of intraperitoneal injection for the same period. The latencies of SEP components were significantly prolonged in the S group and returned to control levels following quinacrine administration. Plasma-S-sulfonate level was increased in S and SQ groups. TBARS levels in the S group were significantly higher than those detected in controls. Quinacrine significantly decreased brain TBARS levels in the SQ group compared with the S group. Quinacrine treatment did not have an effect on the increased sPLA2 level of the sulfite administered group. Immunohistochemistry showed that sulfite caused an increase in caspase-3 and TUNEL positive cells, restored to control levels via quinacrine administration. This study showed that sPLA2 might play a role in ingested sulfite-induced SEP alterations, oxidative stress, apoptotic cell death and DNA damage in the brain.
23414802	Discovery of novel 2-hydroxydiarylamide derivatives as TMPRSS4 inhibitors.	TMPRSS4 is a novel type II transmembrane serine protease that has been implicated in the invasion and metastasis of colon cancer cells. In this study, a novel series of 2-hydroxydiarylamide derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for inhibiting TMPRSS4 serine protease activity and suppressing cancer cell invasion. These derivatives demonstrated good inhibitory activity against TMPRSS4 serine protease, which correlated with the promising anti-invasive activity of colon cancer cells overexpressing TMPRSS4.
14508322	Activation of alpha 2B-adrenoceptors mediates the cardiovascular effects of etomidate.	BACKGROUND: The intravenous anesthetic etomidate exhibits structural similarities to specific alpha2-adrenoceptor agonists of the type such as dexmedetomidine. The current study was performed to elucidate the possible interaction of etomidate with alpha2-adrenoceptors in mice lacking individual alpha2-adrenoceptor subtypes (alpha2-KO). METHODS: Sedative and cardiovascular responses to etomidate and the alpha2-agonist, dexmedetomidine, were determined in mice deficient in alpha2-receptor subtypes. Inhibition of binding of the alpha2-receptor antagonist [3H]RX821002 to recombinant alpha2-receptors by etomidate was tested in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells in vitro. RESULTS: In vivo, loss and recovery of the righting reflex required similar times after intraperitoneal injection of etomidate in wild-type and in alpha2A-receptor-deficient mice, indicating that the hypnotic effect of etomidate in mice does not require the alpha2A-receptor subtype. Intravenous injection of etomidate resulted in a transient increase (duration 2.4 +/- 0.2 min) in arterial blood pressure in wild-type mice (17 +/- 3 mmHg). Etomidate did not affect blood pressure in alpha2B-KO or alpha2AB-KO mice. In membranes from HEK293 cells transfected with alpha2-receptors, etomidate inhibited binding of the alpha2-antagonist, [3H]RX821002, with higher potency from alpha2B- and alpha2C-receptors than from alpha2A-receptors (Ki alpha2A 208 microm, alpha2B 26 microm, alpha2C 56 microm). In alpha2B-receptor-expressing HEK293 cells, etomidate rapidly increased phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-related kinases ERK1/2. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that etomidate acts as an agonist at alpha2-adrenoceptors, which appears in vivo primarily as an alpha2B-receptor-mediated increase in blood pressure. This effect of etomidate may contribute to the cardiovascular stability of patients after induction of anesthesia with etomidate.
8522988	Cloning, characterization, and chromosomal localization of a human 5-HT6 serotonin receptor.	We describe the cloning and characterization of a human 5-HT6 serotonin receptor. The open reading frame is interrupted by two introns in positions corresponding to the third cytoplasmic loop and the third extracellular loop. The human 5-HT6 cDNA encodes a 440-amino-acid polypeptide whose sequence diverges significantly from that published for the rat 5-HT6 receptor. Resequencing of the rat cDNA revealed a sequencing error producing a frame shift within the open reading frame. The human 5-HT6 amino acid sequence is 89% similar to the corrected rat sequence. The recombinant human 5-HT6 receptor is positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase and has pharmacological properties similar to the rat receptor with high affinity for several typical and atypical antipsychotics, including clozapine. The receptor is expressed in several human brain regions, most prominently in the caudate nucleus. The gene for the receptor maps to the human chromosome region 1p35-p36. This localization overlaps that established for the serotonin 5-HT1D alpha receptor, suggesting that these may be closely linked. Comparison of genomic and cDNA clones for the human 5-HT6 receptor also reveals an Rsal restriction fragment length polymorphism within the coding region.
20223979	Identification of a primary target of thalidomide teratogenicity.	Half a century ago, thalidomide was widely prescribed to pregnant women as a sedative but was found to be teratogenic, causing multiple birth defects. Today, thalidomide is still used in the treatment of leprosy and multiple myeloma, although how it causes limb malformation and other developmental defects is unknown. Here, we identified cereblon (CRBN) as a thalidomide-binding protein. CRBN forms an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex with damaged DNA binding protein 1 (DDB1) and Cul4A that is important for limb outgrowth and expression of the fibroblast growth factor Fgf8 in zebrafish and chicks. Thalidomide initiates its teratogenic effects by binding to CRBN and inhibiting the associated ubiquitin ligase activity. This study reveals a basis for thalidomide teratogenicity and may contribute to the development of new thalidomide derivatives without teratogenic activity.
10913016	Hypertrophic effect of selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor stimulation on ventricular cardiomyocytes from adult rat.	We investigated whether selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor stimulation causes hypertrophic growth on isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes from adult rat. As parameters for the induction of hypertrophic growth, the increases of [(14)C]phenylalanine incorporation, protein and RNA mass, and cell size were determined. Isoproterenol (Iso, 10 microM) alone had no growth effect. In the presence of the beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI-118551 (ICI, 10 microM), Iso caused an increase in [(14)C]phenylalanine incorporation, protein and RNA mass, cell volume, and cross-sectional area. We showed for phenylalanine incorporation that the growth effect of Iso+ICI could be antagonized by beta(1)-adrenoceptor blockade with atenolol (10 microM) or metoprolol (10 microM), indicating that it was caused by selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor stimulation. The growth response to Iso+ICI was accompanied by an increase in ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity and expression. Inhibition of ODC by the ODC antagonist difluoromethylornithine (1 mM) attenuated this hypertrophic response, indicating that ODC induction is causally involved. The growth response to Iso+ICI was found to be cAMP independent but was sensitive to genistein (100 microM) or rapamycin (0.1 microM). The reaction was enhanced in the presence of pertussis toxin (10 microM). We conclude that selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor stimulation causes hypertrophic growth of ventricular cardiomyocytes by a mechanism that is independent of cAMP but dependent on a tyrosine kinase and ODC.
15661821	Impact of glucose infusion on the structural and functional characteristics of adipose tissue and on hypothalamic gene expression for appetite regulatory neuropeptides in the sheep fetus during late gestation.	In the present study, our aim was to determine whether intrafetal glucose infusion increases fetal adiposity, synthesis and secretion of leptin and regulates gene expression of the 'appetite regulatory' neuropeptides neuropepetide Y (NPY), agouti-related peptide (AGRP), pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) and receptors (leptin receptor (OB-Rb) and melancortin 3 receptor (MC3R)) within the fetal hypothalamus. Glucose (50% dextrose in saline) or saline was infused (7.5 ml h(-1)) into fetal sheep between 130 and 140 days gestation (term = 150 +/- 3 days gestation). Glucose infusion increased circulating glucose and insulin concentrations, mean lipid locule size (532.8 +/- 3.3 microm2 versus 456.7 +/- 14.8 microm2) and total unilocular fat mass (11.7 +/- 0.6 g versus 8.9 +/- 0.6 g) of the perirenal fat depot. The expression of OB-Rb mRNA was higher in the ventromedial nucleus compared to the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus in both glucose and saline infused fetuses (F= 8.04; P < 0.01) and there was a positive correlation between expression of OB-Rb and MC3R mRNA in the arcuate nucleus (r= 0.81; P < 0.005). Glucose infusion increased mRNA expression for POMC, but not for the anorectic neuropeptide CART, or the orexigenic neuropeptides NPY and AGRP, in the arcuate nucleus of the fetal hypothalamus. These findings demonstrate that increased circulating glucose and insulin regulate gene expression of the neuropeptides within the fetal hypothalamus that are part of the neural network regulating energy balance in adult life.
23602987	BDNF-induced local protein synthesis and synaptic plasticity.	Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is an important regulator of synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus and in other brain regions, playing a role in the formation of certain forms of memory. The effects of BDNF in LTP are mediated by TrkB (tropomyosin-related kinase B) receptors, which are known to be coupled to the activation of the Ras/ERK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ) pathways. The role of BDNF in LTP is best studied in the hippocampus, where the neurotrophin is thought to act at pre- and post-synaptic levels. Recent studies have shown that BDNF regulates the transport of mRNAs along dendrites and their translation at the synapse, by modulating the initiation and elongation phases of protein synthesis, and by acting on specific miRNAs. Furthermore, the effect of BDNF on transcription regulation may further contribute to long-term changes in the synaptic proteome. In this review we discuss the recent progress in understanding the mechanisms contributing to the short- and long-term regulation of the synaptic proteome by BDNF, and the role in synaptic plasticity, which is likely to influence learning and memory formation. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'BDNF'.
17035524	Functional analyses of glycyl-tRNA synthetase mutations suggest a key role for tRNA-charging enzymes in peripheral axons.	Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2D (CMT2D) and distal spinal muscular atrophy type V (dSMA-V) are axonal neuropathies characterized by a phenotype that is more severe in the upper extremities. We previously implicated mutations in the gene encoding glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GARS) as the cause of CMT2D and dSMA-V. GARS is a member of the family of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases responsible for charging tRNA with cognate amino acids; GARS ligates glycine to tRNA(Gly). Here, we present functional analyses of disease-associated GARS mutations and show that there are not any significant mutation-associated changes in GARS expression levels; that the majority of identified GARS mutations modeled in yeast severely impair viability; and that, in most cases, mutant GARS protein mislocalizes in neuronal cells. Indeed, four of the five mutations studied show loss-of-function features in at least one assay, suggesting that tRNA-charging deficits play a role in disease pathogenesis. Finally, we detected endogenous GARS-associated granules in the neurite projections of cultured neurons and in the peripheral nerve axons of normal human tissue. These data are particularly important in light of the recent identification of CMT-associated mutations in another tRNA synthetase gene [YARS (tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase gene)]. Together, these findings suggest that tRNA-charging enzymes play a key role in maintaining peripheral axons.
1687367	The alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking activities of labetalol and its RR-SR (50:50) stereoisomers.	1. We compared the alpha 1-, alpha 2- and beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking potencies of labetalol with those of its two stereoisomers (RR and SR) in pithed rats and in homogenized rat cerebral cortex and heart. 2. In pithed rats, labetalol and the RR-SR combination were given orally either at doses of 25 and 50 mg kg-1 body wt. or intravenously at doses of 1 and 5 mg kg-1 body wt. Prazosin 4 and 20 micrograms kg-1 body wt. and propranolol 1 and 5 mg kg-1 body wt., were given intravenously for comparison studies of potency at alpha 1- and beta 1-adrenoceptors, respectively. Effects were studied before and after i.v. administration of either phenylephrine (at doses which increased the mean arterial pressure by approximately 80 mmHg) or isoprenaline (at doses that increased heart rate by approximately 100 beats min-1). 3. In pithed rats, labetalol and the RR-SR combination antagonized, in a dose-dependent manner, the pressor effect of phenylephrine (P less than 0.05) and the chronotropic effect of isoprenaline (P less than 0.05). Following both oral and intravenous dosing, the RR-SR combination was twice potent as labetalol in terms of alpha 1- and beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonism at equivalent doses. 4. Labetalol and the enantiomers lacked affinity at alpha 2-adrenoceptors while at alpha 1-adrenoceptors the order of potency was prazosin much greater than RR-SR greater than labetalol. At beta 1-adrenoceptors, the affinity of the compound RR-SR was about 3 times that of labetalol.5. As labetalol is a mixture of active (RR and SR) and inactive (SS and SR) enantiomers (in terms of alpha and beta receptor actions), the combination of RR and SR may be a valuable substitute for labetalol in the treatment of systemic hypertension. Although the potential for non-specific side effects (common to all four enantiomers) could be expected to be diminished, recent reports by postmarketing surveillance indicate that the RR isomer (dilevalol) can induce liver toxicity. Interestingly, labetalol is devoid of this effect; whether the combination of RR and SR enantiomers could be of clinical importance warrants further investigation.
17513636	Ammonia has anesthetic properties.	BACKGROUND: A recent theory of anesthesia predicts that some endogenous compounds should have anesthetic properties. This theory raises the possibility that metabolites that are profoundly elevated in disease may also exert anesthetic effects. Because in pathophysiologic concentrations, ammonia reversibly impairs memory, consciousness, and responsiveness to noxious stimuli in a manner similar to anesthetics, we investigated whether ammonia had anesthetic properties. METHODS: The effect of ammonia was studied on alpha1beta2 and alpha1beta2gamma2s gamma-amino butyric acid type A, alpha1 glycine, and NR1/NR2A N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, and the two-pore domain potassium channel TRESK. Channels were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and studied using two-electrode voltage clamping. The immobilizing effect of ammonia in rats was evaluated by determining the reduction in isoflurane minimum alveolar concentration produced by IV infusion of ammonium chloride. The olive oil-water partition coefficient was measured to determine whether free ammonia (NH3) followed the Meyer-Overton relation. RESULTS: Ammonia positively modulated TRESK channels and glycine receptors. No effect was seen on alpha1beta2 and alpha1beta2gamma2s gamma-amino butyric acid type A receptors or NR1/NR2A N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors. Ammonia reversibly decreased the requirement for isoflurane, with a calculated immobilizing EC50 of 1.6 +/- 0.1 mM NH4Cl. The Ostwald olive oil-water partition coefficient for NH3 was 0.018. At a pH of 7.4, and at the anesthetic EC50, the NH3 concentration in bulk olive oil is 0.42 muM, approximately five orders of magnitude less than observed by anesthetics that follow the Meyer-Overton relation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the hypothesis that ammonia has anesthetic properties. Bulk oil concentration did not predict the potency of ammonia.
23282091	Treatment and prevention of various therapeutic conditions using OX receptor antagonistic activity (WO2012081692).	Application WO2012081692 from Taisho Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. claims pyrazole-based antagonists of the orexin-1 and orexin-2 receptors. Utility in a number of therapeutic areas is claimed, including the treatment of sleep disorders; the most likely use of the claimed compounds. Data from in vitro functional assays are presented, with the claimed compounds typically being dual orexin receptor antagonists (DORAs) or having moderate selectivity for orexin-1. Structurally, the claimed compounds represent a variation on established DORA SAR themes and translate features of clinical compounds into a pyrazole-based scaffold. Example 52, the most potent molecule in the application, has similar molecular weight and lipophilicity to suvorexant, the most advanced DORA, with broadly comparable potency in functional assays.
23619606	Exposure to DEHP decreased four fatty acid levels in plasma of prepartum mice.	Maternal exposure to di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) decreased the plasma triglyceride in prepartum mice. To identify the fatty acid (FA) species involved and to understand the underlying mechanisms, pregnant Sv/129 wild-type (mPPARα), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α-null (Pparα-null) and humanized PPARα (hPPARα) mice were treated with diets containing 0%, 0.01%, 0.05% or 0.1% DEHP. Dams were dissected on gestational day 18 together with fetuses, and on postnatal day 2 together with newborns. n-3/n-6 polyunsaturated, saturated, and monounsaturated FAs in maternal plasma and in liver of wild-type offspring, and representative enzymes for FA desaturation and elongation in maternal liver, were measured. The plasma levels of linoleic acid, α-linolenic acid, palmitic acid and oleic acid were higher in the pregnant control mPPARa mice than in Ppara-null and hPPARa mice. DEHP exposure significantly decreased the levels of these four FAs only in pregnant mPPARα mice. Plasma levels of many FAs were higher in pregnant mice than in postpartum ones in a genotype-independent manner, while it was lower in the livers of fetuses than pups. DEHP exposure slightly increased hepatic arachidonic acid, α-linolenic acid, palmitoleic acid and oleic acid in fetuses, but not in pups. However, DEHP exposure did not clearly influence FA desaturase 1 and 2 nor elongase 2 and 5 expressions in the liver of all maternal mice. Taken together, the levels of plasma four FAs with shorter carbon chains were higher in pregnant mPPARα mice than in other genotypes, and DEHP exposure decreased these specific FA concentrations only in mPPARα mice, similarly to triglyceride levels.
22659408	Glycine release is regulated by metabotropic glutamate receptors sensitive to mGluR2/3 ligands and activated by N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG).	The presence of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) of group II modulating glycine exocytosis from glycinergic nerve endings of mouse spinal cord was investigated. Purified synaptosomes were selectively prelabeled with [(3)H]glycine through the neuronal transporter GlyT2 and subsequently depolarized by superfusion with 12 mM KCl. The selective mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 inhibited the K(+)-evoked overflow of [(3)H]glycine in a concentration-dependent manner (EC(50) about 0.2 nM). The effect of LY379268 was prevented by the selective mGluR2/3 antagonist LY341495 (IC(50) about 1 nM). N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) inhibited [(3)H]glycine overflow with extraordinary potency (EC(50) about 50 fmol). In contrast, glutamate was ineffective up to 0.1 nM, excluding that glutamate contamination of commercial NAAG samples is responsible for the reported activity of NAAG at mGluR3. LY341495 antagonized the NAAG inhibition of [(3)H]glycine release. The effect of a combination of maximally effective concentrations of LY379268 and NAAG exhibited no additivity. The non-hydrolysable NAAG analogue N-acetylaspartyl-β-linked glutamate (β-NAAG) antagonized NAAG and LY379268. In conclusion, our results show that glycinergic nerve endings in spinal cord are endowed with group II mGluRs mediating inhibition of glycine exocytosis. NAAG can activate these presynaptic receptors with extremely high affinity and with characteristics compatible with the reported mGluR3 pharmacology. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors'.
16554743	Effect of antidepressant drugs in mice lacking the norepinephrine transporter.	One of the main theories concerning the mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs (ADs) is based on the notion that the neurochemical background of depression involves an impairment of central noradrenergic transmission with a concomitant decrease of the norepinephrine (NE) in the synaptic gap. Many ADs increase synaptic NE availability by inhibition of the reuptake of NE. Using mice lacking NE transporter (NET-/-) we examined their baseline phenotype as well as the response in the forced swim test (FST) and in the tail suspension test (TST) upon treatment with ADs that display different pharmacological profiles. In both tests, the NET-/- mice behaved like wild-type (WT) mice acutely treated with ADs. Autoradiographic studies showed decreased binding of the beta-adrenergic ligand [3H]CGP12177 in the cerebral cortex of NET-/- mice, indicating the changes at the level of beta-adrenergic receptors similar to those obtained with ADs treatment. The binding of [3H]prazosin to alpha1-adrenergic receptors in the cerebral cortex of NET-/- mice was also decreased, most probably as an adaptive response to the sustained elevation of extracellular NE levels observed in these mice. A pronounced NET knockout-induced shortening of the immobility time in the TST (by ca 50%) compared to WT mice was not reduced any further by NET-inhibiting ADs such as reboxetine, desipramine, and imipramine. Citalopram, which is devoid of affinity for the NET, exerted a significant reduction of immobility time in the NET-/- mice. In the FST, reboxetine, desipramine, imipramine, and citalopram administered acutely did not reduce any further the immobility time shortened by NET knockout itself (ca 25%); however, antidepressant-like action of repeatedly (7 days) administered desipramine was observed in NET-/- mice, indicating that the chronic presence of this drug may also affect other neurochemical targets involved in the behavioral reactions monitored by this test. From the present study, it may be concluded that mice lacking the NET may represent a good model of some aspects of depression-resistant behavior, paralleled with alterations in the expression of adrenergic receptors, which result as an adaptation to elevated levels of extracellular NE.
14720519	EGF receptor transactivation by urokinase receptor stimulus through a mechanism involving Src and matrix metalloproteinases.	Urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are ubiquitous receptors involved in the control of a variety of cellular processes frequently found altered in cancer cells. The EGFR has been recently described to play a transduction role of uPAR stimuli, mediating uPA-induced proliferation in highly malignant cells that overexpress uPAR. In the present work, we found for the first time that uPAR stimulation with the amino-terminal fragment (ATF) of urokinase devoid of proteolytic activity transactivates the EGFR in mammary MCF-7 cells through a mechanism involving Src and a metalloproteinase, as indicated by its sensitivity to selected inhibitors. In these cells, which express low levels of uPAR and malignancy, both ATF and EGF stimuli induced an interaction of the EGFR with uPAR and ERK activation. However, EGFR activation by uPAR stimuli mediated cellular invasion rather than proliferation, while EGFR activation by EGF led to a proliferative response. These results revealed a complex modulation of EGFR function toward different cellular responses according to the status of uPAR activity. On the other hand, we also found that MMP-mediated activation of EGFR can occur in an autocrine manner in cells which secrete uPA. All this reveals novel regulatory systems operating through autocrine loops involving uPAR stimuli, Src, MMP and EGFR activation which could mediate fine control of physiological processes as well as contribute to the expression of proliferative and invasive phenotypes of cancerous cells.
11215397	[Disruption of prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle as an animal model for schizophrenia].	Disruption of prepulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle in rats has been widely used as an animal model for the sensorimotor gating deficit state usually found in schizophrenia. PPI was reported to be regulated by forebrain circuits, including mesolimbic cortex, nucleus accumbens, ventral pallidum, thalamus, and pedunculopontine tegmentum nucleus. Phencyclidine or dopamine agonists, which causes psychotomimetic symptoms in humans, disrupts PPI in animals. The ED50 value of the drugs to reverse the phencyclidine-induced PPI disruption was significantly correlated with the affinity for the serotonin 2A receptor, but not for the dopamine D2 receptor of each drug (including atypical antipsychotics). In contrast, the ED50 value of the drugs to reverse the apomorphine-induced PPI disruption was significantly correlated with the affinity for the dopamine D2 receptor (including typical antipsychotics). Thus the drug that antagonizes the disruption of PPI caused by PCP or DA agonists would be a candidate for a therapeutic agent for the sensorimotor gating deficit state in schizophrenic patients. Neural mechanisms underlying the disruption of PPI were reviewed.
11509829	Effects of the serine/threonine kinase SGK1 on the epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC) and CFTR: implications for cystic fibrosis.	Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterized by impaired Cl(-) secretion and increased Na(+) reabsorption in several tissues including respiratory epithelium. Many CFTR mutations have been identified over the past years. However, only a poor correlation between the genotype and lung phenotype was found suggesting additional factors influencing the phenotype and course of the disease. The serine/threonine kinase SGK1 has recently been shown to stimulate the activity of the epithelial Na(+) channel ENaC. A variety of stimuli such as aldosterone, cell shrinkage, insulin or TGF-beta1 stimulate transcription and activate the SGK1 kinase. Here we further examined the effects of SGK1 on ENaC and CFTR which have mutual interactions and we analyzed sgk1 mRNA abundance in lung tissue from CF patients. Coexpression of CFTR and h-SGK1 in Xenopus oocytes increased ENaC currents as previously described. In addition CFTR mediated currents were also stimulated. h-SGK1 accelerated the expression of the amiloride sensitive Na(+)- current in Xenopus oocytes paralleled by increased ENaC-protein abundance in the oocyte membrane, an effect which was reversed by a h-SGK1(K127R) mutation lacking the ATP-binding site. The cation selectivity or Na(+) affinity were not affected. However, coexpression of h-SGK1 with ENaC altered the sensitivity of the Na(+)-channel to the inhibitors amiloride and triamterene. The inhibitory effect of CFTR expression on ENaC current was not affected by coexpression of h-SGK1 in Xenopus oocytes. Lung tissue from CF patients strongly expressed the serine/threonine kinase h-sgk1 which was not the case for non-CF lung tissue. Loss of CFTR function itself in a CF lung epithelial cell line did not increase SGK1 expression. In summary, enhanced expression of h-SGK1 in epithelial cells of CF-lung tissue may be a novel pathophysiological factor contributing to increased Na(+) channel activity and thus to increased Na(+) transport in CF.
23620485	Variability in P-Glycoprotein Inhibitory Potency (IC50) Using Various In Vitro Experimental Systems: Implications for Universal Digoxin DDI Risk Assessment Decision Criteria.	A P-glycoprotein (P-gp) IC50 working group was established with twenty-three participating pharmaceutical and contract research laboratories and one academic institution to assess inter-laboratory variability in P-gp IC50 determinations. Each lab followed their in-house protocol to determine in vitro IC50 values for sixteen inhibitors using four different test systems: Caco-2 (11 labs), MDCKII-MDR1 (6 labs) and LLC-PK1-MDR1 (4 labs) cells, and membrane vesicles containing human P-gp (5 labs). For cell models, various equations to calculate remaining transport activity (e.g. efflux ratio, unidirectional flux, net secretory flux) were also evaluated. The difference in IC50 values for each of the inhibitors across all test systems and equations ranged from a minimum of 20- and 24-fold between lowest and highest IC50 values for sertraline and isradipine, to a maximum of 407- and 796-fold for telmisartan and verapamil, respectively. For telmisartan and verapamil, variability was greatly influenced by data from one laboratory in each case. Excluding these two data sets brings the range in IC50 values for telmisartan and verapamil down to 69- and 159-fold. The efflux ratio based-equation generally resulted in several fold lower IC50 values compared to unidirectional or net-secretory flux equations. Statistical analysis indicated that variability in IC50 values was mainly due to inter-laboratory variability, rather than an implicit systematic difference between test systems. Potential reasons for variability are discussed and the simplest, most robust experimental design for P-gp IC50 determination proposed. The impact of these findings on drug-drug interaction risk assessment is discussed in the companion paper and recommendations are provided.
14767264	Alpha1-adrenergic receptors and their inhibitors in lower urinary tract symptoms and benign prostatic hyperplasia.	PURPOSE: We provide a comprehensive overview of the role of alpha1-adrenergic receptors (alpha1ARs) as critical mediators of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and pathophysiology in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and we review the pharmacological antagonists of alpha1ARs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A review was performed of pertinent studies in the literature relating to the pathophysiology of LUTS and BPH, focusing on the role of alpha1ARs, and of clinical trial and practice data evaluating the different agents that inhibit these receptors. RESULTS: Further characterization of the alpha1AR gene family indicates that 3 receptor subtypes exist in humans. Their different distribution between urinary tract and cardiovascular tissues has provided a strategy for the development of improved therapeutic agents. Since excessive activity of the alpha1aAR and alpha1dAR subtypes appears to be a common feature in symptomatic BPH and alpha1aARs are enriched in prostatic tissue, drugs that demonstrate high alpha1aAR selectivity have attracted attention. Tamsulosin, which has high affinity for alpha1aAR and alpha1dAR subtypes but not for alpha1bAR, shows efficacy similar to the nonsubtype selective agents terazosin and doxazosin. It is associated with fewer cardiovascular side effects, although it has some ejaculatory side effects. The nonsubtype selective agent alfuzosin also demonstrates efficacy and offers an enhanced side effect profile, particularly minimizing hypotension. Other agents with super selective specificity for the alpha1aAR subtype are under investigation. CONCLUSIONS: Further advances in the treatment of LUTS associated with BPH may depend not only on receptor subtype selectivity, but also on other pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors.
23563356	No mutations in the serotonin related TPH1 and HTR1B genes in patients with monogenic sclerosing bone disorders.	Since the identification of LRP5 as the causative gene for the osteoporosis pseudoglioma syndrome (OPPG) as well as the high bone mass (HBM) phenotype, LRP5 and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling have been extensively studied for their role in the differentiation and proliferation of osteoblasts, in the apoptosis of osteoblasts and osteocytes and in the response of bone to mechanical loading. However, more recently the direct effect of LRP5 on osteoblasts and bone formation has been questioned. Gene expression studies showed that mice lacking lrp5 have increased expression of tph1, the rate limiting enzyme for the production of serotonin in the gut. Furthermore mice lacking either tph1 or htr1B, the receptor for serotonin on the osteoblasts, were reported to have an increased bone mass due to increased bone formation. This led to the still controversial hypothesis that LRP5 influences bone formation indirectly by regulating the expression of thp1 and as a consequence influencing the production of serotonin in the gut. Based on these data we decided to evaluate the role of TPH1 and HTR1B in the development of craniotubular hyperostoses, a group of monogenic sclerosing bone dysplasias. We screened the coding regions of both genes in 53 patients lacking a mutation in the known causative genes LRP5, LRP4 and SOST. We could not find disease-causing coding variants in neither of the tested genes and therefore, we cannot provide support for an important function of TPH1 and HTR1B in the pathogenesis of sclerosing bone dysplasias in our tested patient cohort.
15646817	In vivo activity of the potent oxytocin antagonist on uterine activity in the rat.	Oxytocin antagonist (OTA), TT-235, was developed by our group and shown to inhibit either spontaneous or oxytocin-induced uterine contractions in primates. The purpose of the present study was to confirm the duration of TT-235 to block oxytocin-induced uterine contractions in estrous rats. In Experiment 1, the time-response of the three OTAs on uterine contractility was examined. The rats were anesthetized and cannulas were placed in the jugular vein for infusing vehicle (sterile saline), Antag I, Antag II and TT-235. The uterine activity was monitored through a water-filled balloon-tipped cannula placed in the uterine horn. The uterine contractile activity was determined as the integrated area for 10 minutes. Each OTA was administered as a single bolus injection of 5 microg, followed by 100 mU of oxytocin 5 minutes later, also done as a single bolus. Oxytocin injection of the same dosage was repeated every hour for 5 hours. Experiment 2 determined the effect of the three OTAs on uterine oxytocin receptor number (Rn) and binding affinity (Kd). Rats treated with either OTA or vehicle were sacrificed at 0.5 and 4 hours for receptor assay. In Experiment 1, Antag I, Antag II and TT-235 inhibited the integrated uterine response to oxytocin at 5 minutes by 76%, 77% and 80%, respectively, compared to controls (p<0.05). Two hours after injecting Antag I, inhibition of uterine contractility was 55% lower than controls (p<0.05). At 3 hours, uterine contractility was no longer affected in rats treated with Antag I compared with controls. The suppressive uterine activity with Antag II continued up to 3 hours. However, uterine contractility remained lower (53%) in rats treated with TT-235 5 hours later. In Experiment 2, TT-235 induced a significant decrease (p<0.05) in oxytocin receptor number and binding affinity at both 0.5 and 4 hours compared with controls. Antag I and Antag II did not alter oxytocin receptor number or binding affinity significantly at each time point studied compared with controls. In conclusion, TT-235 may inhibit the uterine response to oxytocin by decreasing oxytocin receptor numbers and oxytocin binding affinity, which might explain the prolonged oxytocin antagonist activity of TT-235.
15755648	Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of N-acetyl-2-carboxybenzenesulfonamides: a novel class of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors.	N-Acetyl-2-carboxybenzenesulfonamide (11), and a group of analogues possessing an appropriately substituted-phenyl substituent (4-F, 2,4-F(2), 4-SO(2)Me, 4-OCHMe(2)) attached to its C-4, or C-5 position, were synthesized for evaluation as selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors. In vitro COX-1/COX-2 inhibition studies showed that 11 is a more potent inhibitor (COX-1 IC(50)=0.06microM; COX-2 IC(50)=0.25microM) than aspirin (COX-1 IC(50)=0.35microM; COX-2 IC(50)=2.4microM), and like aspirin [COX-2 selectivity index (S.I.)=0.14], 11 is a nonselective COX-2 inhibitor (COX-2 S.I.=0.23). Regioisomers having a 2,4-difluorophenyl substituent attached to the C-4 (COX-2 IC(50)=0.087microM; COX-2 S.I. >1149), or C-5 (COX-2 IC(50)=0.77microM, SI>130), position of 11 exhibited the most potent and selective COX-2 inhibitory activity relative to the reference drug celecoxib (COX-1 IC(50)=33.1microM; COX-2 IC(50)=0.07microM; COX-2 S.I.=472). N-Acetyl-2-carboxybenzenesulfonamide (11, ED(50)=49 mg/kg), and its C-4 2,4-difluorophenyl derivative (ED(50)=91 mg/kg), exhibited superior antiinflammatory activity (oral dosing) in a carrageenan-induced rat paw edema assay compared to aspirin (ED(50)=129 mg/kg). These latter compounds exhibited comparable analgesic activity to the reference drug diflunisal, and superior analgesic activity compared to aspirin, in a 4% NaCl-induced abdominal constriction assay. A molecular modeling (docking) study indicated that the SO(2)NHCOCH(3) substituent present in N-acetyl-2-carboxy-4-(2,4-fluorophenyl)benzenesulfonamide, like the acetoxy substituent in aspirin, is suitably positioned to acetylate the Ser(530) hydroxyl group in the COX-2 primary binding site. The results of this study indicate that the SO(2)NHCOCH(3) pharmacophore present in N-acetyl-2-carboxybenzenesulfonamides is a suitable bioisostere for the acetoxy (OCOMe) group in aspirin.
1403790	The discriminative stimulus effects of clozapine in pigeons: involvement of 5-hydroxytryptamine1C and 5-hydroxytryptamine2 receptors.	Pigeons were trained to discriminate i.m. injections of the atypical antipsychotic clozapine (1.0 mg/kg) from saline in a two-key operant procedure. In substitution tests, compounds that shared antagonistic action at 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1C and 5-HT2 receptors produced discriminative stimulus effects similar to clozapine: cyproheptadine, metergoline, mianserin, pizotifen and fluperlapine. 5-HT antagonists selective for 5-HT2 vs. 5-HT1C receptors (e.g., ketanserin, pirenperone, risperidone and methiothepin) failed to produce substantial clozapine-appropriate responding. Other serotonergic compounds failed to produce substantial clozapine-appropriate responding: the 5-HT3 antagonist, ondansetron; the 5-HT1A agonists, (+-)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin and BMY 14802; the 5-HT1A/1B agonist, RU24969; the 5-HT1A partial agonist, NAN190; the 5-HT1C/2 antagonist, mesulergine; the 5-HT1 agonist, I-5-hydroxytryptophane; and the 5-HT1C/2 agonist, quipazine. Other reference compounds such as the typical antipsychotics, chlorpromazine and thioridazine; the selective dopamine D-2 antagonists, droperidol and sulpiride; the dopamine D-1 antagonist, SCH 23390; the antimuscarinics, atropine and scopolamine; the antihistamines, pyrilamine and diphenhydramine; the alpha-1 antagonist, prazosin; and the antidepressants, imipramine and chloromipramine also failed to produce clozapine-appropriate responding. Promethazine, cinanserin and amitriptyline produced only partial generalization to the clozapine cue. The results suggest that blockade of both 5-HT2 and/or 5-HT1C receptors is important in the pharmacological mediation of the discriminative stimulus effects of clozapine. Blockade of 5-HT2 receptors appears not to be sufficient to produce clozapine-like discriminative stimulus effects. The precise role of 5-HT1C receptors in the clozapine discriminative stimulus is unclear due to the lack of compounds selective for this receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
23578644	Conjugated linoleic acid and calcium co-supplementation improves bone health in ovariectomised mice.	Osteoporosis is a significant health concern for the elderly; conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) has been shown to improve overall bone mass when calcium is included as a co-supplement. However, potential effects of CLA and calcium on bone mass during a period of bone loss have not been reported. The purpose of this study was to determine how dietary calcium modulates the effects of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) in preventing bone loss, using an ovariectomised mouse model. CLA supplementation significantly prevented ovariectomy-associated weight and fat mass gain, compared to non-supplemented controls. CLA significantly increased bone markers without major changes in bone mineral composition in the femur compared to respective controls. CLA treatment increased serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) significantly (p=0.0172), while serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 concentration was not changed by CLA. Meanwhile, CLA significantly reduced femur tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity, suggesting potential reduction of osteoclastogenesis. The data suggest that CLA, along with dietary calcium, has great potential to be used to prevent bone loss and weight gain associated with menopause.
23470629	Measurement of Transport Activities of 3β-Hydroxy-Δ(5)-bile Acids in Bile Salt Export Pump and Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins Using LC-MS/MS.	A method has been developed for the measurement of transport activities in membrane vesicles obtained from Sf9 cells for 3β-hydroxy-Δ(5)-bile acids by high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Calibration curves for the bile acids were linear over the range of 10 to 2000 pmol/mL, and the detection limit was less than 1 pmol/mL for 3β-hydroxy-Δ(5)-bile acids using selected reaction monitoring analysis. The analytical method was applied to measurements of transport activities in membrane vesicles obtained from human multidrug resistance-associated protein 2-, 3-, and human bile salt export pump-expressing Sf9 cells for conjugated 3β-hydroxy-Δ(5)-bile acids. The present study demonstrated that human multidrug resistance-associated protein 3 vesicles accepted conjugated 3β-hydroxy-Δ(5)-bile acids along with common bile acids such as glycocholic acid and taurolithocholic acid 3-sulfate.
23434648	Structural Characterization of an LPA1 Second Extracellular Loop Mimetic with a Self-Assembling Coiled-Coil Folding Constraint.	G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) structures are of interest as a means to understand biological signal transduction and as tools for therapeutic discovery. The growing number of GPCR crystal structures demonstrates that the extracellular loops (EL) connecting the membrane-spanning helices show tremendous structural variability relative to the more structurally-conserved seven transmembrane α-helical domains. The EL of the LPA(1) receptor have not yet been conclusively resolved, and bear limited sequence identity to known structures. This study involved development of a peptide to characterize the intrinsic structure of the LPA(1) GPCR second EL. The loop was embedded between two helices that assemble into a coiled-coil, which served as a receptor-mimetic folding constraint (LPA(1)-CC-EL2 peptide). The ensemble of structures from multi-dimensional NMR experiments demonstrated that a robust coiled-coil formed without noticeable deformation due to the EL2 sequence. In contrast, the EL2 sequence showed well-defined structure only near its C-terminal residues. The NMR ensemble was combined with a computational model of the LPA(1) receptor that had previously been validated. The resulting hybrid models were evaluated using docking. Nine different hybrid models interacted with LPA 18:1 as expected, based on prior mutagenesis studies, and one was additionally consistent with antagonist affinity trends.
20624440	Rasagiline protects against alpha-synuclein induced sensitivity to oxidative stress in dopaminergic cells.	Rasagiline is a propargylamine and irreversible monoamine oxidase (MAO) B inhibitor used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). It has demonstrated neuroprotective properties in laboratory studies. Current concepts of PD aetiopathogenesis include the role of alpha-synuclein, protein aggregation, free radical metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction in contributing to cell death. We have used a combination of alpha-synuclein and free radical mediated toxicity in a dopaminergic cell line to provide a model of nigral toxicity in order to investigate the potential molecular mechanisms that mediate rasagiline protection. We demonstrate that rasagiline protects against cell death induced by the combination of free radicals generated by paraquat and either wild-type or A53T mutant alpha-synuclein over-expression. This protection was associated with a reduction in caspase 3 activation, a reduction in superoxide generation and a trend to ameliorate the fall in mitochondrial membrane potential. Rasagiline induced an increase in cellular glutathione levels. The results support a role for rasagiline in protecting dopaminergic cells against free radical mediated damage and apoptosis in the presence of alpha-synuclein over-expression. The data are of relevance to the interpretation of the potential mechanisms of action of rasagiline in explaining the results of disease modification trials in PD.
23514378	The role of platelet/lymphocyte serotonin transporter in depression and beyond.	A large amount of the data gathered in the last 50 years support the hypothesis that alterations of the serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of not only major depression (MD), but also of different neuropsychiatric disorders. Research in this field has been substantially promoted by the evidence that the reuptake protein (SERT), present in presynaptic neurons, is a key element in terminating the activity of the neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft. For this reason, it was specifically targeted for the development of second-generation antidepressants, in particular of selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), with the aim of increasing the intrasynaptic 5-HT concentrations. Moreover, since a lot of studies showed that circulating platelets and, more recently, lymphocytes possess functional SERT proteins, they have been widely used as peripheral mirrors of the same structures located in the central nervous system. The presence of functional SERT in blood cells suggests strict relationships between the nervous and the immune system that need to be better clarified in MD, as well as the possibility of reciprocal modulation of the two systems by different drugs. This paper aims to review briefly the literature on the 5-HT hypothesis of depression with a major focus on the possible role of SERT in this disorder, while highlighting how recent data are more oriented on dimensional rather than nosological involvement of this structure in different conditions spanning from normality to pathology.
9063462	Evolution of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase family and the organization of the Drosophila glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase gene. Intron/exon structure of the gene, control of expression of the two mRNAs, selective advantage of the multienzyme complex.	In Drosophila, glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase is a multifunctional synthetase encoded by a unique gene and composed of three domains: the amino- and carboxy-terminal domains catalyze the aminoacylation of glutamic acid and proline tRNA species, respectively, and the central domain is made of 75 amino acids repeated six times amongst which 46 are highly conserved and constitute the repeated motifs [Cerini, C., Kerjan, P., Astier, M., Gratecos, D., Mirande, M. & Semeriva, M. (1991) EMBO J. 10, 4267-4277]. The intron/exon organization of the Drosophila gene reveals the presence of six exons among which four are in the 5'-end encoding glutamic acid activity. Only one exon encodes the repeated motifs. A comparison of introns positions, intron classes and intron/exon boundaries in the Drosophila gene and in its human counterpart is compatible with the intron-early hypothesis presiding, at least in part, to the evolution of the synthetases. The full-length fly protein is encoded by a 6.1-kb mRNA which is expressed throughout development. In addition, a shorter transcript encompasses the 3'-end of the cDNA and it is especially abundant in 5-10-h embryos until the first larval stage. Expression of these two mRNAs seems to be controlled by two independent promoters. The 6.1-kb mRNA promoter is probably localized in the 5'-end of the gene. The small mRNA promoter resides in the 4th intron and evidence is provided that the mRNA encodes only the domain corresponding to prolyl-tRNA synthetase and is functional in vivo. Finally, transgenic flies have been established by using constructs corresponding to the three domains of the protein. Overexpression of the repeated motifs leads to a sterility of the flies that suggests a role of these motifs in linking the multienzyme complex to an, as yet, unknown structure of the protein synthesis apparatus.
23218716	Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase inhibitory activity of derivatives of marine alkaloid tsitsikammamine A.	Tsitsikammamines are marine alkaloids whose structure is based on the pyrroloiminoquinone scaffold. These and related compounds have attracted attention due to various interesting biological properties, including cytotoxicity, topoisomerase inhibition, antimicrobial, antifungal and antimalarial activity. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) is a well-established therapeutic target as an important factor in the tumor immune evasion mechanism. In this preliminary communication, we report the inhibitory activity of tsitsikammamine derivatives against IDO1. Tsitsikammamine A analogue 11b displays submicromolar potency in an enzymatic assay. A number of derivatives are also active in a cellular assay while showing little or no activity towards tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO), a functionally related enzyme. This IDO1 inhibitory activity is rationalized by molecular modeling studies. An interest is thus established in this class of compounds as a potential source of lead compounds for the development of new pharmaceutically useful IDO1 inhibitors.
23591044	Melatonin and ethanol intake exert opposite effects on circulating estradiol and progesterone and differentially regulate sex steroid receptors in the ovaries, oviducts, and uteri of adult rats.	Chronic ethanol intake is associated with sex hormone disturbances, and it is well known that melatonin plays a key role in regulating several reproductive processes. We report the effects of ethanol intake and melatonin treatment (at doses of 100μg/100gBW/day) on sex hormones and steroid receptors in the ovaries, oviducts and uteri of ethanol-preferring rats. After 150 days of treatment, animals were euthanized, and tissue samples were harvested to evaluate androgen, estrogen, progesterone and melatonin receptor subunits (AR, ER-α and ER-β, PRA, PRB and MT1R, respectively). Melatonin decreased estradiol (E2) and increased progesterone (P4) and 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (6-STM), while an ethanol-melatonin combination reduced both P4 and E2. Ovarian AR was not influenced by either treatment, and oviduct AR was reduced after ethanol-melatonin combination. Oviduct ER-α, ER-β and uterine ER-β were down-regulated by either ethanol or melatonin. Conversely, ovarian PRA and PRB were positively regulated by ethanol and ethanol-melatonin combination, whereas PRA was down-regulated in the uterus and oviduct after ethanol consumption. MT1R was increased in ovaries and uteri of melatonin-treated rats. Ethanol and melatonin exert opposite effects on E2 and P4, and they differentially regulate the expression of sex steroid receptors in female reproductive tissues.
23561118	Alternanthera paronychioides protects pancreatic β-cells from glucotoxicity by its antioxidant, antiapoptotic and insulin secretagogue actions.	The antioxidant and antiglucotoxic effects of Alternanthera paronychioides on pancreatic β-cell were investigated. Antioxidant assays demonstrated that ethanol extracts of A. paronychioides (EEAP) exhibited the highest antioxidant activity, which also had the highest phenolic and flavonoid contents. Two major polyphenolics, ferulic acid and quercetin, were identified from EEAP by HPLC-DAD. Effects of EEAP, ferulic acid and quercetin on high glucose (25mmol/L)-induced pancreatic β-cell apoptosis and dysfunction were further evaluated. Results showed that EEAP and quercetin but not ferulic acid protected β-cells from glucotoxicity through several mechanisms, including: (1) maintaining β-cell viability; (2) suppressing reactive oxygen species production; (3) reducing characteristic features of apoptosis; (4) inhibiting the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 and the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase; (5) upregulating pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 gene expression and the insulin secretagogue action of pancreatic β-cells. These findings may shed light on the preventive actions of A. paronychioides on diabetic glucotoxicity.
10682471	[Effect of mifepristone on the expression of progesterone receptor messenger RNA and protein in uterine leiomyomata].	OBJECTIVE: To determine the expression of progesterone receptor (PR) mRNA and PR protein levels in the myometrium and leiomyomata from untreated and mifepristone pretreated women with leiomyoma and to examine the mechanism of mifepristone treatment on uterine leiomyomata. METHODS: Expression of PR mRNA and PR protein were determined by Northern blot and HAP of single-dose saturated analysis in myometrium and leiomyomata (center and marginal area) from 27 untreated and 6 mifepristone pretreated women with leiomyomata. RESULTS: PR mRNA abundance and PR protein levels in both myomatous center and marginal area were significantly greater than those in corporal myometrium (P < 0.01) in both follicular and luteal phases, but similar between myomatous center and marginal area (P > 0.05). 6 cases pretreated with mifepristone 25 mg/day for 3 months were operated, all but one patient displayed a decrease in leiomyomata volume. PR mRNA abundance in both myometruim and leiomyomata (center and marginal area) was significantly decreased in 4 patients continuing mifepristone treatment before the operation but not in the other 2 patients stopping RU486 1 month before operation. PR protein levels in these tissues showed significant decrease in all 6 cases. CONCLUSION: There are overexpression of PRmRNA and PR protein in leiomyomata. One of the mechanism of mifepristone action on decreasing leiomyomata volume may be related to suppression on expression of PR gene. It seems that suppression on transcription of PR gene is reversible, but on translation of PR gene may maintain in a relatively longer period.
23341258	Toxic effects of environment-friendly antifoulant nonivamide on Phaeodactylum tricornutum.	Nonivamide, a synthetic derivate of natural capsaicin, has an effective antifouling activity. However, the poor understanding of the toxicity mechanism limits the application of nonivamide in antifouling paints. The present study investigated the inhibitory effects and toxicity mechanism of nonivamide on Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Under a 1.5 × 10(5) cells/ml of initial algal density (IAD), the effective concentration causing 50% inhibition at 4- d (4 d-EC50) value of nonivamide was 5.1 mg/L. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was significantly increased in nonivamide-treated algae. Algal antioxidants, including catalases (CAT), peroxidases (POD), superoxide dismutases (SOD), and glutathione (GSH), were all stimulated by the ROS burst. The excessive ROS substances led to the loss of algal photosynthetic pigments and also damage to the integrity of the lipid membrane. Furthermore, ROS-related genes, including psbA, psbD, psaB, rbcL, nad1, and cob, were found to be suppressed in the chloroplasts and mitochondria of nonivamide-treated algae, and the concentration of cytoplasmic Ca(2+) , an important regulator of chloroplast and mitochondrion, was elevated. The present study demonstrates that nonivamide could cause peroxidative damages to P. tricornutum by inducing ROS overproduction, which may be initiated by the suppression of ROS-related genes in algal chloroplasts and mitochondria.
17929114	The Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib and promising new agents against Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemias.	Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) was the first human malignant disease to be linked to a single, acquired genetic abnormality. Identification of the Bcr-Abl kinase fusion protein and its pivotal role in the pathogenesis of CML provided new opportunities to develop molecular-targeted therapies. Imatinib mesylate (IM, Gleevec, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Basel, Switzerland), which specifically inhibits the autophosphorylation of the Abl TK, has improved the treatment of CML. However, resistance is often reported in patients with advanced-stage disease. Several novel TK inhibitors have been developed that override IM resistance mechanisms caused by point mutations within the Abl kinase domain. Inhibitors of Abl TK are divided into two main groups, namely, ATP-competitive and ATP noncompetitive inhibitors. The ATP-competitive inhibitors fall into two subclasses, the Src/Abl inhibitors, and the 2-phenylaminopyrimidine-based compounds. Dasatinib (formerly BMS-354825), AP23464, SKI-606, and PD166326 are classified as Src/Abl inhibitors, while nilotinib (AMN107) and INNO-406 (NS-187) belong to the latter subclass of inhibitors. Of these agents, dasatinib and nilotinib underwent clinical trials earlier than the others and favorable results are now accumulating. Clinical studies of the other compounds, including SKI-606 and INNO-406, have been performed in rapid succession. Because of their strong affinities for the ATP-binding site compared to IM, most ATP-competitive inhibitors may be effective in IM-resistant patients. However, an ATP-competitive inhibitor that can inhibit the phosphorylation of T315I Bcr-Abl has not yet been developed. Instead, ATP noncompetitive inhibitors, such as ON012380, Aurora kinase inhibitor MK0457 (VX-680), and p38 MAP kinase inhibitor BIRB-796, have been developed to address this problem. This review provides an update on the underlying pathophysiologies of disease progression and IM resistance, and discusses the development of new targeted TK inhibitors for managing CML and the importance of future strategies targeting CML stem cells.
23246732	Influence of developmental lead exposure on expression of DNA methyltransferases and methyl cytosine-binding proteins in hippocampus.	Developmental exposure to lead (Pb) has adverse effects on cognitive functioning and behavior that can persist into adulthood. Exposures that occur during fetal or early life periods may produce changes in brain related to physiological re-programming from an epigenetic influence such as altered DNA methylation status. Since DNA methylation is regulated by DNA methyltransferases and methyl cytosine-binding proteins, this study assessed the extent to which developmental Pb exposure might affect expression of these proteins in the hippocampus. Long Evans dams were fed chow with or without added Pb acetate (0, 150, 375, 750 ppm) prior to breeding and remained on the same diet through weaning (perinatal exposure group). Other animals were exposed to the same doses of Pb but exposure started on postnatal day 1 and continued through weaning (early postnatal exposure group). All animals were euthanized on day 55 and hippocampi were removed. Western blot analyses showed significant effects of Pb exposure on DNMT1, DNMT3a, and MeCP2 expression, with effects often seen at the lowest level of exposure and modified by sex and developmental window of Pb exposure. These data suggest potential epigenetic effects of developmental Pb exposure on DNA methylation mediated at least in part through dysregulation of methyltransferases.
23624148	Sciadopitysin protects osteoblast function via its antioxidant activity in MC3T3-E1 cells.	Age-related osteoblast dysfunction is the main cause of age-related bone loss in both men and women. In the present study, the effect of sciadopitysin, a type of biflavonoids, on osteoblast function was investigated in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. Sciadopitysin caused a significant elevation of alkaline phosphatase activity, collagen synthesis, osteocalcin production, mineralization, and glutathione content in the cells (P<0.05). Sciadopitysin also decreased the production of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-α) induced by antimycin A, a mitochondrial electron transport inhibitor. We investigated the protective effects of sciadopitysin on antimycin A-induced toxicity in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. Exposure of MC3T3-E1 cells to antimycin A caused a significant reduction in osteoblast dysfunction. However, pretreatment with sciadopitysin prior to antimycin A exposure significantly reduced antimycin A-induced cell damage by preventing mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) loss, reactive oxygen species (ROS) release, and nitrotyrosine increase, suggesting that sciadopitysin may be useful for protecting mitochondria against a burst of oxidative stress. Moreover, sciadopitysin increased phosphorylation of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) inhibited by antimycin A. Our results demonstrate that sciadopitysin may reduce or prevent osteoblasts degeneration.
17324065	Differential activation of cAMP response element binding protein in discrete nucleus accumbens subregions during early and late cocaine sensitization.	The present study examined the differential cocaine-induced activation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding protein (CREB) throughout discrete zones of analysis of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in rats. CREB-dependent gene transcription, which may underlie long-lasting drug-induced changes in behavior and the subjective effects of cocaine, varies depending on the stage of drug exposure or withdrawal and the cell population involved. Using immunohistochemistry, the authors analyzed changes in CREB phosphorylation in the NAc after 5 days of cocaine, a short or long drug-free period, and a subsequent challenge injection. The NAc shell was separated into 5 zones of analysis previously defined by neurochemistry and connectivity. Repeated cocaine resulted in CREB phosphorylation in all analyzed subregions of the NAc excluding the most ventrolateral region of the shell 2 weeks after cessation of repeated cocaine, but rats challenged after 2 drug-free days yielded a more localized activation of CREB in the 3 most dorsomedial zones of the shell. The temporal and anatomical determinants of cocaine-induced CREB activity may indicate functional differences among NAc shell subregions and suggest the involvement of CREB in early and late cocaine effects.
17228881	Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. DNA cloning, characterization, and inhibition studies of the human secretory isoform VI, a new target for sulfonamide and sulfamate inhibitors.	The secretory isozyme of human carbonic anhydrase (hCA, EC 4.2.1.1), hCA VI, has been cloned, expressed, and purified in a bacterial expression system. The kinetic parameters for the CO2 hydration reaction proved hCA VI to possess a kcat of 3.4 x 10(5) s-1 and kcat/KM of 4.9 x 10(7) M-1 s-1 (at pH 7.5 and 20 degrees C). hCA VI has a significant catalytic activity for the physiological reaction on the same order of magnitude as the ubiquitous isoform CA I or the transmembrane, tumor-associated isozyme CA IX. A series of sulfonamides and one sulfamate have been tested for their interaction with this isozyme. Simple benzenesulfonamides were rather ineffective hCA VI inhibitors, with inhibition constants in the range of 1090-6680 nM. Better inhibitors were detected among such derivatives bearing 2- or 4-amino-, 4-aminomethyl-, or 4-hydroxymethyl moieties or among halogenated sulfanilamides (KI values of 608-955 nM). Some clinically used compounds, such as acetazolamide, methazolamide, ethoxzolamide, dichlorophenamide, dorzolamide, brinzolamide, topiramate, sulpiride, and indisulam, or the orphan drug benzolamide, showed effective hCA VI inhibitory activity, with inhibition constants of 0.8-79 nM. The best inhibitors were brinzolamide and sulpiride (KI values of 0.8-0.9 nM), the latter compound being also a CA VI-selective inhibitor. The metallic taste reported as a side effect after the treatment with systemic sulfonamides may be due to the inhibition of the salivary CA VI. Some of the compounds investigated in this study might be used as additives in toothpastes for reducing the acidification produced by the relevant CO2 hydrase activity of enamel CA VI, which leads to the formation of protons and bicarbonate and may have a role in cariogenesis.
23211707	Steroid receptor coactivator-1 mediates estrogenic actions to prevent body weight gain in female mice.	Estrogen receptor-α (ERα) expressed by hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin and steroidogenic factor-1 neurons largely mediates the antiobesity effects of estrogens in females. However, the critical molecular events that are coupled to ERα and mediate estrogenic effects on energy balance remain unknown. In the current study, we demonstrated that steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC1), a nuclear receptor coactivator, is abundantly expressed by both proopiomelanocortin and steroidogenic factor-1 neurons. We further showed that central administration of an ERα agonist, propyl pyrazole triol, acutely increases physical interaction between SRC1 and ERα in the hypothalamus. Finally, we demonstrated that the effects of estrogens on energy homeostasis are significantly blunted in female mice lacking SRC1 globally. Collectively our results indicate that SRC1 is functionally required to mediate the antiobesity effects of estrogen-ERα signals.
16554356	Covalent linkage of apolipoprotein e to albumin nanoparticles strongly enhances drug transport into the brain.	Drug delivery to the brain is becoming more and more important but is severely restricted by the blood-brain barrier. Nanoparticles coated with polysorbates have previously been shown to enable the transport of several drugs across the blood-brain barrier, which under normal circumstances is impermeable to these compounds. Apolipoprotein E was suggested to mediate this drug transport across the blood-brain barrier. In the present study, apolipoprotein E was coupled by chemical methods to nanoparticles made of human serum albumin (HSA-NP). Loperamide, which does not cross the blood-brain barrier but exerts antinociceptive effects after direct injection into the brain, was used as model drug. Apolipoprotein E was chemically bound via linkers to loperamide-loaded HSA-NP. This preparation induced antinociceptive effects in the tail-flick test in ICR mice after i.v. injection. In contrast, nanoparticles linked to apolipoprotein E variants that do not recognize lipoprotein receptors failed to induce these effects. These results indicate that apolipoprotein E attached to the surface of nanoparticles facilitates transport of drugs across the blood-brain barrier, probably after interaction with lipoprotein receptors on the brain capillary endothelial cell membranes.
11752096	In vivo selection of antifolate-resistant transgenic hematopoietic stem cells in a murine bone marrow transplant model.	Currently, low levels of stable gene transfer into hematopoietic tissues of large animals and humans continues to limit the clinical application of gene therapy. One strategy for overcoming this problem is to selectively expand, in vivo, the population of successfully gene-modified cells. Recent work has shown that nucleoside transport inhibition in combination with antifolates can be used to select in vivo for hematopoietic stem cells expressing drug-resistant dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). In this study we investigated whether trimetrexate (TMTX) and the nucleoside transport inhibitor prodrug nitrobenzylmercaptopurine ribose phosphate (NBMPR-P) can be used to select for tyr22-variant DHFR expressing transgenic hematopoietic cells in a murine bone marrow transplant model. Our results indicate that 40 mg/kg TMTX and 20 mg/kg NBMPR-P can be used in combination to expand transgene-positive progenitor cells 3- to 4-fold immediately following drug administration. In addition, long-term progenitor populations were expanded 2- to 3-fold in primary recipients, to approximately 5 months following drug administration. Secondary transplants conducted with marrow from primary recipients 5 months following drug administration revealed a statistically significant selective expansion of transgene-positive cells in the spleens and peripheral blood of these animals. No such expansion was observed in groups of mice treated with TMTX alone or NBMPR-P alone. We conclude that TMTX + NBMPR-P can be used to selectively expand transgenic tyr22-variant DHFR expressing murine hematopoietic stem cells in vivo.
23183084	Progestin effects on expression of AKR1C1-AKR1C3, SRD5A1 and PGR in the Z-12 endometriotic epithelial cell line.	Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterine cavity. This disease is associated with diminished protective effects of progesterone, which are usually explained by inadequate activation of progesterone receptors and also enhanced pre-receptor metabolism of progesterone. Endometriosis is often treated with progestins, which act as progesterone receptor agonists, although their exact mechanisms of action are not completely understood. The aim of the present study was to investigate how the progestins medroxyprogesterone acetate, dydrogesterone and dienogest, as well as progesterone, impact on the expression of genes of pre-receptor progesterone metabolism in Z-12 epithelial cell line, a model system of peritoneal endometriosis. Our data demonstrate that these progestins affect local pre-receptor metabolism to a different extent. The most favorable effects were seen for dydrogesterone and dienogest, where the first, dydrogesterone, significantly reduced SRD5A1, AKR1C2 and AKR1C3 expression, and additionally had a nonsignificant impact on progesterone receptor B (PR-B) protein levels. This might slow down the first step of pre-receptor metabolism, the conversion of progesterone to 5α-dihydroprogestrone by SRD5A1, and it might also affect further reduction of 3-keto and 20-keto groups catalyzed by AKR1C2 and AKR1C3. Similarly favorable effects were seen for dienogest, which promoted significant reduction of AKR1C1 and AKR1C2 expression and also showed no effect on PR-B protein levels. Different effects were seen for progesterone, which significantly decreased SRD5A1, PR-B and HSD17B2 protein levels. In contrast, treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate resulted in increased AKR1C1 expression and decreased levels of PR-B, which might lead to enhanced progesterone metabolism and reduced signaling through progesterone receptors. Altogether, our data in this Z-12 cell model suggest that the beneficial effects of treatment with progestin observed in endometriosis patients might arise from decreased pre-receptor metabolism of the protective progesterone by the SRD5A1 and AKR1C enzymes.
23260350	Identification of benzofuran central cores for the inhibition of leukotriene A(4) hydrolase.	Leukotrienes (LT's) are known to play a physiological role in inflammatory immune response. Leukotriene A(4) hydrolase (LTA(4)H) is a cystolic enzyme that stereospecifically catalyzes the transformation of LTA(4) to LTB(4). LTB(4) is a known pro-inflammatory mediator. This paper describes the identification and synthesis of substituted benzofurans as LTH(4)H inhibitors. The benzofuran series demonstrated reduced mouse and human whole blood LTB(4) levels in vitro and led to the identification one analog for advanced profiling. Benzofuran 28 showed dose responsive target engagement and provides a useful tool to explore a LTA(4)H inhibitor for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, such as asthma and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
2567596	High affinity, saturable [3H]mepyramine binding sites on rat liver plasma membrane do not represent histamine H1-receptors. A warning.	Rat liver plasma membrane contains a saturable, high affinity binding site for the labelled histamine H1-antagonist [3H]mepyramine. Nonlinear regression analysis of the performed saturation experiments revealed an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 7.7 +/- 0.4 nM and a maximal binding capacity (Bmax) of 70.4 +/- 9.5 pmol/mg protein. Specific binding could be inhibited completely by several histaminergic ligands. However, the affinities of the tested H1-antagonists other than mepyramine for this binding site were quite low and the known stereospecificity displayed by the histamine H1-receptor for the enantiomers of chlorpheniramine and pheniramine was not found. Moreover, the H2-selective agonist 4-methylhistamine (Ki = 412 microM) was even more potent than its H1-selective 2-methylderivative (Ki = 772 microM). Since several ethylenediamines were also very potent in displacing [3H]mepyramine we suggest the presence of an ethylenediamine recognition site on rat liver plasma membrane which is unrelated to the histamine H1-receptor. It is stressed that a proper pharmacological characterization of a reported binding site is needed, since we show in this study that [3H]mepyramine, which is frequently used in studies concerning the H1-receptor, labels non-H1-receptor binding sites in rat liver plasma membrane.
18686730	Formoterol in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.	Bronchodilators represent the hallmark of symptomatic treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). There are four categories of bronchodilators: anticholinergics, methylxanthines, short-acting beta2-agonists, and long-acting beta2-agonists such as formoterol. Significant research has been performed to investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of formoterol in the therapeutic field of COPD. Formoterol exhibits a rapid onset of bronchodilation similar to that observed with salbutamol, yet its long bronchodilatory duration is comparable to salmeterol. In addition, formoterol presents with a clear superiority in lung function improvement compared with either ipratropium bromide or oral theophylline, while its efficacy improves when administered in combination with ipratropium. Formoterol has been shown to better reduce dynamic hyperinflation, which is responsible for exercise intolerance and dyspnea in COPD patients, compared with other bronchodilators, whereas it exerts synergistic effect with tiotropium. Moreover, formoterol reduces exacerbations, increases days free of use of rescue medication and improves patients' quality of life and disease symptoms. Formoterol has a favorable safety profile and is better tolerated than theophylline. Collectively, data extracted from multicenter clinical trials support formoterol as a valid therapeutic option in the treatment of COPD.
23376354	Ion channel remodeling in vascular smooth muscle during hypertension: Implications for novel therapeutic approaches.	Ion channels are multimeric, transmembrane proteins that selectively mediate ion flux across the plasma membrane in a variety of cells including vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). The dynamic interplay of Ca(2+) and K(+) channels on the plasma membrane of VSMCs plays a pivotal role in modulating the vascular tone of small arteries and arterioles. The abnormally-elevated arterial tone observed in hypertension thus points to an aberrant expression and function of Ca(2+) and K(+) channels in the VSMCs. In this short review, we focus on the three well-studied ion channels in VSMCs, namely the L-type Ca(2+) (CaV1.2) channels, the voltage-gated K(+) (KV) channels, and the large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (BK) channels. First, we provide a brief overview on the physiological role of vascular CaV1.2, KV and BK channels in regulating arterial tone. Second, we discuss the current understanding of the expression changes and regulation of CaV1.2, KV and BK channels in the vasculature during hypertension. Third, based on available proof-of-concept studies, we describe the potential therapeutic approaches targeting these vascular ion channels in order to restore blood pressure to normotensive levels.
23628762	Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-associated mutants of GDAP1 dissociate its roles in peroxisomal and mitochondrial fission.	Mitochondria and peroxisomes can be fragmented by the process of fission. The fission machineries of both organelles share a set of proteins. GDAP1 is a tail-anchored protein of mitochondria and induces mitochondrial fragmentation. Mutations in GDAP1 lead to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), an inherited peripheral neuropathy, and affect mitochondrial dynamics. Here, we show that GDAP1 is also targeted to peroxisomes mediated by the import receptor Pex19. Knockdown of GDAP1 leads to peroxisomal elongation that can be rescued by re-expressing GDAP1 and by missense mutated forms found in CMT patients. GDAP1-induced peroxisomal fission is dependent on the integrity of its hydrophobic domain 1, and on Drp1 and Mff, as is mitochondrial fission. Thus, GDAP1 regulates mitochondrial and peroxisomal fission by a similar mechanism. However, our results reveal also a more critical role of the amino-terminal GDAP1 domains, carrying most CMT-causing mutations, in the regulation of mitochondrial compared to peroxisomal fission.
23160090	Hydroxysafflor yellow a inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory signal transduction in human alveolar epithelial A549 cells.	Hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA) is an active ingredient obtained from the flower of Carthamus tinctorius L. The present study investigated the effects of HSYA on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory signal transduction in human alveolar epithelial A549 cells. A549 cells stimulated with LPS were incubated with three doses of HSYA (1, 4 and 16μmol/L). HSYA suppressed the expression of TLR-4, Myd88, ICAM-1, TNFα, IL-1β and IL-6 at the mRNA and protein level, and inhibited the adhesion of leukocytes to A549 cells. HSYA treatment also decreased NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation and inhibited the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK). These findings suggest that HSYA effectively inhibits LPS-induced inflammatory signal transduction in A549 cells.
16982289	Hepatic disorders in patients treated with COX-2 selective inhibitors or nonselective NSAIDs: a case/noncase analysis of spontaneous reports.	BACKGROUND: Hepatic adverse events associated with the use of nonaspirin drugs and NSAIDs are uncommon, but the widespread use of these drugs may impact public health. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a case/noncase analysis of spontaneous reports to compare the hepatic safety profile of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 selective inhibitors with that of nonselective NSAIDs. METHODS: This case/noncase analysis was conducted using the US Food and Drug Administration Freedom of Information (FDA/FOI) database (through quarter 1, 2003) and the World Health Organization Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO/UMC) database (through quarter 3, 2003). Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences and WHO Adverse Reaction Terminology preferred terms were used to classify hepatic disorders with broad and specific case definitions. After reports involving established hepatotoxic drugs (bromfenac, nimesulide, sulindac) were excluded, the proportion of reports (PRs) of each case definition was calculated for each NSAID. Crude and adjusted reporting odds ratios (RORs) were used to compare the overall proportions of hepatic disorders and hepatic failure of celecoxib and rofecoxib versus nonselective NSAIDs. RESULTS: A total of 158,539 and 185,253 reports of NSAIDs were identified in the FDA/FOI and WHO/UMC databases and 25% and 16%, respectively, involved other hepatotoxic drugs. The PRs of hepatic disorders for all COX-2 selective inhibitors and non-selective NSAIDs were 3.0% in the FDA/FOI database and 2.7% in the WHO/UMC database. In the FDA/FOI and WHO/UMC databases, respectively, mmesulide (16.7% and 14.4%), bromfenac (12.0% and 20.7%), diclofenac (8.1% and 4.7%), and sulindac (6.1 % and 9.9%) were reported to be associated with higher proportions of overall hepatic disorders compared with those of other NSAIDs. Crude and adjusted RORs for the prevalences of overall hepatic disorders and hepatic failure with celecoxib and rofecoxib versus the other NSAIDs were <1 (indicating that the proportion was not higher than that of the comparator) in both databases. The interpretation of the results was unchanged when bromfenac, nimesulide, and sulindac were excluded from the analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In this case/noncase analysis, bromfenac, nimesulide, sulindac, and diclofenac had higher proportions of reports of hepatic disorders compared with those of other NSAIDs in the FDA/FOI and WHO/UMC databases. The analysis did not raise a safety concern for celecoxib or rofecoxib versus NSAIDs for overall hepatic disorders and hepatic failure.
17592198	Mitiglinide, a novel oral hypoglycemic agent, preserves the cardioprotective effect of ischemic preconditioning in isolated perfused rat hearts.	Diabetic patients often have manifestation of coronary heart disease. As a consequence, therapeutic strategies for diabetes should pay more attention to hypoglycemic agents which do not have adverse effects on myocardium. Mitiglinide is considered to have little or no impact on the cardioprotective effect of ischemic preconditioning (IP) because of its high selectivity for blocking sulfonylurea receptor1 (SUR1). However, glibenclamide, a nonselective SUR blocker, attenuates this beneficial effect. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that mitiglinide preserves the protective action of IP evaluated by ischemia/reperfusion ventricular tachyarrhythmia (rVT) in isolated perfused rat hearts. After initial perfusion, the hearts were assigned to one of the following groups: 1) non-IP with control perfusion buffer (non-IP group); 2) IP with control perfusion buffer (IP-C group); 3) IP with perfusion buffer containing glibenclamide (IP-G group); and 4) IP with perfusion buffer containing mitiglinide (IP-M group). The protocol for the non-IP group consisted of 21 minutes of aerobic perfusion before 10 minutes of ischemia. In the other 3 groups (IP groups), there were 3 cycles of 2-minute ischemia followed by 5 minutes of reperfusion before 10 minutes of ischemia. The IP-C group had a significantly shorter rVT duration than the non-IP group (4.4 +/- 1.8 minutes versus 14.3 +/- 2.5 minutes; P < 0.05). rVT duration was the shortest in the IP-M group (3.9 +/- 1.0 minutes), but among the longest in the IP-G group (14.0 +/- 2.6 minutes). In conclusion, mitiglinide preserved the cardioprotective effect of IP, however, glibenclamide abolished this beneficial effect. Therefore, mitiglinide may offer a long-term benefit for myocardial ischemia in diabetic patients.
23353736	Synthesis of derivatives of methyl rosmarinate and their inhibitory activities against matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1).	A series of MMP-1 inhibitors have been identified based upon a methyl rosmarinate scaffold using structure-based drug design methods. The best compound in the series showed an IC50 value of 0.4 μM. A docking study was conducted for compound (S)-10n in order to investigate its binding interactions with MMP-1. The structure-activity relationships (SAR) were also briefly discussed. Useful SAR was established which provides important guidelines for the design of future generations of potent inhibitors against MMP-1.
16818276	Expression of human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1) and its correlation with gemcitabine uptake and cytotoxicity in mantle cell lymphoma.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Nucleoside transporters might play a relevant role in the intracellular targeting of many nucleoside analogs used in anticancer therapy. Two gene families (SLC28 and SLC29) encode the two types of human nucleoside transporters, concentrative nucleoside transporter (CNT) and equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT) proteins. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells express both SLC28- and SLC29-related mRNA, although transport function seems to be mostly related to ENT-type transporters. Here we have analyzed the role of nucleoside transporters in nucleoside-derived drug bioavailability and action in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cells. DESIGN AND METHODS: The relative amounts of hENT1 and hENT2-related mRNA and protein were analyzed in five MCL cell lines and 20 primary MCL tumors by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and western blots. Cell viability, measured by annexin V-FITC staining, and nucleoside-derived drug transport were also studied. RESULTS: MCL cells express higher levels of hENT1 protein than do CLL cells, and a good correlation was found between protein and mRNA levels of hENT1, thus indirectly suggesting that hENT1 might be transcriptionally regulated in MCL cells. More importantly, a significant correlation between these two parameters, drug uptake and sensitivity to gemcitabine, was also observed. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These results further support the concept that nucleoside transporters are implicated in the therapeutic response to nucleoside analogs, and suggest a particular and novel role for hENT1 in the genotoxic response to selected nucleoside analogs, such as gemcitabine, in MCL cells.
2857786	Self-cancellation of drug properties as a mode of organ selectivity: the antimuscarinic effects of ambenonium.	Ambenonium is known to be an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, and recent data have shown this drug to antagonize muscarinic receptors as well. This latter property was confirmed by Schild analyses of ambenonium-induced blockade of responses to bethanechol in guinea-pig ileal longitudinal smooth muscle, taenia caeci, trachea and rat anococcygeus muscle. Statistical analysis showed ambenonium to be a simple competitive antagonist of responses to bethanechol in these tissues with pKB values in each tissue not significantly different from each other (mean pKB = 6.0). However, considerable variability in pKB estimates was encountered when ambenonium was utilized to block responses to acetylcholine. Ambenonium was a less potent antagonist of tissue responses to acetylcholine, and the underestimation in the pKB (as compared to that obtained with bethanechol) could be eliminated by prior treatment of tissues with the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor neostigmine. These data suggested that ambenonium had a dual effect on tissue responses to acetylcholine-producing potentiation by blockade of acetylcholinesterase and concomitant antagonism by blockade of muscarinic receptors. The Schild regressions obtained for ambenonium antagonism of acetylcholine responses formally satisfied criteria for simple competitive antagonism of a homogenous population of receptors (linear regression, slope equal to unity). The fact that these regressions yielded erroneous apparent pKB values suggests how two properties of a drug in one molecule could provide misleading information about drug receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
23583485	Inhibitory effects of gypenosides on seven human cytochrome P450 enzymes in vitro.	Among the various possible causes for drug interactions, pharmacokinetic factors such as inhibition of drug-metabolizing enzymes, especially cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, are regarded as the most frequent and clinically important. Gypenosides is widely used as functional food and over-the-counter drug in East Asia. In this study, the in vitro inhibitory effects of gypenosides on the major human CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4) activities in human liver microsomes were examined using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Gypenosides showed the strongest inhibition of CYP2D6, followed by CYP2C8, CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. The IC50 values were 1.61μg/mL, 20.06μg/mL, 34.76μg/mL (CYP3A4/midazolam), 46.73μg/mL (CYP3A4/testosterone), and 54.52μg/mL, respectively. Gypenosides exhibited competitive inhibition of CYP2D6 (Ki=1.18). In conclusion, Gypenosides might cause herb-drug interactions via inhibition of CYP2D6. An in vivo study is needed to examine this further.
12297509	Signaling through Gi family members in platelets. Redundancy and specificity in the regulation of adenylyl cyclase and other effectors.	Platelet responses at sites of vascular injury are regulated by intracellular cAMP levels, which rise rapidly when prostacyclin (PGI(2)) is released from endothelial cells. Platelet agonists such as ADP and epinephrine suppress PGI(2)-stimulated cAMP formation by activating receptors coupled to G(i) family members, four of which are present in platelets. To address questions about the specificity of receptor:G protein coupling, the regulation of cAMP formation in vivo and the contribution of G(i)-mediated pathways that do not involve adenylyl cyclase, we studied platelets from mice that lacked the alpha subunits of one or more of the three most abundantly expressed G(i) family members and compared the results with platelets from mice that lacked the PGI(2) receptor, IP. As reported previously, loss of G(i2)alpha or G(z)alpha inhibited aggregation in response to ADP and epinephrine, respectively, producing defects that could not be reversed by adding an adenylyl cyclase inhibitor. Platelets that lacked both G(i2)alpha and G(z)alpha showed impaired responses to both agonists, but the impairment was no greater than in the individual knockouts. Loss of G(i3)alpha had no effect either alone or in combination with G(z)alpha. Loss of either G(z)alpha or G(i2)alpha impaired the ability of ADP and epinephrine to inhibit PGI(2)-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity and caused a 40%-50% rise in basal cAMP levels, whereas loss of G(i3)alpha did not. Conversely, deletion of IP abolished responses to PGI(2) and caused cAMP levels to fall by 30%, effects that did not translate into enhanced responsiveness to agonists ex vivo. From these results we conclude that 1) cAMP levels in circulating platelets reflect ongoing signaling through G(i2), G(z), and IP, but not G(i3); 2) platelet epinephrine (alpha(2A)-adrenergic) and ADP (P2Y12) receptors display strong preferences among G(i) family members with little evidence of redundancy; and 3) these receptor preferences do not extend to G(i3). Finally, the failure of ADP and epinephrine to inhibit basal, as opposed to PGI(2)-stimulated, cAMP formation highlights the need during platelet activation for G(i) signaling pathways that involve effectors other than adenylyl cyclase.
23568856	Non-classical Pharmacology of the Dopamine Transporter: Atypical Inhibitors, Allosteric Modulators and Partial Substrates.	The dopamine transporter (DAT) is a sodium-coupled symporter protein responsible for modulating the concentration of extraneuronal dopamine in the brain. The DAT is a principle target of various psychostimulant, nootropic and antidepressant drugs, as well as certain drugs used recreationally, including the notoriously addictive stimulant cocaine. DAT ligands have traditionally been divided into two categories: cocaine-like inhibitors and amphetamine-like substrates. Whereas inhibitors block monoamine uptake by the DAT, but are not translocated across the membrane, substrates are actively translocated and trigger DAT-mediated release of dopamine by reversal of the translocation cycle. As both inhibitors and substrates increase extraneuronal dopamine levels, it is often assumed that all DAT ligands posses an addictive liability equivalent to cocaine. However, the recent development of novel 'atypical' inhibitors and 'partial substrate' ligands with reduced or even a complete lack of cocaine-like rewarding effects suggests that addictiveness is not a constant property of DAT-affecting compounds. These atypical ligands do not conform to the classical preconception that all DAT inhibitors (or substrates) are functionally and mechanistically alike. Instead, they suggest the possibility that the DAT exhibits some of the ligand-specific 'pleiotropic' functional qualities inherent to G-protein-coupled receptors. That is, ligands with different chemical structures induce specific conformational changes in the transporter protein, which can be differentially transduced by the cell, ultimately eliciting unique behavioral and psychical effects. The present overview discusses compounds with conformation-specific activity, useful not only as tools for studying the mechanics of dopamine transport, but also as leads for medication development in addictive disorders.
23205514	Effects of single or repeated silymarin administration on pharmacokinetics of risperidone and its major metabolite, 9-hydroxyrisperidone in rats.	1. The interactions between herbal dietary supplements and therapeutic drugs have emerged as an important issue and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) has been reported as one of the significant factors of these interactions. 2. The objective of this article is to examine the effects of single and repeated administrations of silymarin on pharmacokinetics of a P-gp substrate, risperidone, and its major metabolite, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, in rats. 3. To determine the plasma levels of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone in rats, a HPLC method was developed using a liquid-liquid acid back extraction. When risperidone (6 mg/kg) was co-administered with silymarin (40 mg/kg) to rats orally, the C(max) of 9-hydroxyrisperidone was significantly increased to1.3-fold (p < 0.05), while the other pharmacokinetic parameters did not show any significant differences. Expanding the experiment where rats were repeatedly administered with silymarin for 5 days prior to giving risperidone, the C(max) of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone were significantly increased to 2.4-fold (p < 0.001) and 1.7-fold (p < 0.001), respectively, and the AUC(0-t), as well to 1.7-fold (p < 0.05) and 2.1-fold (p < 0.01), respectively. 4. The repeated exposures of silymarin, compared to single administration of silymarin, increased oral bioavailability and affected the pharmacokinetics of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone, by inhibiting P-gp.
22751286	Dietary flaxseed oil supplementation ameliorates the effect of cisplatin on brush border membrane enzymes and antioxidant system in rat intestine.	Cisplatin (CP; cis-diamminedichloroplatinum II) is a drug widely used against different types of solid tumors. Patients receiving CP, however, experience very profound and long lasting gastrointestinal symptoms. Recently, ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid-enriched flaxseed/flaxseed oil (FXO) has shown numerous health benefits. The present study was undertaken to investigate whether FXO can prevent CP-induced adverse biochemical changes in the small intestine of rats. A single intraperitoneal dose of CP (6 mg/kg body weight) was administered to male Wistar rats fed with control diet (CP group) and FXO diet (CPFXO group). Administration of CP led to a significant decline in the specific activities of brush border membrane enzymes both in the mucosal homogenates and in the isolated membrane vesicles. Lipid peroxidation and total sulfhydryl groups were altered upon CP treatment, indicating the generation of oxidative stress. The activities of SOD, catalase and glutathione peroxidase also decreased in CP-treated rats. In contrast, dietary supplementation of FXO prior to and following CP treatment significantly attenuated the CP-induced changes in all these parameters. FXO feeding markedly enhanced resistance to CP-elicited adverse gastrointestinal effects. The results suggest that FXO owing to its intrinsic biochemical/antioxidant properties is an effective agent in reducing the adverse effects of CP on intestine.
9563368	Development of fluticasone propionate and comparison with other inhaled corticosteroids.	Fluticasone propionate (FP) is a trifluorinated glucocorticoid based on the androstane nucleus. It was selected for development from structure-activity relationships (topical anti-inflammatory, cutaneous vasoconstriction, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression) of a series of 17beta-carbothioates. FP is 3-, 300-, and 1000-fold more lipophilic than beclomethasone dipropionate, budesonide, and triamcinolone acetonide, respectively. FP has an absolute affinity (KD) for the glucocorticoid receptor of 0.5 nmol/L and a relative receptor affinity 1.5-fold higher than beclomethasone-17-monopropionate (17-BMP) and mometasone furoate, 3-fold higher than budesonide, and 20-fold higher than flunisolide and triamcinolone acetonide. The rate of association of FP with the receptor is faster and the rate of dissociation slower than other corticosteroids. The resulting half-life of the FP active steroid-receptor complex is >10 hours, compared with approximately 5, 7.5, and 4 hours for budesonide, 17-BMP, and triamcinolone acetonide, respectively. FP has high selectivity for the glucocorticoid receptor, with little or no activity at other steroid receptors. FP is more potent than beclomethasone dipropionate, budesonide, triamcinolone acetonide, and mometasone furoate in inhibiting human T-cell migration and proliferation, inhibiting CD4+ T-cell cytokine and basophil histamine release, attenuating adhesion molecule expression, stimulating inflammatory cell apoptosis, and inducing cellular antiprotease release. In asthma patients, FP decreases the number of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD25+ T cells, mast cells, and eosinophils in bronchial biopsies, in addition to suppressing CD1a-dendritic and IgE+ cells and HLA-DR. FP, therefore, has a good pharmacologic profile for a topical steroid with increased intrinsic glucocorticoid potency and potent anti-inflammatory activity.
23517028	Biophysical Fragment Screening of the β1-Adrenergic Receptor: Identification of High Affinity Arylpiperazine Leads Using Structure-Based Drug Design.	Biophysical fragment screening of a thermostabilized β1-adrenergic receptor (β1AR) using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) enabled the identification of moderate affinity, high ligand efficiency (LE) arylpiperazine hits 7 and 8. Subsequent hit to lead follow-up confirmed the activity of the chemotype, and a structure-based design approach using protein-ligand crystal structures of the β1AR resulted in the identification of several fragments that bound with higher affinity, including indole 19 and quinoline 20. In the first example of GPCR crystallography with ligands derived from fragment screening, structures of the stabilized β1AR complexed with 19 and 20 were determined at resolutions of 2.8 and 2.7 Å, respectively.
23364612	Green approach&#8212;multicomponent production of boron&#8212;containing hantzsch and biginelli esters.	Multicomponent reactions are excellent methods that meet the requirements of green chemistry, by reducing the number of steps, and consequently reducing purification requirements. Accordingly, in this work, 11 novel hybrid-boron-containing molecules, namely eight 1,4-dihydropyridines and three 3,4-dihydropyrimidinones, derived from formylphenylboronic acids (ortho, meta and para), were obtained using a green approach, involving H-4CR and B-3CR practices, in the presence of ethanol, which is a green solvent, and using three comparatively different modes of activation (mantle heating, yield 3%-7% in 24 h, Infrared Radiation (IR) irradiation, yield 12%-17% in 12 h, and microwave irradiation, yield 18%-80%, requiring very low reaction times of 0.25-0.33 h). In addition, as a green-approach is offered, a convenient analysis, of the 12 green chemistry principles for the overall procedure was performed. Finally, since all the products are new, characterizations were carried out using common analytic procedures (1H, 11B, and 13C NMR, FAB+MS, HRMS, and IR). The accurate mass data of unexpected ions related to interactions between thioglycerol and the expected products, in the FAB+-mode, enabled unequivocal characterization of the target molecules.
7974294	Heterogeneous expression and polymorphic genotype of glutathione S-transferases in human lung.	BACKGROUND: Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics by conjugation with glutathione. One of the mu class genes of this superfamily of enzymes, GSTM1, is polymorphic because of a partial gene deletion. This results in a failure to express GSTM1 in approximately 50% of individuals. Several studies have linked GSTM1 null status to an increased risk of lung carcinoma. This study investigated the expression and distribution of GST isoenzymes in human lung, and developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay which would allow genotyping of archival, paraffin embedded lung tissue. METHODS: Distribution was examined using a panel of polyclonal anti-GST antibodies for immunohistochemistry in normal tissue of 21 tumour-bearing lungs. DNA for PCR was extracted from paraffin blocks and a control group of 350 blood lysates. As a positive control each assay amplified part of GSTM4, a mu class gene which is not polymorphic but which shows strong sequence homology to GSTM1. The presence of GST in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was sought by Western analysis. RESULTS: Proximal airways contained pi class GST, alpha class GST, and mu class GST with expression concentrated in the brush border. In distal airspaces no alpha GST was expressed but pi GST and mu GST were present in alveolar cells and also alveolar macrophages. Pi class GST was present in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. The PCR assay enabled genotypic determination using DNA extracted from archival material. Of the control group 56% were null at the GSTM1 locus. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of GST isoenzymes in the lung is heterogeneous with an apparent decrease in GST in distal lung. Since GSTM1 status has already been associated with susceptibility to disease, the PCR assay developed will allow further studies of the relation between genotype and structural disorders in the lung using archival pathological material.
1881457	N2-acetylphenelzine: effects on rat brain GABA, alanine and biogenic amines.	The neurochemical properties of N2-acetylphenelzine were compared with those of phenelzine in a rat model. N2-Acetylphenelzine is a relatively potent inhibitor of monoamine oxidase-A and -B and causes increases in whole-brain levels of noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine, and decreases in homovanillic acid, 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acetic after acute i.p. administration of the drug. Phenelzine is a more potent monoamine oxidase inhibitor than is N2-acetylphenelzine. The most marked difference in the profile was that N2-acetylphenelzine had no effect on whole brain levels of the amino acid neurotransmitters alanine and gamma-aminobutyric acid, whereas phenelzine caused dramatic increases. Acetylation of phenelzine at the N2 position presumably interferes with the inhibition of the transaminase enzymes for gamma-aminobutyric acid and alanine.
14505791	Compared pharmacological characteristics in humans of racemic cetirizine and levocetirizine, two histamine H1-receptor antagonists.	The potent histamine H(1)-receptor antagonist cetirizine (Zyrtec) is a racemic mixture of levocetirizine (now available under the trademark Xyzal and dextrocetirizine. In this Commentary, we examine some biological properties of cetirizine and levocetirizine, namely enantioselectivity in pharmacological activity and pharmacokinetic properties, with emphasis on the possibility of racemization, the compared behavior of the two enantiomers, and the potential for interactions with other drugs. Recent data demonstrate that the antihistaminergic activity of the racemate is primarily due to levocetirizine. Levocetirizine is rapidly and extensively absorbed, poorly metabolized, and not subject to racemization. Its pharmacokinetic characteristics are comparable after administration alone or in the racemate. Its apparent volume of distribution is smaller than that of dextrocetirizine (0.41 L kg(-1) vs. 0.60 L kg(-1)). Moreover, the non-renal (mostly hepatic) clearance of levocetirizine is also significantly lower than that of dextrocetirizine (11.8 mL min(-1) vs. 29.2 mL min(-1)). Our conclusion is that levocetirizine is indeed the eutomer of cetirizine. The evidence reviewed here confirms preclinical findings and offers a rationale for the chiral switch from the racemate to levocetirizine.
1830521	Pharmacologic management of endometriosis.	The incidence, pathogenesis, staging, and treatment of endometriosis are reviewed, with an emphasis on pharmacologic management of this condition. Endometriosis--the presence of ectopic endometrial tissue--can be found in 15-25% of infertile women and may be found in 1-5% of all women between menarche and menopause. Although the pathogenesis of endometriosis is uncertain, the most tenable etiologic theory is a combination of celomic metaplasia and retrograde menstruation. Staging is based on the American Fertility Society classification scheme, with stage I being the mildest and stage IV the most severe form of the disease. The management of endometriosis depends on the extent of the disease, the severity of the symptoms, the age of the patient, and the patient's desire for future fertility. Treatment modalities include expectant management, surgery, induction of a pseudopregnancy state with hormonal therapy (e.g., oral contraceptives), or induction of a pseudomenopausal state. The induction of a pseudomenopausal state with the use of oral danazol gained widespread favor in the 1970s as the treatment of choice in patients with endometriosis, but therapy is often associated with unpleasant adverse effects. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists may provide a safe and clinically effective alternative to danazol therapy in patients with endometriosis. Results of a multicenter study comparing nafarelin with danazol for treatment of endometriosis indicated no significant differences between treatment groups with respect to improvements in disease state and symptomatology. The most common adverse effect associated with nafarelin therapy is hot flashes. The GnRH agonist nafarelin is as effective as danazol or oral contraceptives for the treatment of endometriosis and causes fewer adverse reactions. GnRH agonists may replace danazol as the treatment of choice in patients with endometriosis.
17417877	Reduction of high-affinity beta2-adrenergic receptor binding by hyperforin and hyperoside on rat C6 glioblastoma cells measured by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy.	Beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-AR) are potential targets for antidepressants. Desensitization and downregulation of beta-AR are discussed as possible modes of action for antidepressants. We have investigated the effects of hyperforin and hyperoside, compounds with potentially antidepressant activity from St. John's Wort, on the binding behavior and dynamics of beta2-AR in living rat C6 glioblastoma cells, compared to desipramine (desmethylimipramine; DMI) by means of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and fluorescence microscopy. FCS-binding studies with the fluorescently labeled ligand Alexa532-noradrenaline (Alexa532-NA) binding to beta2-AR of C6 cells showed a significant reduction in total beta2-AR binding after preincubation with hyperforin and hyperoside for 3 days, respectively, which was also found for DMI. This was mainly observed in high-affinity receptor-ligand complexes with hindered lateral mobility (D2 = 1.1 (+/-0.4) microm2/s) in the biomembrane. However, internalization of beta2-AR was found neither in z-scans of these C6 cells nor in HEK 293 cells stably transfected with GFP-tagged beta2-adrenergic receptors (beta2AR-GFP) after incubation up to 6 days with either DMI, hyperforin, or hyperoside. Thus, under these conditions reduction of beta2-AR binding was not mediated by receptor internalization. Additionally, preincubation of C6 cells with DMI, hyperforin, and hyperoside led to a loss of second messenger cAMP after beta2-adrenergic stimulating conditions with terbutaline. Our current results indicate that hyperforin and hyperoside from St. John's Wort, as well as DMI, reduce beta2-adrenergic sensitivity in C6 cells, emphasizing the potential usefulness of St. John's Wort dry extracts in clinical treatment of depressive symptoms.
17110146	Molecular modeling of purinergic receptor P2Y12 and interaction with its antagonists.	"Purinergic receptors are a class of cell surface receptors for purines that prefer ATP or ADP over adenosine. The surface receptors for extracellular nucleotides are called P2 receptors. They are activated by both pyrimidine and purine nucleotides. ADP initiates platelet aggregation by 'simultaneous activation of two G protein-coupled receptors, P2Y1 and P2Y12. P2Y12 has been shown to be the target of the thienopyridine drugs, ticlopidine and clopidogrel. Here, the active sites of P2Y12 for ATP as well as ADP are predicted by bioinformatics and molecular modeling. First, the three-dimensional (3D) structure of P2Y12 was constructed by InsightII/Homology module using the corresponding bovine rhodopsin (PDB code: 1HZX) as the template. Then the primary structures were optimized by energy minimization that has been successfully accepted by the Protein Data Bank (PDB code: 1VZ1). Second, a simple scoring matrix was built up based on the analysis of 13 known ATP-binding proteins. And the most probable active sites of P2Y12 were predicted using the scoring matrix, which include three distant areas: ""head area"" (LGTGPLRTFV, 87-96), ""middle area"" (VGLITNGLAM, 38-47, and LGAKILSVVI, 139-148), and ""bottom area"" (RTRGVGKVPR, 222-231). Subsequently the structural model of P2Y12 was docked with ATP/ADP in comparison with P2Y1 (PDB code 1ddd). As a comparison, we docked its antagonists, such as ticlopidine and clopidogrel, to the most probable sites and calculated their intermolecular energy. Our results imply that P2Y12 has the potential to be inhibited by ADP/ATP analogs, and it suggests that P2Y12 acts as a target of new drugs that inhibit platelet aggregation."
17333137	Antipsychotic profile of rolipram: efficacy in rats and reduced sensitivity in mice deficient in the phosphodiesterase-4B (PDE4B) enzyme.	RATIONALE: Recent studies provide evidence for reduced phosphodiesterase-4B (PDE4B) as a genetic susceptibility factor as well as suggesting an association of several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PDE4B that are associated with an increased incidence of schizophrenia. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the current study was to assess the activity of rolipram, a nonsubtype-selective PDE4 inhibitor, in several animal models predictive of antipsychotic-like efficacy and side-effect liability and to use PDE4B wild-type and knockout mice to begin to understand the subtypes involved in the activity of rolipram. RESULTS: In rats, rolipram antagonized both phencyclidine hydrochloride- and D-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity and inhibited conditioned avoidance responding (CAR). In PDE4B wild-type mice, rolipram dose-dependently suppressed CAR (ED(50) = 2.4 mg/kg); however, in knockout mice, their sensitivity to rolipram at the higher doses (1.0 and 3.2 mg/kg) was reduced, resulting in a threefold shift in the ED(50) (7.3 mg/kg), suggesting PDE4B is involved, at least in part, with the activity of rolipram. Only the highest dose of rolipram (3.2 mg/kg) produced a modest but significant degree of catalepsy. CONCLUSIONS: Rolipram has a pharmacologic profile similar to that of the atypical antipsychotics and has low extrapyramidal symptom liability. These results suggest that PDE4B mediates the antipsychotic effects of rolipram in CAR and that the PDE4B-regulated cyclic adenosine monophosphate signaling pathway may play a role in the pathophysiology and pharmacotherapy of psychosis.
8937933	Pharmacodynamics of insulin Lispro in 2 patients with type II diabetes mellitus.	We studied the effects of the new rapid acting human insulin analogue (Lys(B28), Pro(B29) insulin), insulin Lispro (Lispro) on metabolic control and insulin receptor binding in type II diabetes mellitus. We investigated 2 patients: Patient 1 was obese, clearly insulin-resistant, injected high doses of insulin (3-4 IU/kg body weight), and had insufficient diabetes control. Patient 2 was of normal body weight, injected normal insulin doses (0.7-0.8 IU/kg body weight), and had good diabetes control. Patient 1 showed a considerable improvement of insulin binding after receiving Lispro (26,700 vs. 5,600 receptors/monocyte; Kd 560 vs. 1,500 pM). Concommitantly, a decrease of serum glucose and insulin dose was observed, reflecting a higher insulin sensitivity during Lispro treatment. In patient 2 injected with Lispro the time course of serum glucose, serum insulin, and insulin binding after an oral meal was comparable to values obtained in healthy controls. We conclude that the quick and pulsatile pharmacokinetic profile of the insulin analogue Lispro may improve glycemia, insulin receptor binding, and insulin resistance in type II diabetes.
23423713	Modulation of cytochrome P450 1 (Cyp1) by vanadium in hepatic tissue and isolated hepatocyte of C57BL/6 mice.	The objective of the current study was to investigate the effect of vanadium (V(5+)) on Cyp1 expression and activity in C57BL/6 mice liver and isolated hepatocytes. For this purpose, C57BL6 mice were injected intraperitoneally with V(5+) (5 mg/kg) in the absence and presence of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) (15 μg/kg) for 6 and 24 h. Furthermore, isolated hepatocytes from C57BL6 mice were treated with V(5+) (5, 10, and 20 μM) in the absence and presence of TCDD (1 nM) for 3, 6, 12, and 24 h. In vivo, V(5+) alone did not significantly alter Cyp1a1, Cyp1a2, or Cyp1b1 mRNA, protein, or catalytic activity levels. Upon co-exposure to V(5+) and TCDD, V(5+) significantly potentiated the TCDD-mediated induction of the Cyp1a1, Cyp1a2, and Cyp1b1 mRNA, protein, and catalytic activity levels at 24 h. In vitro, V(5+) decreased the TCDD-mediated induction of Cyp1a1 mRNA, protein, and catalytic activity levels. Furthermore, V(5+) significantly inhibited the TCDD-induced AhR-dependent luciferase activity. V(5+) also increased serum hemoglobin (Hb) levels in animals treated for 24 h. Upon treatment of isolated hepatocytes with Hb alone or in the presence of TCDD, there was an increase in the AhR-dependent luciferase activity. When isolated hepatocytes were treated for 2 h with V(5+) in the presence of TCDD, followed by replacement of the medium with new medium containing Hb, there was further potentiation to the TCDD-mediated effect. The present study demonstrates that there is a differential modulation of Cyp1a1 by V(5+) in C57BL/6 mice livers and isolated hepatocytes and demonstrates Hb as an in vivo specific modulator.
22890749	Theoretical study of the decomposition of ethyl and ethyl 3-phenyl glycidate.	The mechanism of the decomposition of ethyl and ethyl 3-phenyl glycidate in gas phase was studied by density functional theory (DFT) and MP2 methods. A proposed mechanism for the reaction indicates that the ethyl side of the ester is eliminated as ethylene through a concerted six-membered cyclic transition state, and the unstable intermediate glycidic acid decarboxylates rapidly to give the corresponding aldehyde. Two possible pathways for glycidic acid decarboxylation were studied: one via a five-membered cyclic transition state, and the other via a four-membered cyclic transition state. The results of the calculations indicate that the decarboxylation reaction occurs via a mechanism with five-membered cyclic transition state.
9421374	GLUT2 in pancreatic islets: crucial target molecule in diabetes induced with multiple low doses of streptozotocin in mice.	In mice, diabetes can be induced by multiple low doses of streptozotocin (MLD-STZ), i.e., 40 mg/kg body wt on each of 5 consecutive days. In this model, diabetes develops only when STZ induces both beta-cell toxicity and T-cell-dependent immune reactions. The target molecule(s) of MLD-STZ-induced beta-cell toxicity are not known, however. In this study, we report that GLUT2 is a target molecule for MLD-STZ toxicity. Ex vivo, a gradual decrement of both GLUT2 protein and mRNA expression was found in pancreatic islets isolated from MLD-STZ-treated C57BL/6 male mice, whereas mRNA expression of beta-actin, glucokinase, and proinsulin remained unaffected. Significant reduction of both GLUT2 protein and mRNA expression was first noted 1 day after the third STZ injection, clearly preceding the onset of hyperglycemia. The extent of reduction increased with the number of STZ injections administered and increased over time, after the last, i.e., fifth, STZ injection. The STZ-induced reduction of GLUT2 protein and mRNA was not due to an essential loss of beta-cells, because ex vivo, not only the total RNA yield and protein content in isolated islets, but also proinsulin mRNA expression, failed to differ significantly in the differently treated groups. Furthermore, islets isolated from MLD-STZ-treated donors responded to the nonglucose secretagogue arginine in a pattern similar to that of solvent-treated donors. Interestingly, the MLD-STZ-induced reduction of both GLUT2 protein and mRNA was prevented by preinjecting mice with 5-thio-D-glucose before each STZ injection. Apparently, GLUT2 is a crucial target molecule of MLD-STZ toxicity, and this toxicity seems to precede the immune reactions against beta-cells.
3002801	Effects of enprofylline on A1 and A2 adenosine receptors.	The effects of enprofylline were studied on A1 adenosine receptors of rat fat cells and on A2 adenosine receptors of human platelets and of guinea-pig lung. Enprofylline antagonized the 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA)-induced stimulation of platelet adenylate cyclase activity with a KB of 130 microM. In human platelets, enprofylline did not antagonize but potentiated the NECA-induced inhibition of aggregation. This potentiation was abolished in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor papaverine. An adenosine antagonistic effect of enprofylline could not be evaluated on A2 receptors of guinea-pig lung because the xanthine enhanced basal and NECA-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation. Enprofylline antagonized the N6-R-(-)-phenylisopropyladenosine (R-PIA)-induced inhibition of rat fat cell adenylate cyclase with a KB of 32 microM. The Ki value for inhibition of [3H]PIA binding to fat cell membranes was 45 microM. Enprofylline inhibited cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activity of human platelets, guinea-pig lung and rat fat cells with Ki values of 15, 130 and 110 microM, respectively. The results show that enprofylline was nearly equipotent as antagonist at A1 and A2 adenosine receptors. Mechanisms other than adenosine antagonism or phosphodiesterase inhibition may be involved in the pharmacological effects of enprofylline.
10601100	The effect of etonogestrel on VEGF, oestrogen and progesterone receptor immunoreactivity and endothelial cell number in human endometrium.	Contraceptive use often leads to disrupted endometrial bleeding patterns in women. In this study, two different contraceptive regimes (Mircette, a monophasic oral contraceptive and Implanon, a long-acting gestagen) were used and their effects on the immunoreactivity of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and endothelial cell number were determined. During the untreated normal cycle, there was a significant increase (P = 0.005) in glandular VEGF immunoreactivity and a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in PR immunoreactivity in the mid- and late secretory phases compared with the proliferative phase. There was a significant positive correlation (gamma = 0.38, P = 0.046) between stromal VEGF immunoreactivity and endothelial cell number. This correlation was also apparent during treatment with Implanon, but not with Mircette. Disrupted bleeding patterns were associated with Implanon and, to a lesser extent, with Mircette. Both contraceptives significantly reduced glandular VEGF immunoreactivity. Implanon significantly increased (P = 0.016) glandular PR staining, but Mircette significantly reduced (P = 0.027) stromal PR staining when compared with secretory before-treatment biopsies. There were no changes in endothelial cell number or glandular or stromal ER during the normal cycle, or with use of either contraceptive. There was no association between the parameters measured with bleeding patterns and histological category.
23419593	Temporal relationship between aquaporin-4 and glial fibrillary acidic protein in cerebellum of neonate and adult rats administered a BBB disrupting spider venom.	Two astrocyte markers, the glial water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4) and the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), have been implicated in several physiological and pathological conditions in the central nervous system (CNS) as well as in blood-brain barrier breakdown (BBBb). By color segmentation the immunoreactivity of both proteins, we demonstrate that the expression of AQP4 and GFAP was increased in the cerebellum of neonate (14-day-old, P14) and adult (8-week-old) rats administered Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom (PNV) known to cause perivascular edema, BBBb and convulsion. In the cerebellum's gray matter, PNV produced a major response, especially in the granular layer. Parallel increases in AQP4 and GFAP expression occurred 24 h after envenomation in the white matter of P14 and in the molecular layer of adults, as well as in the granular layer 2 h after envenomation. In the Purkinje layer there was a tendency of increased AQP4, for both, neonates (5 h), and adults (2 and 24 h). Moreover, PNV also provoked nonparallel upregulation of both markers with prevalence of upregulation of AQP 4 for P14 rats, and GFAP for adults. The major expression of both proteins was in the gray matter. The data indicates a venom effect in water/electrolyte balance in the cerebellum and the participation of AQP4 in these effects. Age-related and time-related regional differences probably reflect specificity in AQP4 distribution in different astrocytic membrane domains as well as its participation in K(+) buffering and neural activity. This study is the first to associate astrocytic AQP4 expression and reactive gliosis in a model of BBB permeability promoted by P. nigriventer venom. Our data provide compelling evidence that AQP4 expression was increased in the cerebellum of rats administered PNV.
15646028	Modification of radiation damage to mitochondrial system in vivo by Podophyllum hexandrum: mechanistic aspects.	The present study was undertaken to investigate whether RP-1 treatment protected mitochondrial system against radiation damage and also to unravel the mechanism associated with this process. Radioprotection of mitochondrial system by Podophyllum hexandrum (RP-1) was investigated to understand its mechanism of action. Levels of superoxide anion (O2-), reduced or oxidized glutathione (GSH or GSSG), thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), protein carbonyl (PC), ATP, NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex-I), NADH-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (complex I/II), succinate-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (complex II/III) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were studied in mitochondria isolated from liver of mice belonging to various treatment groups. Whole body y-irradiation (10 Gy) significantly (p < 0.01) increased the formation of O2-, PC, and TBARS, upto 24 h as compared to untreated control. RP-1 treatment (200 mg/kg b.w.) to mice 2 h before irradiation reduced the radiation-induced O2- generation within 4 h and formation of TBARS and PC upto 24 h significantly (p < 0.01). Singularly irradiation or RP-1 treatment significantly (p < 0.01) increased the levels of glutathione within an hour, as compared to untreated control. Pre-irradiation administration of RP-1 enhanced levels of GSH induced increase in complex I (upto 16 h), complex I/III (4 h) complex II/III activity (upto 24 h; p < 0.01) and inhibited the radiation-induced decrease in MMP significantly (24 h; p < 0.01). The present study indicates that RP-1 itself modulates several mitichondrial perameters due to its influence on the biochemical milieu within and outside the cells. However, RP-1 treatment before irradiation modulates radiation induced perturbations such as the increase in electron transport chain enzyme activity, formation of O2-, TBARS and PC to offer radioprotection.
17223000	The inhibitory effect of the leukotriene receptor antagonist on leukotriene D4-induced MUC2/5AC gene expression and mucin secretion in human airway epithelial cells.	OBJECTIVES: Mucin gene expression and mucin production are markedly increased in inflammatory airway disorders such as asthma, chronic bronchitis and rhinosinusitis. Cytokines, lipopolysaccharides and other inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandin and leukotriene are related to the secretion and production of mucin. However, the relationship of leukotrienes with mucin genes expression is not clear. The aim of this study is to evaluate MUC2/5AC gene expression and mucin secretion by the leukotriene receptor in human airway epithelial cells. METHODS: The effect of leukotriene D(4) and the leukotriene receptor antagonist, pranlukast hydrate (ONO-1078) on the regulation of MUC2/5AC gene expression and mucin secretion were observed in human airway NCI-H292 epithelial cells. The mRNA levels of MUC2/5AC and the amount of mucin were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunoassay. RESULTS: Leukotriene D(4) upregulated MUC2/5AC gene expression and mucin secretion in a dose dependent pattern. Pranlukast hydrate (ONO-1078, 100 microM) downregulated the leukotriene D(4)-induced MUC2/5AC gene expression and mucin secretion. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the leukotriene receptor system is one of the mechanisms related to MUC2/5AC gene expression and mucin secretion in the human airway epithelium.
19203467	Neurochemical effects of the monoamine oxidase inhibitor phenelzine on brain GABA and alanine: A comparison with vigabatrin.	PURPOSE: To compare phenelzine (PLZ), an antidepressant drug with anxiolytic properties which inhibits monoamine oxidase (MAO) but also elevates rat brain levels of the amino acids ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and alanine (ALA), with vigabatrin (VIG), an anticonvulsant which elevates brain GABA by inhibition of GABA transaminase (GABA-T), with regard to their actions on brain levels of GABA and ALA and on activities of MAO, GABA-T and ALA transaminase (ALA-T). METHODS: Male rats were administered PLZ (10 mg/kg) or VIG (1,000 mg/kg) i.p., and the rats were euthanized 4 hours later and the brains removed for analysis of levels of GABA and ALA (by electron capture gas chromatography after derivatization) and activities of MAO, GABA-T and ALA-T (radiochemical assays). RESULTS: Both PLZ and VIG inhibited GABA-T and elevated GABA levels. Only PLZ inhibited MAO and ALA-T and elevated ALA levels. The effects of PLZ on both amino acids and their transaminases were blocked by pre-treatment with the MAO inhibitor tranylcypromine. This pretreament had no effect on the inhibition of GABA-T or the elevation of brain GABA levels produced by VIG. CONCLUSIONS: At the doses studied, PLZ was as effective as VIG at elevating brain GABA levels, but, unlike VIG, also inhibited MAO and ALA-T (and increased brain ALA levels). Pretreatment of rats with the MAO inhibitor tranylcypromine prevented the increase in brain GABA and ALA levels with PLZ, but did not block the effect of VIG on GABA. These observations with tranylcypromine and PLZ support the hypothesis that an active metabolite of PLZ produced by the actions of MAO on this drug plays a major role in its GABA- and ALA-elevating actions.
10667230	Polysulfated heparinoids selectively inactivate heparin-binding angiogenesis factors.	Angiogenesis is a prerequisite for tumor expansion and metastasis. The angiogenic potential of the heparin-binding growth factors acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and basic FGF has been demonstrated in various publications. We studied the inhibitory effects of suramin and the polysulfated heparinoids pentosan polysulfate, dextran sulfate, and fucoidan on the action of FGF. As an experimental model, we used the adrenal cancer cell line SW 13, whose anchorage-independent growth depends on the presence of FGF. The polysulfated heparinoids inhibited FGF-induced growth and binding to the receptor at an IC50 of 0.5-3 micrograms/ml. Suramin inhibited FGF at an IC50 of 100 micrograms/ml. The polysulfated heparinoids exerted no effect on IGF-1 or TGF alpha-related growth. Suramin inhibited the anchorage-independent growth induced by IGF-1 or TGF alpha only at an IC50 of 100 micrograms/ml. Our results indicate that suramin inhibits growth factors in a nonselective way. By contrast, polysulfated heparinoids exert a selective inhibitory effect on heparin binding angiogenesis factors at an IC50, which is 100 times below the IC50 of suramin. Therefore, the administration of polysulfated heparinoids might become a novel approach to tumor therapy based on blocking angiogenesis.
23220616	Hepatic metabolism of sulfur amino acids in db/db mice.	To determine the effect of type-2 diabetes and obesity on the hepatic metabolism of sulfur amino acids, hepatic sulfur amino acid metabolism was determined in db/db mice. Hepatic methionine was markedly decreased in db/db mice, although the hepatic activity of betaine homocysteine methyltransferase was increased. The decrease in hepatic methionine was reflected by decreased sulfur-containing methionine metabolites, including S-adenosylmethionine, homocysteine, cysteine, and hypotaurine in liver and plasma. In contrast, S-adenosylhomocysteine, putrescine, and spermidine were increased in db/db mice. The hepatic level and activity of methionine adenosyltransferase I/III, an S-adenosylmethionine synthesizing enzyme, were significantly increased. These results suggest that increased polyamine synthesis, in conjunction with decreased hepatic methionine levels, is partly responsible for the reduction in hepatic S-adenosylmethionine. Decreased homocysteine in liver and plasma may be attributable to the decrease in hepatic methionine and upregulation of hepatic betaine homocysteine methyltransferase. Glutathione in liver and plasma did not change despite decreased γ-glutamylcysteine ligase activity. The decreased hepatic hypotaurine may be attributable to the downregulation of cysteine dioxygenase. The major finding of this study is that db/db mice exhibited decreases in hepatic methionine and its sulfurcontaining metabolites.
23402841	Hematologic and hepatic responses of the freshwater fish Hoplias malabaricus after saxitoxin exposure.	The bioaccumulation of saxitoxins (STX) in the trophic chain, mainly in freshwater, are not completely known. This work aimed to elucidate the effects of STX on Hoplias malabaricus through trophic bioassay. The fish were fed once every five days with Astyanax sp. before being subjected to an intraperitoneal inoculation with the lysate of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii culture containing 97% STX and 3% by neosaxitoxin and gonyautoxin during 20 days. The animal's liver was assessed using biomarkers as activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and concentrations of reduced glutathione (GSH) and lipoperoxidation (LPO) and protein carbonylation (PCO). In the blood was analyzed the genotoxic and hematological parameters. The hepatosomatic index and the relative condition factor did not show a significant difference between the exposed and control groups. The values of mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration and mean corpuscular hemoglobin increased in the STX group. The hepatic tissue from both groups exhibited a typical pattern that have been already described for most teleost fish. The results suggested the generation of reactive oxygen species, with increased activity of GPx and concentrations of LPO and GSH; whereas the specific activity of SOD decreased. However, no changes were observed in the CAT, PCO, and DNA damage. Although the STX effects are known as neurotoxic, this cyanotoxin caused liver biochemical alterations that can be considered ecologically relevant.
17567465	Role of apoptosis in acetaminophen hepatotoxicity.	Acetaminophen overdose causes liver injury by mechanisms involving glutathione depletion, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. The role of apoptosis in acetaminophen-induced cell killing is still controversial. Here, our aim was to evaluate the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) as a key factor in acetaminophen-induced necrotic and apoptotic killing of primary cultured mouse hepatocytes. Acetaminophen (10 micromol/L) induced necrotic killing in approximately 50% of hepatocytes after 6 h and cyclosporin A (CsA), MPT inhibitor, temporarily decreased necrotic killing after 6 h, but cytoprotection was lost after 16 h. Confocal microscopy revealed mitochondrial depolarization and inner membrane permeabilization at approximately 4.5 h after acetaminophen. CsA delayed these changes indicative of the MPT to about 11 h after acetaminophen. TUNEL labeling and caspase 3 activation also increased after acetaminophen. Fructose (20 mmol/L, an ATP-generating glycolytic substrate) plus glycine (5 mmol/L, a membrane stabilizing amino acid) prevented nearly all necrotic cell killing but paradoxically increased apoptosis. In conclusion, acetaminophen induces the MPT and ATP-depletion-dependent necrosis or caspase-dependent apoptosis as determined, in part, by ATP availability from glycolysis.
16627864	Dobutamine improves liver function after hemorrhagic shock through induction of heme oxygenase-1.	RATIONALE: Induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protects the liver against reperfusion injury after hemorrhagic shock. Previous data suggest that the beta(1)-adrenoceptor agonist dobutamine induces HO-1 in hepatocytes. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the functional significance of dobutamine pretreatment for liver function after hemorrhagic shock in vivo. METHODS: Anesthetized rats received either Ringer's (Vehicle/Shock), 10 microg/kg/min of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor agonist dobutamine (Dob/Shock), or 10 microg/kg/min dobutamine and 500 microg/kg/min of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist esmolol (Dob/Esmolol/Shock) for 6 h. Hemorrhagic shock was induced thereafter (mean arterial pressure, 35 mm Hg for 90 min). Animals were resuscitated with shed blood and Ringer's. In addition, the HO pathway was blocked after dobutamine pretreatment with 10 micromol/kg tin-mesoporphyrin-IX (Dob/SnMP/Shock) or animals received 100 mg/kg of the carbon monoxide donor dichloromethane (DCM/Shock). MEASUREMENTS: Hepatocellular metabolism and liver blood flow were measured by plasma disappearance rate of indocyanine green (PDR(ICG)) as a sensitive marker of liver function. MAIN RESULTS: Pretreatment with dobutamine induced HO-1 in pericentral hepatocytes and improved PDR(ICG) (Vehicle/Shock: 11.7 +/- 8.12%/min vs. Dob/Shock: 19.7 +/- 2.46%/min, p = 0.006). Blockade of the HO pathway after preconditioning and the combined pretreatment with dobutamine and esmolol decreased PDR(ICG) (Dob/SnMP/Shock: 12.6 +/- 4.24%/min, p = 0.011; Dob/Esmolol/Shock: 10.2 +/- 4.34%/min, p = 0.008). Pretreatment with a carbon monoxide donor improved PDR(ICG) (DCM/Shock: 18 +/- 3.19%/min, p = 0.022) compared with Vehicle/Shock. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a beta(1)-adrenoceptor-dependent hepatic up-regulation of HO-1 and a better maintained hepatocellular function after hemorrhagic shock in animals pretreated with dobutamine. The improved hepatocellular function may be in part mediated by carbon monoxide because of up-regulation of HO-1. Pretreatment with dobutamine might be a potential means of pharmacologic preconditioning before ischemia-reperfusion of the liver.
8454631	Differential inhibition of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase (cyclooxygenase) isozymes by aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.	Murine prostaglandin endoperoxide (PGH) synthase-1 and PGH synthase-2 expressed in cos-1 cells were found to be differentially sensitive to inhibition by common nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Aspirin completely inhibited bis-oxygenation of arachidonate by PGH synthase-1; in contrast, aspirin-treated PGH synthase-2 metabolized arachidonate primarily to 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) instead of PGH2. ID50 values were determined for a panel of common NSAIDs by measuring instantaneous inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity using an oxygen electrode. Among common NSAIDs tested, indomethacin, sulindac sulfide, and piroxicam preferentially inhibited PGH synthase-1; ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, and meclofenamate inhibited both enzymes with comparable potencies; and 6-methoxy-2-naphthylacetic acid preferentially inhibited PGH synthase-2. These results demonstrate that the two PGH synthases are pharmacologically distinct and indicate that it may be possible to develop isozyme-specific cyclooxygenase inhibitors useful both for anti-inflammatory therapy and for delineating between the biological roles of the PGH synthase isozymes.
10828060	Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha activators improve insulin sensitivity and reduce adiposity.	Fibrates and glitazones are two classes of drugs currently used in the treatment of dyslipidemia and insulin resistance (IR), respectively. Whereas glitazones are insulin sensitizers acting via activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma subtype, fibrates exert their lipid-lowering activity via PPARalpha. To determine whether PPARalpha activators also improve insulin sensitivity, we measured the capacity of three PPARalpha-selective agonists, fenofibrate, ciprofibrate, and the new compound GW9578, in two rodent models of high fat diet-induced (C57BL/6 mice) or genetic (obese Zucker rats) IR. At doses yielding serum concentrations shown to activate selectively PPARalpha, these compounds markedly lowered hyperinsulinemia and, when present, hyperglycemia in both animal models. This effect relied on the improvement of insulin action on glucose utilization, as indicated by a lower insulin peak in response to intraperitoneal glucose in ciprofibrate-treated IR obese Zucker rats. In addition, fenofibrate treatment prevented high fat diet-induced increase of body weight and adipose tissue mass without influencing caloric intake. The specificity for PPARalpha activation in vivo was demonstrated by marked alterations in the expression of PPARalpha target genes, whereas PPARgamma target gene mRNA levels did not change in treated animals. These results indicate that compounds with a selective PPARalpha activation profile reduce insulin resistance without having adverse effects on body weight and adipose tissue mass in animal models of IR.
23510370	Ectopic Thyroid Tissue in the Adrenal Gland: Report of 2 Cases with Pathogenetic Implications.	Background: Ectopic thyroid tissue is usually found anywhere along the embryonic descent pathway of the medial thyroid anlage from the tongue to the trachea (Wölfler area). However, ectopic thyroid tissue in the adrenal gland (ETTAG) is not easy to understand on the basis of thyroid embryology; because it is so rare, the possibility of metastasis should first be considered. Here, we describe 2 cases of ETTAG with pathogenetic implications and review the literature. Patient findings: Two cases of ETTAG presented as incidental cystic adrenal masses in adult females, one having a congenital hernia of Morgagni. The ETTAG was histologically indistinguishable from normal orthotopic thyroid tissue, and its follicular nature was confirmed by immunohistochemical positivity for thyroglobulin, thyroperoxidase, thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1/Titf-1/Nkx2.1), cytokeratin (CK) AE1/AE3, CK 7, pendrin, human sodium iodide symporter (hNIS), paired box gene 8 (PAX8) and FOXE1 (TTF-2), as well as positivity for the messenger RNA of the thyroglobulin gene by in situ hybridization analysis. No C cells (negativity for calcitonin, cromogranin and synaptophysin) were present. Neither BRAF nor KRAS mutations were detected with real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. Further work-up did not show evidence of thyroid malignancy. Summary: ETTAG is a rare finding, with only 7 cases reported; women are much more frequently affected than men (8:1) and it usually clinically presents in the fifth decade (mean age: 54, range: 38-67) as a cystic adrenal mass incidentally discovered on abdominal ultrasonography and/or in computed tomography images. ETTAG is composed of normal follicular cells without C cells. The expression of some transcription factors (TTF-1, PAX8 and FOXE1) involved in development and/or migration of the medial thyroid anlage is preserved. Coexistence of a congenital hernia of Morgagni in one patient suggests an over-descent of medial thyroid anlage derived cells in its pathogenesis. Conclusion: Although ETTAG pathogenesis remains unknown, the lack of C cells together with the coexistence of a congenital defect of the anterior diaphragm (hernia of Morgagni) in one of our patients could suggest an over-descent of medial thyroid anlagen derived cells in the origin of this heterotopia.
23318726	Butein protects human dental pulp cells from hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative toxicity via Nrf2 pathway-dependent heme oxygenase-1 expressions.	Rhus verniciflua Stokes is a plant that is native to East Asian countries, such as Korea, China, and Japan. Butein, a plant polyphenol, is one of the major active components of R. verniciflua. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), produced via dental adhesive bleaching agents and pulpal disease, can cause oxidative stress. Here, we found that butein possesses cytoprotective effects on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced dental cell death. H2O2 is a representative ROS and causes cell death through necrosis in human dental pulp (HDP) cells. H2O2-induced cytotoxicity and production of ROS were blocked in the presence of butein, and these effects were dose dependent. Butein also increased heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein expression and HO activity. In addition, butein-dependent HO-1 expression was required for the inhibition of H2O2-induced cell death and ROS generation. Furthermore, butein treatment caused nuclear accumulation of nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and increased the promoter activity of antioxidant response elements (AREs). Treatment of HDP cells with a c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor also reduced butein-induced HO-1 expression, and butein treatment led to increased JNK phosphorylation. These results indicate that butein may be used to prevent functional dental cell death and thus may be useful as a pulpal disease agent.
23624423	4-Hydroxytamoxifen-stimulated processing of cyclin E is mediated via G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30) and accompanied by enhanced migration in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.	Over-expression of cleaved cyclin E in breast tumors is closely associated with tumor progression and resistance to antiestrogens. 17β-Estradiol (E2) has been recently shown to induce cyclin E processing in breast cancer cells. Tamoxifen has been used in patients with estrogen-sensitive breast cancer, yet resistance to antiestrogens and recurrence will appear in some of the patients after its continued use. We therefore addressed possible effects of tamoxifen on the generation of cleaved cyclin E and its signal mechanism(s) in estrogen-responsive MCF-7 breast cancer cells that express both G protein-coupled protein (GPR) 30 and estrogen receptor α (ERα). 4-Hydroxytamoxifen (OHT, tamoxifen's active form) failed to prevent E2-induced proteolysis of cyclin E and migration, but rather triggered cyclin E cleavage coincident with augmented migration. OHT-induced cyclin E truncation also occurred in SK-BR-3 cells that express GPR30 and lack ERα, but not in MDA-MB-231 cells that express neither GPR30 nor ERα. G1, a specific GPR 30 agonist, caused dramatic proteolysis of cyclin E and enhanced migration. Furthermore, OHT-stimulated cleavage of cyclin E and migration were tremendously attenuated by G15, a GPR30 antagonist, or siRNA against GPR30. In addition, inhibitors for EGFR or ERK1/2 remarkably suppressed OHT-induced truncation of cyclin E, suggesting involvement of EGFR signaling. Collectively, our data indicate that OHT contributes to the production of proteolyzed cyclin E via GPR30 with augmented migration in MCF-7 cells.
23537005	Biotransformation of 2,2',4,4'-Tetrabromodiphenyl Ether (BDE-47) by Human Liver Microsomes: Identification of Cytochrome P450 2B6 as the Major Enzyme Involved.	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were widely used flame retardants that have become persistent environmental pollutants. In the present study, we investigated the in vitro oxidative metabolism of 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), a major PBDE detected in human tissue and environmental samples. Biotransformation of BDE-47 by pooled and individual human liver microsomes and by human recombinant cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes was assessed using a liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry-based method. Of the nine hydroxylated metabolites of BDE-47 produced by human liver microsomes, seven metabolites were identified using authentic standards. A monohydroxy-tetrabrominated and a dihydroxy-tetrabrominated metabolite remain unidentified. Kinetic analysis of the rates of metabolite formation revealed that the major metabolites were 5-hydroxy-2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (5-OH-BDE-47), 6-hydroxy-2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (6-OH-BDE-47), and possibly the unidentified monohydroxy-tetrabrominated metabolite. Among the human recombinant P450 enzymes tested, P450 2B6 was the most active enzyme in the formation of the hydroxylated metabolites of BDE-47. Moreover, the formation of all metabolites of BDE-47 by pooled human liver microsomes was inhibited by a P450 2B6-specific antibody and was highly correlated with P450 2B6-mediated activity in single donor liver microsomes indicating that P450 2B6 was the major P450 responsible for the biotransformation of BDE-47. Additional experiments involving the incubation of liver microsomes with individual monohydroxy-tetrabrominated metabolites in place of BDE-47 demonstrated that 2,4-dibromophenol was a product of BDE-47 and several primary metabolites, but the dihydroxy-tetrabrominated metabolite was not formed by sequential hydroxylation of any of the monohydroxy-tetrabrominated metabolites tested. The present study provides a comprehensive characterization of the oxidative metabolism of BDE-47 by human liver microsomes and P450 2B6.
9732824	Medical therapy and quality of life.	The risk of mortality and long-term morbidity, including loss of sexual function, associated with surgical procedures for symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) has prompted research into alternative medical therapies. Phytotherapy involves the use of herbal formulations, where the mechanisms of action are usually obscure and although studies have confirmed their effectiveness in symptom relief and improving quality of life (QOL), few placebo-controlled trials exist. Both the 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor finasteride and alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists (e.g. alfuzosin, doxazosin, prazosin, tamsulosin and terazosin) have been recommended as appropriate treatment options for patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with benign prostatic obstruction (BPO), and their efficacy has been proven in several placebo-controlled trials. Finasteride reduces the static component of BPO--by reducing the size of the prostate--and, as a result, symptom relief is slow (6-12 months) and is predominantly restricted to patients with large prostates (> 40 g). The alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists, on the other hand, reduce the dynamic component of obstruction--relaxation of smooth muscle in the prostate, urethra and bladder neck--and provide rapid symptom relief after only a few doses, relieving LUTS more effectively than finasteride and irrespective of prostate size. All of the various alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists provide effective and comparable relief of LUTS, and an improvement in bothersomeness and symptom-related QOL. However, it is also important that the therapy is fast acting and acceptable to the patient, in that it does not interfere with other medication or produce unpleasant side effects. These documented properties of the alpha 1A-adrenoceptor antagonists make them an ideal choice for the medical treatment of symptomatic BPH.
10200320	Cyclopentenone prostaglandins suppress activation of microglia: down-regulation of inducible nitric-oxide synthase by 15-deoxy-Delta12,14-prostaglandin J2.	Mechanisms leading to down-regulation of activated microglia and astrocytes are poorly understood, in spite of the potentially detrimental role of activated glia in neurodegeneration. Prostaglandins, produced both by neurons and glia, may serve as mediators of glial and neuronal functions. We examined the influence of cyclopentenone prostaglandins and their precursors on activated glia. As models of glial activation, production of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) was studied in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated rat microglia, a murine microglial cell line BV-2, and IL-1beta-stimulated rat astrocytes. Cyclopentenone prostaglandins were potent inhibitors of iNOS induction and were more effective than their precursors, prostaglandins E2 and D2. 15-Deoxy-Delta12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) was the most potent prostaglandin among those tested. In activated microglia, 15d-PGJ2 suppressed iNOS promoter activity, iNOS mRNA, and protein levels. The action of 15d-PGJ2 does not appear to involve its nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) because troglitazone, a specific ligand of PPARgamma, was unable to inhibit iNOS induction, and neither troglitazone nor 15d-PGJ2 could stimulate the activity of a PPAR-dependent promoter in the absence of cotransfected PPARgamma. 15d-PGJ2 did not block nuclear translocation or DNA-binding activity of the transcription factor NFkappaB, but it did inhibit the activity of an NFkappaB reporter construct, suggesting that the mechanism of suppression of microglial iNOS by 15d-PGJ2 may involve interference with NFkappaB transcriptional activity in the nucleus. Thus, our data suggest the existence of a novel pathway mediated by cyclopentenone prostaglandins, which may represent part of a feedback mechanism leading to the cessation of inflammatory glial responses in the brain.
23353748	Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of novel hybrid compounds of imidazole scaffold-based 2-benzylbenzofuran as potent anticancer agents.	A series of novel hybrid compounds between 2-benzylbenzofuran and imidazole has been prepared and evaluated in vitro against a panel of human tumor cell lines. The results suggest that the existence of benzimidazole ring and substitution of the imidazolyl-3-position with a naphthylacyl or 4-methoxyphenacyl group were vital for modulating cytotoxic activity. In particular, hybrid compounds 46 and 47 were found to be the most potent derivatives against 5 strains human tumor cell lines and more active than cisplatin (DDP), and exhibited cytotoxic activities selectively against breast carcinoma (MCF-7) and myeloid liver carcinoma (SMMC-7721), respectively.
16730121	Effect of ramelteon (TAK-375), a selective MT1/MT2 receptor agonist, on motor performance in mice.	Effect of (S)-N-[2-(1,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2H-indeno-[5,4-b]furan-8-yl)ethyl]propionamide (ramelteon, TAK-375), a selective MT1/MT2 receptor agonist, on motor coordination was studied using rota-rod performance in mice. Ramelteon did not impair rota-rod performance at doses of 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg, p.o. Melatonin and N-acetyl-5-hydroxytryptamine (N-acetyl-5-HT), a ligand of MT3 biding site, also had no impairment on the performance, per se. However, in combination with a low dose of diazepam (3mg/kg, p.o.), treatment with melatonin and N-acetyl-5-HT exacerbated the impairment by diazepam. Ramelteon had no significant effect on the diazepam-induced impairment of motor coordination.
23422733	Co-extrusion as manufacturing technique for multilayer mini-matrices with dual drug release.	The aim of this work was to develop by means of co-extrusion a multilayered dosage form characterized by a dual release profile of the same drug. Co-extrudates consisted of two concentric polymer matrices: a core having a lipophilic character and a coat with a hydrophilic character. Diclofenac sodium (DS) was incorporated as model drug in both layers. Several polymers were screened on the basis of their processability via hot melt extrusion (HME) and in vitro drug release. Polymer combinations with suitable properties (i.e., similar extrusion temperature, appropriate drug release profile) were processed via co-extrusion. (Co-) extruded samples were characterized in terms of solid state (XRD, SEM), in vitro drug release, core/coat adhesion, and bioavailability. Based on the polymer screening, two polymer combinations were selected for co-extrusion: ethylcellulose (core) combined with Soluplus® (coat) and polycaprolactone (core) with PEO (coat). These combinations were successfully co-extruded. XRD revealed that DS remained crystalline during extrusion in ethylcellulose, Soluplus®, polycaprolactone, and PEO. The polycaprolactone/PEO combination could be processed at a lower temperature (70°C), vs. 140°C for ethylcellulose/Soluplus®. The maximum drug load in core and coat depended on the extrusion temperature and the die dimensions, while adhesion between core and coat was mainly determined by the drug load and by the extrusion temperature. In vitro drug release from the co-extruded formulations was reflected in the in vivo behavior: formulations with a higher DS content in the coat (i.e., faster drug release) resulted in higher Cmax and higher AUC values. Co-extrusion is a viable method to produce in a single step a multilayer dosage form with dual drug release.
17082235	Sulfonylureas and glinides exhibit peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma activity: a combined virtual screening and biological assay approach.	Most drugs currently employed in the treatment of type 2 diabetes either target the sulfonylurea receptor stimulating insulin release (sulfonylureas, glinides), or target the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARgamma) improving insulin resistance (thiazolidinediones). Our work shows that sulfonylureas and glinides additionally bind to PPARgamma and exhibit PPARgamma agonistic activity. This activity was predicted in silico by virtual screening and confirmed in vitro in a binding assay, a transactivation assay, and by measuring the expression of PPARgamma target genes. Among the measured compounds, gliquidone and glipizide (two sulfonylureas), as well as nateglinide (a glinide), exhibit PPARgamma agonistic activity at concentrations comparable with those reached under pharmacological treatment. The most active of these compounds, gliquidone, is shown to be as potent as pioglitazone at inducing PPARgamma target gene expression. This dual mode of action of sulfonylureas and glinides may open new perspectives for the molecular pharmacology of antidiabetic drugs, because it provides evidence that drugs can be designed that target both the sulfonylurea receptor and PPARgamma. Targeting both receptors could increase pancreatic insulin secretion and improve insulin resistance. Glinides, sulfonylureas, and other acidified sulfonamides may be promising leads in the development of new PPARgamma agonists. In addition, we provide a unified concept of the PPARgamma binding ability of seemingly disparate compound classes.
23159887	Expression of cAMP-responsive element binding proteins (CREBs) in fast- and slow-twitch muscles: A signaling pathway to account for the synaptic expression of collagen-tailed subunit (ColQ) of acetylcholinesterase at the rat neuromuscular junction.	The gene encoding the collagen-tailed subunit (ColQ) of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) contains two distinct promoters that drive the production of two ColQ mRNAs, ColQ-1 and ColQ-1a, in slow- and fast-twitch muscles, respectively. ColQ-1a is expressed at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in fast-twitch muscle, and this expression depends on trophic factors supplied by motor neurons signaling via a cAMP-dependent pathway in muscle. To further elucidate the molecular basis of ColQ-1a's synaptic expression, here we investigated the expression and localization of cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) at the synaptic and extra-synaptic regions of fast- and slow-twitch muscles from adult rats. The total amount of active, phosphorylated CREB (P-CREB) present in slow-twitch soleus muscle was higher than that in fast-twitch tibialis muscle, but P-CREB was predominantly expressed in the fast-twitch muscle at NMJs. In contrast, P-CREB was detected in both synaptic and extra-synaptic regions of slow-twitch muscle. These results reveal, for the first time, the differential distribution of P-CREB in fast- and slow-twitch muscles, which might support the crucial role of cAMP-dependent signaling in controlling the synapse-specific expression of ColQ-1a in fast-twitch muscles.
23142538	Effect of developmental dioxin exposure on methylation and expression of specific imprinted genes in mice.	2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is an endocrine disruptor affecting the reproductive system in humans. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of TCDD administered to pregnant mice at two different doses (2-10 ng/kg/day), on imprinted genes in the male offspring. The degree of methylation and the mRNA expression of Snrpn, Peg3 and Igf2r were analyzed in the sperm, skeletal muscle and liver. TCDD administration (10 ng/kg/day) decreased the sperm count in the male offspring. It did not affect methylation but increased mRNA expression of Snrpn, Peg3, Igf2r and Air ncRNA. In muscle and liver, TCDD (10 ng/kg/day) induced increases in methylation and decreases in mRNA expression of Igf2r. These results show that the robust effects of TCDD on the mRNA expression of Snrpn, Peg3 and Igf2r genes in the sperm and of Igf2r in the muscle and liver are unrelated to changes in methylation in their respective genes.
23631463	Design, Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Aminoalkylindole Derivatives as Cannabinoid Receptor Ligands with Potential for Treatment of Alcohol Abuse.	Attenuation of increased endocannabinoid signaling with a CB1R neutral antagonist might offer a new therapeutic direction for treatment of alcohol abuse. We have recently reported that a mono-hydroxylated metabolite of the synthetic aminoalkylindole cannabinoid JHW-073 (3) exhibits neutral antagonist activity at CB1Rs and thus may serve as a promising lead for the development of novel alcohol abuse therapies. In the current study, we show that systematic modification of an aminoalkylindole scaffold identifies two new compounds with dual CB1R antagonist/CB2R agonist activity. Similar to the CB1R antagonist/inverse agonist rimonabant, analogues 27 and 30 decrease oral alcohol self-administration, without affecting total fluid intake and block the development of alcohol-conditioned place preference. Collectively, these initial findings suggest that design and systematic modification of aminoalkylindoles such as 3 may lead to development of novel cannabinoid ligands with dual CB1R antagonist/CB2R agonist activity with potential for use as treatments of alcohol abuse.
11350858	Short- and long-term influences of calcitonin gene-related peptide on the synthesis of acetylcholinesterase in mammalian myotubes.	The present study analyses the short- (15 min - 2 h) and long-term (24 - 48 h) influences of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) expression in the rat cultured skeletal muscle and the signal transduction events underlying CGRP actions. To assess the effect of CGRP on AChE synthesis, myotubes were pre-exposed to the irreversible AChE inhibitor diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) and treated with CGRP or forskolin, an adenylyl cyclase (AC) activator. Treatment of myotubes with 1 - 100 nM CGRP for 2 h increased by up to 42% the synthesis of catalytically active AChE with a parallel increase in the intracellular cyclic AMP. The stimulation of AChE synthesis induced by CGRP was mimicked by direct activation of AC with 3 - 30 microM forskolin. In contrast, pre-treatment of cultures with 100 nM CGRP for 20 h reduced by 37% the subsequent synthesis of AChE, resulting in a 15% decrease in total AChE activity after 48 h CGRP treatment. Moreover, 24 h treatment of myotubes with 100 nM CGRP reduced by 54% the accumulation of cyclic AMP induced by a subsequent CGRP treatment. These findings indicate that, in skeletal muscle cells, CGRP modulates the AChE expression in a time-dependent manner, initially stimulating the enzyme synthesis through a cyclic AMP-dependent mechanism. The decreased AChE synthesis observed after long-term CGRP treatment suggests that CGRP signalling system is subject to desensitization or down-regulation, that might function as an important adaptative mechanism of the muscle fibre in response to long-term changes in neuromuscular transmission.
16997906	Functional classification of amino acid decarboxylases from the alanine racemase structural family by phylogenetic studies.	Arginine decarboxylase (ADC) and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) are involved in the biosynthesis of putrescine, which is the precursor of other polyamines in animals, plants, and bacteria. These pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-dependent decarboxylases belong to the alanine racemase (AR) structural family together with diaminopimelate decarboxylase (DapDC), which catalyzes the final step of lysine biosynthesis in bacteria. We have constructed a multiple-sequence alignment of decarboxylases in the AR structural family and, based on the alignment, inferred phylogenetic trees. The phylogenetic tree consists of 3 distinct clades formed by ADC, DapDC, and ODC that diverged from an ancestral decarboxylase. The ancestral decarboxylase probably was able to recognize several substrates, and in archaea and bacteria, ODC may have retained the ability to bind other amino acids. Previously, a paralogue of ODC has been proposed to account for ADC activity detected in mammalian cells. According to our results, this appears unlikely, emphasizing the need for more caution in functional assignment made using sequence data and illustrating the continuing value of phylogenetic analysis in clarifying relationships and putative functions.
21600945	Cigarette smoke-induced kinin B1 receptor promotes NADPH oxidase activity in cultured human alveolar epithelial cells.	Pulmonary inflammation is an important pathological feature of tobacco smoke-related lung diseases. Kinin B1 receptor (B1R) is up-regulated in the rat trachea chronically exposed to cigarette-smoke. This study aimed at determining (1) whether exposure to total particulate matter of the cigarette smoke (TPM) can induce B1R in human alveolar epithelial A549 cells, (2) the mechanism of B1R induction, (3) the functionality of de novo synthesized B1R, and (4) the role of B1R in TPM-induced increase of superoxide anion (O(2)((-))) level. Results show that A549 cells exposed to 10 mug/ml TPM increased O(2)((-)) level along with B1R (protein and mRNA) and IL-1beta mRNA. In contrast, B2R and TNF-alpha mRNA were not affected by TPM. The increasing effect of TPM on O(2)((-)) level was not significantly affected by the B1R antagonist SSR240612. TPM-increased B1R mRNA was prevented by co-treatments with N-acetyl-l-cysteine (potent antioxidant), diphenyleneiodonium (NADPH oxidase inhibitor), IL-1Ra (interleukin-1R antagonist) and SN-50 (specific inhibitor of NF-kB activation) but not by pentoxifylline (TNF-alpha release inhibitor), indomethacin and niflumic acid (COX-1 and -2 inhibitors). Stimulation of B1R with a selective agonist (des-Arg(9)-BK, 10 muM; 30 min) increased O(2)((-))production which was prevented by apocynin and diphenyleneiodonium (NADPH oxidase inhibitors). Data suggest that the increased expression of B1R by TPM in A549 cells is mediated by oxidative stress, IL-1beta and NF-kB but not by cyclooxygenases or TNF-alpha. The amplification of O(2)((-)) levels via the activation of B1R-NADPH oxidase may exacerbate pulmonary inflammation and contribute to the chronicity of tobacco smoke-related lung diseases.
23159790	Purification and structural characterisation of phospholipase A1 (Vespapase, Ves a 1) from Thai banded tiger wasp (Vespa affinis) venom.	The Thai banded tiger wasp (Vespa affinis) is one of the most dangerous vespid species in Southeast Asia, and stinging accidents involving this species still cause fatalities. In the present study, four forms of V. affinis phospholipase A(1) were identified through a proteomics approach. Two of these enzymes were purified by reverse-phase chromatography, and their biochemical properties were characterised. These enzymes, designated Ves a 1s, are not glycoproteins and exist as 33441.5 and 33474.4 Da proteins, which corresponded with the 34-kDa band observed via SDS-PAGE. The thermal stabilities of these enzymes were stronger than snake venom. Using an in vivo assay, no difference was found in the toxicities of the different isoforms. Furthermore, the toxicity of these enzymes does not appear to be correlated with their PLA(1) activity. The cDNAs of the full-length version of Ves a 1s revealed that the Ves a 1 gene consists of a 1005-bp ORF, which encodes 334 amino acid residues, and 67- and 227-bp 5' and 3' UTRs, respectively. The two isoforms are different by three nucleotide substitutions, resulting in the replacement of two amino acids. Through sequence alignment, these enzymes were classified as members of the pancreatic lipase family. The structural modelling of Ves a 1 used the rat pancreatic lipase-related protein 2 (1bu8A) as a template because it has PLA(1) activity, which demonstrated that this enzyme belongs to the α/β hydrolase fold family. The Ves a 1 structure, which is composed of seven α-helixes and eleven β-strands, contains the β-strand/ɛSer/α-helix structural motif, which contains the Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly consensus sequence. The typical surface structures that play important roles in substrate selectivity (the lid domain and the β9 loop) were shortened in the Ves a 1 structure, which suggests that this enzyme may only exhibit phospholipase activity. Moreover, the observed insertion of proline into the lid domain of the Ves a 1 structure is rare. We therefore propose that this proline residue might be involved in the stability and activity of Ves a 1s.
23403092	The food contaminant deoxynivalenol activates the mitogen activated protein kinases in the intestine: interest of ex vivo models as an alternative to in vivo experiments.	Trichothecenes induce changes in the intestinal barrier function through decreased expression of cell junction proteins and apoptosis of enterocytes. The mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) play an important role in the signaling pathways of cell turnover and differentiation. Using ex vivo and in vivo approaches, the purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of low doses of DON to induce histological changes in the intestine and to activate the MAPK ERK 1/2, p38 and JNK. Twelve weaning piglets received during four weeks a control diet or a DON-contaminated diet (2.3 mg DON/kg feed). Six weaning piglets were used to prepare jejunal explants (ex vivo model). Explants were exposed during 4 h to vehicle, 5 or 10 μM DON. Intestinal changes were graded using a histological score. Pigs fed a DON-diet and explants exposed to DON showed a significant decrease in the jejunal score. In both models, the toxin significantly enhanced phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 and p38, whereas the increased phosphorylation of JNK was non significant. Taken together these results indicate that in vivo or ex vivo exposure of intestinal tissue to DON lead to similar intestinal lesions and activation of MAPK. These effects could impair the homeostasis of intestinal tissue in the aspects of barrier function and immune protection. The similarity of the in vivo and ex vivo results provides also strong evidence that the jejunal explant model is a good alternative for toxicological studies in intestinal tissue.
15762869	Inhibitory oligodeoxynucleotides - therapeutic promise for systemic autoimmune diseases?	Recent studies have shed new light on a possible link between the innate activation of plasmocytoid dendritic cells and marginal zone B cells and the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus. Animal studies have identified that this response requires the Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9). Engagement of the TLR9 by various ligands, including non-canonical CpG-motifs, can cause or aggravate pathogenic autoantibody production and cytokine secretion in lupus. Attempts to neutralize this activity either by blocking the acidification of the endosomal compartment with chloroquine and related compounds, or by preventing the interaction between the CpG-DNA sequences and TLR9 using inhibitory oligonucleotides could be a promising therapeutic option for lupus.
23159329	Distinct roles of methamphetamine in modulating spatial memory consolidation, retrieval, reconsolidation and the accompanying changes of ERK and CREB activation in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.	Drugs of abuse modulated learning and memory in humans yet the underlying mechanism remained unclear. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) were involved in neuroplastic changes associated with learning and memory. In the current study, we used a Morris water maze to examine the effect of methamphetamine (METH) on different processes of spatial memory in mice. We then investigated the status of ERK and CREB in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC). We found that 1.0 mg/kg dose of METH facilitated spatial memory consolidation when it was injected immediately after the last learning trial. In contrast, the same dose of METH had no effect on spatial memory retrieval when it was injected 30 min before the test. Furthermore, 1.0 mg/kg dose of METH injected immediately after retrieval had no effect on spatial memory reconsolidation. Activation of both ERK and CREB in the hippocampus was found following memory consolidation but not after retrieval or reconsolidation in METH-treated mouse groups. In contrast, activation of both ERK and CREB in the PFC was found following memory retrieval but not other processes in METH-treated mouse groups. These results suggested that METH facilitated spatial memory consolidation but not retrieval or reconsolidation. Moreover, activation of the ERK and CREB signaling pathway in the hippocampus might be involved in METH-induced spatial memory changes.
19753124	Long-term efficacy and safety of anastrozole for adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer in postmenopausal women.	For more than 20 years, tamoxifen has been the gold standard for the adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone-responsive early breast cancer. However, recent randomized trials have shown efficacy and tolerability benefits with the third-generation aromatase inhibitor anastrozole, resulting in an increased use of this agent in the adjuvant setting. Data on anastrozole's long-term efficacy and tolerability are therefore of interest in clinical practice and will be reviewed here, especially in the light of the 100-month analysis of the ATAC (Anastrozole, Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination) trial.
8861551	Muromonab CD3: a reappraisal of its pharmacology and use as prophylaxis of solid organ transplant rejection.	The murine monoclonal antibody muromonab CD3 (OKT3) is directed against the CD3 antigen on peripheral human T cells and effectively blocks all T cell function. Prophylaxis with muromonab CD3 (5mg intravenously once daily for 10 to 14 days) as induction therapy together with corticosteroids, azathioprine and delayed cyclosporin (sequential therapy) optimises early graft function by delaying the potentially nephrotoxic and hepatotoxic effects of cyclosporin until graft function is established. Although clinical data are limited (by inconsistencies in trial design and trial size), prophylactic muromonab CD3-based sequential therapy is significantly more effective than standard triple therapy in the prophylaxis of allograft rejection in renal and hepatic, but not cardiac, transplant recipients. Benefits are particularly notable in patients with delayed graft function. No significant between-treatment differences in patient survival have been observed. The overall efficacy of muromonab CD3- and polyclonal-based prophylactic regimens appears to be similar, although results vary between investigators and confirmation is needed. An anti-interleukin-2 monoclonal antibody-based prophylactic regimen improved graft and patient survival compared with muromonab CD3-based prophylaxis in hepatic transplant recipients. Antimuromonab CD3 antibodies may develop; however, muromonab CD3 may be successfully reused in patients with low titres. Preliminary pharmacoeconomic data suggest that mean drug costs are greater with quadruple immunosuppressive regimens containing muromonab CD3, antithymocyte globulin (ATG) or antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) than with triple therapy. Drug costs with prophylactic muromonab CD3-based regimens were similar or greater than those with polyclonal-based protocols. The first doses of muromonab CD3 are associated with the 'cytokine-release syndrome'. More severe first-dose events include aseptic meningitis, intragraft thromboses, seizures and potentially fatal pulmonary oedema. The incidence and/or severity of cytomegalovirus infection with prophylactic muromonab CD3 based immunosuppression is similar to or greater than that with triple therapy and ATG- or ALG-based regimens. However, the risk of infection and also the observed increase in lymphoproliferative disorders appears to be related to the degree of immunosuppression rather than to the drug itself Thus, sequential muromonab CD3-based therapy is more effective than standard triple therapy (in renal and hepatic transplant recipients) and appears to be similar to that of polyclonal-based regimens in the prophylaxis of transplant rejection. Although the routine use of prophylactic muromonab CD3 in low-risk patients with primary graft function does not appear to be justified, prophylactic muromonab CD3-based therapy has a role in patients at high risk of rejection.
23566514	Discovery and synthesis of novel 4-aminopyrrolopyrimidine Tie-2 kinase inhibitors for the treatment of solid tumors.	The synthesis and biological evaluation of novel Tie-2 kinase inhibitors are presented. Based on the pyrrolopyrimidine chemotype, several new series are described, including the benzimidazole series by linking a benzimidazole to the C5-position of the 4-amino-pyrrolopyrimidine core and the ketophenyl series synthesized by incorporating a ketophenyl group to the C5-position. Medicinal chemistry efforts led to potent Tie-2 inhibitors. Compound 15, a ketophenyl pyrrolopyrimidine urea analog with improved physicochemical properties, demonstrated favorable in vitro attributes as well as dose responsive and robust oral tumor growth inhibition in animal models.
22450748	P21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4) is required for metaphase spindle positioning and anchoring.	The oncogenic kinase PAK4 was recently found to be involved in the regulation of the G1 phase and the G2/M transition of the cell cycle. We have also identified that PAK4 regulates Ran GTPase activity during mitosis. Here, we show that after entering mitosis, PAK4-depleted cells maintain a prolonged metaphase-like state. In these cells, chromosome congression to the metaphase plate occurs with normal kinetics but is followed by an extended period during which membrane blebbing and spindle rotation are observed. These bipolar PAK4-depleted metaphase-like spindles have a defective astral microtubule (MT) network and are not centered in the cell but are in close contact with the cell cortex. As the metaphase-like state persists, centrosome fragmentation occurs, chromosomes scatter from the metaphase plate and move toward the spindle poles with an active spindle assembly checkpoint, a phenotype that is reminiscent of cohesion fatigue. PAK4 also regulates the acto-myosin cytoskeleton and we report that PAK4 depletion results in the induction of cortical membrane blebbing during prometaphase arrest. However, we show that membrane blebs, which are strongly enriched in phospho-cofilin, are not responsible for the poor anchoring of the spindle. As PAK4 depletion interferes with the localization of components of the dynein/dynactin complexes at the kinetochores and on the astral MTs, we propose that loss of PAK4 could induce a change in the activities of motor proteins.
23134735	Development and validation of a high-throughput intrinsic ATPase activity assay for the discovery of MEKK2 inhibitors.	The kinase MEKK2 (MAP3K2) has recently been implicated in tumor growth and metastasis. Thus, selective inhibition of MEKK2 may be a novel strategy for cancer therapy. To identify inhibitors of MEKK2 kinase activity, we have developed a novel activity assay for MEKK2 based on the discovery that recombinant purified MEKK2 has intrinsic ATPase activity. This MEKK2 ATPase assay was validated for enzyme identity and enzymatic purity by multiple methods including mass spectrometry analysis, testing different sources of MEKK2 and comparing ATPase assay IC50 data for multiple inhibitors to literature values and to IC50 data generated using MEKK2 binding and transphosphorylation assays. Taken together, these data indicated that genuine MEKK2 activity was being measured in this assay and no other ATPases contributed to the signal. A miniaturized version of the assay was validated for high-throughput screening, and compound libraries were screened. The screening hits generated comparable potencies in the MEKK2 intrinsic ATPase, binding, and transphosphorylation assays. We identified a novel MEKK2 inhibitor and confirmed that crizotinib and bosutinib are potent in vitro inhibitors of MEKK2 activity with IC50 values of <100 nM. Thus, this assay has utility for the discovery of small-molecule inhibitors of MEKK2 activity.
23416003	Design and synthesis of bicyclic pyrazinone and pyrimidinone amides as potent TF-FVIIa inhibitors.	Bicyclic pyrazinone and pyrimidinone amides were designed and synthesized as potent TF-FVIIa inhibitors. SAR demonstrated that the S2 and S3 pockets of FVIIa prefer to bind small, lipophilic groups. An X-ray crystal structure of optimized compound 9b bound in the active site of FVIIa showed that the bicyclic scaffold provides 5 hydrogen bonding interactions in addition to projecting groups for interactions within the S1, S2 and S3 pockets. Compound 9b showed excellent FVIIa potency, good selectivity against FIXa, Xa, XIa and chymotrypsin, and good clotting activity.
23501055	Gambogic acid inhibits angiogenesis through inhibiting PHD2-VHL-HIF-1α pathway.	Our previous studies revealed that gambogic acid (GA), the major active ingredient of gamboge, possessed antiangiogenic activities. In this study, we further explored the mechanism of inhibition effects of GA in tumor angiogenesis. The results of luciferase, RT-PCR, and ELISA assays indicated that GA significantly decreased transcription activation, mRNA expression, and secretion of VEGF in hypoxia. We detected that GA had no effect on mRNA level of HIF-1α which targets VEGF gene, but the increase of HIF-1α protein expression in hypoxia was repressed by GA, which can be reversed by proteasomal inhibitor MG132 and siRNA of VHL. But GA exhibited no effect on expression of VHL both in normoxia and hypoxia. HIF prolyl hydroxylases (PHD enzymes) act as oxygen sensors regulating HIF, and hence angiogenesis. Our results showed that GA potentially enhanced level of PHD2, the most important HIF hydroxylase, and showed no effect on PHD1 and PHD3. Transient transfection of siRNA of PHD2 could eliminate GA-induced VEGF secretion increase. Growth of HepG2 xenografts in BALB/cA nude mice was inhibited by GA and angiogenesis was repressed significantly in tumor xenografts by immunohistochemical staining of CD-31, a vascular endothelial marker, accompanied with decrease of HIF-1α and increase of PHD2 expression in tissue extracts. This work provides the demonstration that GA shows anti-angiogenic effects via inhibiting PHD2-VHL-HIF-1α pathway.
23645677	Gain-of-function mutations in transient receptor potential C6 (TRPC6) activate extracellular-signal-regulated kinases Erk1/2.	Gain-of-function mutations in the canonical transient receptor potential 6 (TRPC6) gene are a cause of autosomal dominant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS4). The mechanisms whereby abnormal TRPC6 activity results in proteinuria remain unknown. The Erk1/2 MAP kinases are activated in glomeruli and podocytes in several proteinuric disease models. We therefore examined whether FSGS-associated mutations in TRPC6 result in activation of these kinases. In 293T cells and cultured podocytes, overexpression of gain-of-function TRPC6 mutants resulted in increased Erk1/2 phosphorylation, an effect dependent upon channel function. Pharmacologic inhibitor studies implicated several signaling mediators, including calmodulin and calcineurin, supporting the importance of TRPC6-mediated calcium influx in this process. Through media transfer experiments, we uncovered two distinct mechanisms for Erk activation by mutant TRPC6, a cell autonomous, EGFR-independent mechanism and a cell non-autonomous mechanism involving metalloprotease-mediated release of a presumed EGFR ligand. The inhibitors KN-92 and H89 were able to block both pathways in mutant TRPC6 expressing cells, as well as the prolonged elevation of intracellular calcium levels upon carbachol stimulation seen in these cells. However, these effects appear independent of their effects on CaMKII and PKA, respectively. Phosphorylation of T70, S282 and Y31/Y285 were not necessary for Erk activation by mutant TRPC6, though a phosphomimetic TRPC6 S282E mutant was capable of Erk activation. Taken together, these results identify two pathways downstream of mutant TRPC6 leading to Erk activation that may play a role in the development of FSGS.
23623843	Protective effects of Keemun black tea polysaccharides on acute carbon tetrachloride-caused oxidative hepatotoxicity in mice.	This study was designed to investigate chemical characterization of the water-soluble polysaccharides extracted from Keemun black tea (KBTP), and their antioxidant and hepatoprotective effects against CCl4-induced oxidative damage in mice. HPLC analysis revealed that KBTP is the typical acidic heteropolysaccharides and consisted of nine monosaccharides. Furthermore, KBTP showed highly ferric-reducing antioxidant power and scavenging effects against DPPH, OH and O2(-) in vitro. Administration of KBTP (200, 400 and 800mg/kgbw) in mice ahead of CCl4 injection could observably antagonize the CCl4-induced increases in serum ALT, AST, TG and TC, and the hepatic MDA and 8-iso-PGF2a levels, respectively. Mice with KBTP pretreatment displayed a better profile of hepatosomatic index and the improved GSH and SOD activities in comparison with CCl4-intoxicated mice. These biochemical results were further supported with liver histopathological assessment, revealing that KBTP has an observable prevention of liver damage induced by CCl4 in mice.
22634112	cAMP regulation of airway smooth muscle function.	Agonists activating β(2)-adrenoceptors (β(2)ARs) on airway smooth muscle (ASM) are the drug of choice for rescue from acute bronchoconstriction in patients with both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Moreover, the use of long-acting β-agonists combined with inhaled corticosteroids constitutes an important maintenance therapy for these diseases. β-Agonists are effective bronchodilators due primarily to their ability to antagonize ASM contraction. The presumed cellular mechanism of action involves the generation of intracellular cAMP, which in turn can activate the effector molecules cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and Epac. Other agents such as prostaglandin E(2) and phosphodiesterase inhibitors that also increase intracellular cAMP levels in ASM, can also antagonize ASM contraction, and inhibit other ASM functions including proliferation and migration. Therefore, β(2)ARs and cAMP are key players in combating the pathophysiology of airway narrowing and remodeling. However, limitations of β-agonist therapy due to drug tachyphylaxis related to β(2)AR desensitization, and recent findings regarding the manner in which β(2)ARs and cAMP signal, have raised new and interesting questions about these well-studied molecules. In this review we discuss current concepts regarding β(2)ARs and cAMP in the regulation of ASM cell functions and their therapeutic roles in asthma and COPD.
10422661	Synergistic antiallodynic effects of spinal morphine with ketorolac and selective COX1- and COX2-inhibitors in nerve-injured rats.	The possible role of spinal prostanoids in the tactile allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia associated with an experimental model of neuropathic pain was investigated. Neuropathic pain was induced by tight ligation of the L5 and L6 spinal nerves. Tactile allodynia was assessed 7 days after the surgery by measuring hindpaw withdrawal threshold to probing with von Frey filaments. Thermal hyperalgesia and nociception were determined by the 52 degrees C warm-water tail-flick test and by applying radiant heat to the plantar aspect of the hindpaw ipsilateral to the ligation. Minimal antiallodynic effect was produced by intrathecal (i.th.) administration of ketorolac or morphine up to the highest testable dose (100 microg) or by the (R)- or (S)-enantiomers of ketorolac (up to 6 microg) when administered alone. However, i.th. administration of a fixed ratio (1:1) of morphine plus racemic ketorolac or of morphine plus the (S)-enantiomer of ketorolac (S-ketorolac) produced a dose- and time-related antiallodynic effect: ED50 114 +/- 35.9 microg (total dose) for morphine plus ketorolac and 70.5 +/- 21.0 microg (total dose) for morphine plus S-ketorolac. The combination of i.th. morphine plus the (R)-enantiomer of ketorolac (R-ketorolac) (up to 200 microg total dose) was without effect. Similar antiallodynic activity was obtained for the co-administration of i.th. morphine and intravenous (i.v.) racemic ketorolac. In order to investigate the role of cyclooxygenase (COX) isozymes, relatively selective COX1 (piroxicam) and COX2 N-[2-cyclohexyloxy-4-nitrophenyl] metanesulfonamide (NS-398) inhibitors were administered i.th. (60 microg) alone or together with i.th. morphine. Piroxicam, NS-398, morphine and vehicle (90% DMSO) were without significant antiallodynic effect when administered alone, but moderate antiallodynic effects were produced by i.th. administration of fixed ratio (1:1) combinations of morphine with 60 microg each (highest soluble dose) of piroxicam (%MPE = 40.8 +/- 10.2) or NS-398 (%MPE = 32.4 +/- 9.5). Further, the combined i.th. administration of morphine, piroxicam and NS-398 in fixed 1:1:1 ratio (60 microg each) resulted in a supraadditive antiallodynic effect (%MPE = 70.4 +/- 10.8). Finally, morphine, but not ketorolac, given i.th. produced dose-dependent anti nociception in either the tail-flick or the paw-flick tests. However, there was no synergy between morphine and ketorolac against thermal nociception in either of the tests. These findings suggest that spinal prostanoids produced via both COX1 and COX2 pathways may play a role in neuropathic pain states and suggest the clinical utility of opioid plus COX-inhibitor combination therapy.
23301897	Bioactive flavaglines and other constituents isolated from Aglaia perviridis.	Eight new compounds, including two cyclopenta[b]benzopyran derivatives (1, 2), two cyclopenta[b]benzofuran derivatives (3, 4), three cycloartane triterpenoids (5-7), and an apocarotenoid (8), together with 16 known compounds, were isolated from the chloroform-soluble partitions of separate methanol extracts of a combination of the fruits, leaves, and twigs and of the roots of Aglaia perviridis collected in Vietnam. Isolation work was monitored using human colon cancer cells (HT-29) and facilitated with an LC/MS dereplication procedure. The structures of the new compounds (1-8) were determined on the basis of spectroscopic data interpretation. The Mosher ester method was employed to determine the absolute configurations of 5-7, and the absolute configuration of the 9,10-diol unit of compound 8 was established by a dimolybdenum tetraacetate [Mo2(AcO)4] induced circular dichroism procedure. Seven known rocaglate derivatives (9-15) exhibited significant cytotoxicity against the HT-29 cell line, with rocaglaol (9) being the most potent (ED50 0.0007 μM). The new compounds 2-4 were also active against this cell line, with ED50 values ranging from 0.46 to 4.7 μM. The cytotoxic compounds were evaluated against a normal colon cell line, CCD-112CoN. In addition, the new compound perviridicin B (2), three known rocaglate derivatives (9, 11, 12), and a known sesquiterpene, 2-oxaisodauc-5-en-12-al (17), showed significant NF-κB (p65) inhibitory activity in an ELISA assay.
23553560	Axitinib in metastatic renal cell carcinoma: results of a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis.	Axitinib is a potent and selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2, and 3, approved for second-line therapy for advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Axitinib population pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships were evaluated. Using nonlinear mixed effects modeling with pooled data from 383 healthy volunteers, 181 patients with metastatic RCC, and 26 patients with other solid tumors in 17 trials, the disposition of axitinib was best described by a 2-compartment model with first-order absorption and a lag time, with estimated mean systemic clearance (CL) of 14.6 L/h and central volume of distribution (Vc ) of 47.3 L. Of 12 covariates tested, age over 60 years and Japanese ethnicity were associated with decreased CL, whereas Vc increased with body weight. However, the magnitude of predicted changes in exposure based on these covariates does not warrant dose adjustments. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression and logistic regression analyses showed that higher exposure and diastolic blood pressure were independently associated with longer progression-free and overall survivals and higher probability of partial response in metastatic RCC patients. These findings support axitinib dose titration to increase plasma exposure in patients who tolerate axitinib, and also demonstrate diastolic blood pressure as a potential marker of efficacy.
9521275	Testosterone versus testosterone and testolactone in treating reproductive and sexual dysfunction in men with epilepsy and hypogonadism.	Antiepileptic drug-induced reductions in serum levels of biologically active testosterone and elevations in serum estradiol (E2) may contribute to sexual dysfunction among men with epilepsy. Treatment using a combination of testosterone and the aromatase inhibitor testolactone may have significantly better effects on sexual function and also seizure frequency than testosterone alone.
17073521	Oregovomab: anti-CA-125 monoclonal antibody B43.13--AltaRex, B43.13, MAb B43.13, monoclonal antibody B43.13.	ViRexx Medical Corp is developing the murine monoclonal antibody oregovomab [OvaRex, MAb B43.13] for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Oregovomab targets the circulating tumour-associated antigen CA 125, which is shed from the surface of human ovarian cancer cells; the antibodies induce broad cellular and humoral immune responses against CA 125 via complex formation. Unlike free CA 125, CA 125-oregovomab complexes can prime dendritic cells, leading to downstream activation of T cells. The antibody is undergoing advanced clinical development. AltaRex, the originator of oregovomab, was acquired by, and merged into, ViRexx Medical Corp in December 2004. AltaRex (now ViRexx Medical Corp) has established several strategic corporate alliances for the development and/or commercialisation of oregovomab. Unither Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of United Therapeutics Corporation, entered into a licensing agreement with ViRexx in April 2002. The agreement covers most territories worldwide, except Europe and the Middle East, which are covered by other agreements (see below); ViRexx did retain the rights to most member nations of the EU and certain other countries. In August 2003, the agreement was extended, granting United Therapeutics Corporation development rights for Germany. AltaRex and Dompe entered into a distribution agreement for oregovomab in July 2004. Territories included in the agreement are Italy, Spain, Portugal, Hungary, Poland, Czech Republic, Switzerland, Austria and certain other Eastern European countries. Under the terms of the agreement, ViRexx retains responsibility for product development and registration of the antibody, upon commercialisation in the agreed territory. The two companies will work closely to achieve product registration throughout Europe. In June 2001, Dompe entered into a sublicensing agreement with FAES for the commercialisation of oregovomab in Spain and Portugal. ViRexx is also seeking collaboration partners for Northern European markets. Medison Pharma and AltaRex entered into an agreement in April 2002. Under the terms of the agreement, the two companies will establish a joint venture to market oregovomab in Israel and the Middle East. ViRexx also has an agreement with Genesis Pharma covering the commercialisation of the antibody in Greece, Turkey, Cyprus and the Balkans. Unither Pharmaceuticals has completed trial enrollment for its two pivotal phase III trials investigating oregovomab for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. In June 2006, Unither reached its enrollment goal of 177 patients for the IMPACT II study, the second of two identical double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. The IMPACT I study achieved its enrollment target in December 2005. Both IMPACT studies are designed to assess the effect of oregovomab on time to disease relapse in patients with advanced ovarian cancer (stage III/IV) who have achieved an optimal response with front-line chemotherapy, and are being conducted at over 60 sites across the US. Data from the studies are intended to support registration of the antibody in the US. ViRexx also plans to utilise results from the IMPACT studies to support regulatory filings in Europe and in other countries. In addition, a phase II trial is being conducted to evaluate two dosing regimens of adjunctive oregovomab plus platinum-based first-line chemotherapy in patients with advanced ovarian cancer. The enrollment target of 40 patients has been achieved; primary study analysis is anticipated to be completed by the end of 2006. Several phase II trials with oregovomab as monotherapy or in combination with other chemotherapeutics have been completed across the US and Canada. Clinical trials have also been conducted in the EU, but ViRexx has suspended such EU studies on the basis of commercial considerations. Oregovomab has orphan drug status for the treatment of ovarian cancer; designation was granted by the US and the EU in 1996 and 2002, respectively. In addition, the US FDA granted fast-track status to the antibody in 1998. AltaRex (now ViRexx Medical Corp) has been awarded the US patent covering the company's technology for administering a low dose of foreign antibody to patients expressing the CA 125 antigen. A second US patent has also been issued for oregovomab covering the technique of photoactivation using ultraviolet light to modify antibodies and enhance specific beneficial immune responses. Furthermore, AltaRex was granted a 'multi-epitopic' patent application covering oregovomab by the European Patent Office (EPO) in October 2003. The patent covers the company's technology of IV administration of a low-dose foreign antibody, such as oregovomab, to patients expressing the target tumour-associated antigen CA 125. The EPO's grant of the patent for the European Union enables intellectual property protection of oregovomab in the great majority of worldwide markets.
15322419	Association of norepinephrine transporter gene with methylphenidate response.	OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the association between alleles of the norepinephrine transporter gene and the methylphenidate response. METHOD: Chinese Han youths with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder recruited in the Outpatient Department of the Institute of Mental Health from 2001 to 2004 were treated with methylphenidate in doses of 0.45 to 0.60 mg/kg per day. Behavior changes were measured by the ADHD Rating Scale-IV when optimal doses were reached. The single-nucleotide polymorphic allele of norepinephrine transporter gene G1287A was used as the genetic marker, and the genotypes were identified by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. RESULTS: A significant association was found between norepinephrine transporter gene G1287A genotypes and response to methylphenidate for hyperactive-impulsive subscale scores (mean score reduction was 7.15 and 6.94 for G/G and G/A genotype, respectively, and 2.13 for A/A; p = .012) but not inattentive scores. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest an association between the G1287A polymorphism of the norepinephrine transporter gene and variation in methylphenidate response. Further work is needed to confirm this finding and to assess its generalization to other ethnic groups.
17008880	Regulation of UVB-induced IL-8 and MCP-1 production in skin keratinocytes by increasing vitamin C uptake via the redistribution of SVCT-1 from the cytosol to the membrane.	It is well known that UVB (290-320 nm) induces inflammation in skin by the transcription and release of cytokines and chemokines from skin keratinocytes. In addition, it is considered that intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays an important role in UVB-induced inflammatory response in the skin. Therefore, we investigated the effect of vitamin C, a potent antioxidant, on the regulation of UVB-induced skin inflammation via the modulation of chemokines production. Vitamin C uptake into keratinocytes is increased by UVB irradiation in a time- and dose-dependent manner through the translocation of sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter-1 (SVCT-1), a vitamin C-specific transporter, from the cytosol to the membrane. To evaluate the effect of vitamin C on the chemokine mRNA expression, we performed RNase protection assay. As a result, there was a remarkable change in chemokine mRNA expression, especially IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 expression. In addition, increased IL-8 and MCP-1 mRNA expressions were suppressed by vitamin C treatment. We also confirmed the results of protein levels measured by ELISA. Taken together, vitamin C uptake is increased in UVB-irradiated keratinocytes through the translocation of SVCT-1 and regulates inflammatory response in the skin via the downregulation of IL-8 and MCP-1 production.
7958159	Effects of labor and delivery on fibrinolysis.	Because timing of sampling is crucial in an investigation of the effects of labor and delivery on fibrinolysis we conducted a study of fibrinolytic markers in plasma of 10 healthy multiparous women in whom labor was induced, which allowed standardization of sampling times in relation to the course of labor and delivery. Blood samples were taken 5 min before the start of oxytocin infusion, at full cervical dilatation, and within 5 min after delivery of the placenta. A sample of mixed free flowing cord blood was obtained after delivery with the placenta in situ. Variables determined were tissue-type plasminogen-activator (t-PA) and the plasminogen activator inhibitors type 1 (PAI-1) and type 2 (PAI-2). The only significant change between the beginning of the induction of labor and the end of the first stage of labor was a rise in t-PA antigen (P = 0.01). All variables, except PAI-2 antigen, changed significantly after delivery of the placenta: t-PA antigen and activity showed a rise (P < 0.05), accompanied by a fall in PAI-1 antigen and activity (P < 0.01). T-PA activity in cord plasma was higher (P < 0.01) in comparison with maternal plasma concentrations at the end of the first stage of labor, t-PA antigen levels were similar, and PAI-1 antigen and activity and PAI-2 antigen were lower in cord plasma (P < 0.001). Our study shows that activation of the maternal fibrinolytic system can already be detected during labor, with a marked further increase in fibrinolytic potential after placental separation.
15311727	Frovatriptan succinate, a 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist for migraine.	Frovatriptan succinate is one of the most recent serotonin receptor agonists to receive FDA, approved labelling for use in the acute management of migraine with or without aura in adults. The mechanism of action of frovatriptan is thought to be similar to that of a serotonin agonist. However, frovatriptan has distinctive pharmacokinetic and pharmacologic properties, chiefly, a high affinity for serotonin receptors 1B and 1D and a long elimination half-life; frovatriptan was shown to be more selective for cerebral than coronary arteries, a property which makes frovatriptan more favourable in patients at risk of coronary artery disease. Additionally, frovatriptan has a half-life of approximately 25 h, substantially longer than that of any other agent within its class. This property makes frovatriptan suitable for patients who typically suffer migraines of long duration and/or those who suffer migraine recurrence. The efficacy of frovatriptan in the treatment of acute migraine was demonstrated in five double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials. At 2h, headache response rates for frovatriptan 2.5 mg ranged from 38 to 40% compared to 22-35% for placebo. Headache recurrence for frovatriptan 2.5 mg at 24h ranged from 9 to 14% compared with 18% in placebo subjects. Frovatriptan has no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions with drugs used for migraine prophylaxis or with commonly prescribed medications. Adverse effects of frovatriptan including dizziness, paresthesia, dry mouth, fatigue and flushing were generally mild and well tolerated. Given the fact that patient response to serotonin agonists is individualised, and selecting an effective agent may involve trial and error, frovatriptan is a welcome alternative in the acute management of migraine.
14751426	Effects of clozapine and its metabolites on the 5-HT2 receptor system in cortical and hippocampal cells in vitro.	PURPOSE: The goal of the present study was to determine the effects of clozapine (Cloz) and its metabolites norclozapine (Norcloz) and clozapine-N-oxide (Cloz-N-oxide) on the 5-HT(2) receptor system on the levels of protein and gene expression in in vitro systems of primary cortical cells of the rat and human hippocampal SHS5Y5 neuroblastoma cells. METHODS: Clinically relevant concentrations of Cloz (200/400 ng/ml) and its metabolites (200 ng/ml) were used for the examination of the effects of Cloz and its metabolites on serotoninergic 5-HT(2) receptor parameters (density, affinity and mRNA levels) as well as on glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA levels in primary cortical cells of the rat after treatment for 24 h under in vitro conditions. To compare the results to human cells, we also measured treatment-induced changes in 5-HT(2) and GAPDH mRNA levels in human hippocampal SHS5Y5 cells. RESULTS: A significant decrease was found in primary cortical cells for 5-HT(2) receptor density (Cloz 200/Cloz 400/Norcloz 200 and Cloz-N-oxide 200 vs. control) and 5-HT(2A) receptor mRNA levels (Cloz 200 vs. control). 5-HT(2A) receptor mRNA levels were also significantly reduced (Norcloz 200 vs. control) in SHS5Y5 cells. GAPDH mRNA levels were not affected. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study show that Cloz and Norcloz induce significant alterations on the 5-HT(2) receptor system in primary cortical cells of the rat and in human hippocampal cells.
17558310	The 1976C>T polymorphism in the adenosine A2A receptor gene does not affect the vasodilator response to adenosine in humans in vivo.	The 1976C>T polymorphism in the adenosine A2A receptor gene (ADORA2A) modulates the psychological response to administration of the adenosine receptor antagonist caffeine. We quantified the vascular response to adenosine and caffeine to determine the relevance of this variant allele in the physiological response to these agents. We selected 10 study participants with the TT genotype and 10 CC controls, matched for activities of other proteins involved in the metabolism of adenosine. The vasodilator response to the intrabrachial administration of adenosine (0.5, 1.5, 5.0, 15.0, and 50.0 microg/min/dl; venous occlusion plethysmography) was not different between the groups (P=0.4). In addition, the effect of subsequent administration of caffeine (90 microg/min/dl) was not different (P=0.7). We conclude that the 1976C>T polymorphism does not affect the vascular response to adenosine and caffeine in humans in vivo. Therefore, this polymorphism does not contribute to the variation in the effects of adenosine receptor stimulation.
3828735	Mechanism of the haemostatic effect of ethanolamine oleate in the injection sclerotherapy for oesophageal varices.	Changes in coagulation and fibrinolysis were investigated in 20 patients with oesophageal varices, who underwent endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) with 5 per cent ethanolamine oleate (EO), by means of serial determination of plasma fibrinopeptide A (FPA) and fibrinopeptide B beta 15-42 (B beta 15-42). One hour after the completion of EIS, the value of FPA was significantly increased to 38.1 +/- 11.1 ng/ml (mean +/- s.e.m.) from a pre-EIS value of 7.1 +/- 1.4 ng/ml (P less than 0.01) and it gradually returned to normal range by 48 h after EIS. A very similar change was observed in the value of B beta 15-42 (P less than 0.01). These observations indicated that EIS provokes transient activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis. In vitro studies, however, revealed that EO inhibits fibrin clot formation because of the Ca2+-chelating ability of its constituent ethanolamine, although oleate or benzyl alcohol exhibited procoagulant activity in FPA formation in vitro. Nevertheless, an external application of EO or oleate over decapsulized kidney of rat resulted in a significant accumulation of 125I-labelled fibrin(ogen). From these results it was suggested that intravascular injection of EO, which exerts an inhibitory effect on coagulation in vitro, activates the local coagulation system. The activation may be accelerated by an acute inflammatory process provoked by oleate, which is supported by such clinical manifestations as mild fever, retrosternal pain leukocytosis and an increase in plasma fibrinogen level which was observed in all during the period.
15878185	Fatty acid metabolism as a target for obesity treatment.	Although metabolites and energy balance have long been known to play roles in the regulation of food intake, the potential role of fatty acid metabolism in this process has been considered only recently. Fatty acid synthase (FAS) catalyzes the condensation of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA to generate long-chain fatty acids in the cytoplasm, while the breakdown of fatty acids (beta-oxidation) occurs in mitochondria and is regulated by carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1), the rate-limiting step for the entry of fatty acids into the mitochondria. Inhibition of FAS using cerulenin or synthetic FAS inhibitors such as C75 reduces food intake and induces profound reversible weight loss. Subsequent studies reveal that C75 also stimulates CPT-1 and increases beta-oxidation. Hypotheses as to the mechanisms by which C75 and cerulenin mediate their effects have been proposed. Centrally, these compounds alter the expression profiles of feeding-related neuropeptides, often inhibiting the expression of orexigenic peptides. Whether through centrally mediated or peripheral mechanisms, C75 also increases energy consumption, which contributes to weight loss. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that at least part of C75's effects is mediated by modulation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a known peripheral energy-sensing kinase. Collectively, these data suggest a role for fatty acid metabolism in the perception and regulation of energy balance.
23512787	Neuroprotective Effects of Puerarin on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine induced Parkinson's Disease Model in Mice.	Puerarin, an active component of Pueraria montana var. lobata (Willd.) Sanjappa & Pradeep is well-known for its anti-oxidative and neuroprotective activities. Although anti-Parkinson's disease activity of puerarin was reported in both of in vivo and in vitro model, detailed mechanisms are not clarified. In this study, we addressed that puerarin attenuated 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced behavioral deficits, dopaminergic neuronal degeneration and dopamine depletion. Puerarin administration enhanced glutathione (GSH) activity, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) expression and PI3K/Akt pathway activation, which might ameliorate MPTP injection-induced progressive elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation in mice. In addition to the effect on ROS, puerarin ameliorated MPTP-reduced lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A (Lamp 2A) expression. Taken together, our data demonstrate that puerarin attenuates MPTP-induced dopaminergic neuronal degeneration via modulating GDNF expression, PI3K/Akt pathway and GSH activation, which subsequently ameliorate MPTP-induced ROS formation and decrease of Lamp 2A expression.

8301142	Retinoic acid inhibition of IL-1-induced IL-6 production by human lung fibroblasts.	IL-6 is a multi-functional cytokine that plays an important role in normal biologic homeostasis and disease pathogenesis. Retinoids are vitamin A analogs that regulate the function of a wide variety of inflammatory and structural cells. To further understand the biology of retinoids and IL-6 we determined whether all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) and other retinoids regulate lung fibroblast IL-6 production. RA did not stimulate fibroblast IL-6 production. Instead, it inhibited the production of IL-6 by IL-1-stimulated cells. This effect was dose-dependent with an IC50 of 10(-7) M RA and significant inhibition being noted with doses of RA as low as 10(-8) M. These inhibitory effects could not be explained by cytotoxicity or a shift in the kinetics of IL-6 production. They also did not appear to involve alterations in the early events in IL-1-induced IL-6 production, because RA inhibited IL-6 production even when added 6 h after IL-1 and RA did not inhibit IL-1 binding to cell surface IL-1 receptors. RA inhibition of IL-6 protein production was associated with a comparable decrease in IL-6 mRNA accumulation and gene transcription. 13-cis-retinoic acid, retinol, retinaldehyde, all-trans etretin, Ro 13-6298, and 9-cis retinoic acid also inhibited IL-1-induced IL-6 production. However, 4-hydroxyphenyl retinamide and etretinate did not share this property. The inhibitory effects of these analogues may be mediated by nuclear retinoic acid receptors as mRNA encoding RAR-alpha, RAR-gamma, and RXR-alpha were present, and RAR-beta was induced by RA in human lung fibroblasts. These studies demonstrate that RA and other retinoid analogs inhibit IL-1-induced IL-6 production and that this effect is analog-specific and, at least partially, transcriptionally mediated.
2833901	Effects of felodipine (a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker) and analogues on calmodulin-dependent enzymes.	We have examined the effects on the activities of three calmodulin-dependent enzymes (cAMP phosphodiesterase, caldesmon kinase and myosin light chain kinase) of the dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel blocker felodipine and three analogues (p-chloro, oxidized and t-butyl) exhibiting different pharmacological potencies. The cAMP phosphodiesterase was inhibited completely by felodipine and the p-chloro analogue with IC50 values of 3.7 and 1.5 microM respectively. The oxidized and t-butyl analogues were relatively ineffective in inhibiting cAMP phosphodiesterase. Felodipine and the p-chloro analogue inhibited the basal (Ca2+/calmodulin-independent) activity of cAMP phosphodiesterase as well as the calmodulin-stimulated activity. Calmodulin was relatively ineffective in preventing inhibition of cAMP phosphodiesterase by felodipine and the p-chloro analogue. These observations suggest that felodipine may act directly on the phosphodiesterase as well as through calmodulin. Felodipine and the p-chloro analogue inhibited Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent caldesmon kinase with similar potencies (IC50 = 17.4 microM), whereas the oxidized and t-butyl analogues caused no inhibition. Similarly, felodipine and the p-chloro analogue inhibited myosin light chain kinase activity whether the isolated 20 kD light chain (IC50 = 12.6 microM) or intact myosin (IC50 = 11.0 microM) was used as substrate. Inhibition in each case was prevented by excess calmodulin. The oxidized and t-butyl derivatives caused little or no inhibition. Finally, the effects of felodipine and the three analogues on two processes which are dependent on myosin phosphorylation were examined, namely the actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity of myosin and the assembly of myosin filaments. Felodipine and the p-chloro analogue inhibited the actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity of smooth muscle myosin (IC50 = 25.1 microM). The oxidized and t-butyl analogues exhibited no inhibition. Similarly, felodipine and the p-chloro analogue blocked myosin filament assembly induced by low concentrations of calmodulin, whereas the oxidized and t-butyl analogues did not. Again, inhibition of the actin-activated myosin Mg2+-ATPase and myosin filament assembly by felodipine and the p-chloro analogue could be reversed by raising the calmodulin concentration. These observations suggest that some of the pharmacological actions of felodipine on smooth muscle may involve inhibition of calmodulin-dependent enzymes which are functionally involved in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction.
15261283	Pharmacological evaluation of selected arylpiperazines with atypical antipsychotic potential.	Six active compounds, among previously synthesized and screened arylpiperazines, were selected and evaluated for the binding affinity to rat dopamine, serotonin and alpha(1) receptors. Two compounds with benztriazole group had a 5-HT(2A)/D(2) binding ratio characteristic for atypical neuroleptics (>1, pK(i) values). Compound 2, 5-[2-[4-(2,3-dimethyl-phenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]ethyl]1H-benzotriazole, expressed clozapine-like in vitro binding profile at D(2), 5-HT(2A) and alpha 1 receptors and a higher affinity for 5-HT(1A) receptors than clozapine. Also, it exhibited the noncataleptic behavioural pattern of atypical antipsychotics and antagonized d-amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion in rats.
23026700	Cassia tora (Leguminosae) seed extract alleviates high-fat diet-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver.	The aim of this study was to examine the effects of Cassia tora seeds on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced hepatic steatosis, and elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind its effects. After being fed a HFD for two weeks, rats were orally dosed with Cassia seed ethanol extract (CSEE) (100, 200, or 300mg/kg) once daily for 8weeks. CSEE induced dose-dependent reductions in plasma lipid levels, as well as decreased the over hepatic lipid accumulation. Furthermore, CSEE treatment improved HFD-induced hepatic histological lesions. CSEE enhanced the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its primary downstream targeting enzyme, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, up-regulated the gene expression of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1, and down-regulated sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 and fatty acid synthase protein levels in the livers of HFD-fed rats. AMPK inhibition by compound C retarded CSEE-induced reduction in triglyceride accumulation in HepG2 cells stimulated by insulin. Our findings suggest that CSEE may regulate hepatic lipid homeostasis related with an AMPK-dependent signaling pathway. Targeting AMPK activation with CSEE may represent a promising approach for the prevention and treatment of obesity-related non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
10866053	Correlations of receptor binding and metabolic and mitogenic potencies of insulin analogs designed for clinical use.	In recent years, analogs of human insulin have been engineered with the aim of improving therapy for people with diabetes. To ensure that the safety profile of the human hormone is not compromised by the molecular modifications, the toxico-pharmacological properties of insulin analogs should be carefully monitored. In this study, we compared the insulin and IGF-I receptor binding properties and metabolic and mitogenic potencies of insulin aspart (B28Asp human insulin), insulin lispro (B28Lys,B29Pro human insulin), insulin glargine (A21Gly,B31Arg,B32Arg human insulin), insulin detemir (NN304) [B29Lys(epsilon-tetradecanoyl), desB30 human insulin], and reference insulin analogs. Receptor affinities were measured using purified human receptors, insulin receptor dissociation rates were determined using Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing the human insulin receptor, metabolic potencies were evaluated using primary mouse adipocytes, and mitogenic potencies were determined in human osteosarcoma cells. Metabolic potencies correlated well with insulin receptor affinities. Mitogenic potencies in general correlated better with IGF-I receptor affinities than with insulin receptor off-rates. The 2 rapid-acting insulin analogs aspart and lispro resembled human insulin on all parameters, except for a slightly elevated IGF-I receptor affinity of lispro. In contrast, the 2 long-acting insulin analogs, glargine and detemir, differed significantly from human insulin. The combination of the B31B32diArg and A21Gly substitutions provided insulin glargine with a 6- to 8-fold increased IGF-I receptor affinity and mitogenic potency compared with human insulin. The attachment of a fatty acid chain to LysB29 provided insulin detemir with reduced receptor affinities and metabolic and mitogenic potencies but did not change the balance between mitogenic and metabolic potencies. The safety implications of the increased growth-stimulating potential of insulin glargine are unclear. The reduced in vitro potency of insulin detemir might explain why this analog is not as effective on a molar basis as human insulin in humans.
19259968	beta(2)-adrenoceptors are critical for antidepressant treatment of neuropathic pain.	OBJECTIVE: Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are one of the first-line pharmacological treatments against neuropathic pain. TCAs increase the extracellular concentrations of noradrenaline and serotonin by blocking the reuptake transporters of these amines. However, the precise downstream mechanism leading to the therapeutic action remains identified. In this work, we evaluated the role of adrenergic receptors (ARs) in the action of TCAs. METHODS: We used pharmacological and genetic approaches in mice to study the role of ARs in the antiallodynic action of the TCA nortriptyline. Peripheral neuropathy was induced by the insertion of a polyethylene cuff around the main branch of the sciatic nerve. The specific role of beta(2)-AR was evaluated by studying beta(2)-AR(-/-) mice. We used von Frey filaments to assess mechanical allodynia. RESULTS: The antiallodynic action of nortriptyline was not affected by cotreatment with the alpha(2)-AR antagonist yohimbine, the beta(1)-AR antagonists atenolol or metoprolol, or the beta(3)-AR antagonist SR 59230A. On the contrary, the beta-AR antagonists propranolol or sotalol, the beta(1)/beta(2)-AR antagonists alprenolol or pindolol, or the specific beta(2)-AR antagonist ICI 118,551 blocked the action of nortriptyline. The effect of nortriptyline was also totally absent in beta(2)-AR-deficient mice. INTERPRETATION: Stimulation of beta(2)-AR is necessary for nortriptyline to exert its antiallodynic action against neuropathic pain. These findings provide new insight into the mechanism by which antidepressants alleviate neuropathic pain. Our results also raise the question of a potential incompatibility between beta-blockers that affect beta(2)-AR and antidepressant drugs in patients treated for neuropathic pain.
23558743	Human polymerase kappa uses a template-slippage deletion mechanism, but can realign the slipped strands to favour base substitution mutations over deletions.	Polymerases belonging to the DinB class of the Y-family translesion synthesis DNA polymerases have a preference for accurately and efficiently bypassing damaged guanosines. These DinB polymerases also generate single-base (-1) deletions at high frequencies with most occurring on repetitive 'deletion hotspot' sequences. Human DNA polymerase kappa (hPolκ), the eukaryotic DinB homologue, displays an unusual efficiency for to extend from mispaired primer termini, either by extending directly from the mispair or by primer-template misalignment. This latter property explains how hPolκ creates single-base deletions in non-repetitive sequences, but does not address how deletions occur in repetitive deletion hotspots. Here, we show that hPolκ uses a classical Streisinger template-slippage mechanism to generate -1 deletions in repetitive sequences, as do the bacterial and archaeal homologues. After the first nucleotide is added by template slippage, however, hPolκ can efficiently realign the primer-template duplex before continuing DNA synthesis. Strand realignment results in a base-substitution mutation, minimizing generation of more deleterious frameshift mutations. On non-repetitive sequences, we find that nucleotide misincorporation is slower if the incoming nucleotide can correctly basepair with the nucleotide immediately 5' to the templating base, thereby competing against the mispairing with the templating base.
23410153	Targeting the akt kinase to modulate survival, invasiveness and drug resistance of cancer cells.	The deregulation of oncogenic signaling pathways which provide survival advantages to tumor cells is mediated by multiple cellular networks. Among them, the PI3K-Akt-mTOR axis, in particular the serine/threonine kinase Akt, is recognized as a key player. The kinase is hyperactivated due to a variety of mechanisms including loss of PTEN, mutations in the PI3K catalytic subunit, receptor tyrosine kinase and Ras activation. Indeed, inappropriate activation of the Akt kinase is a common event in human tumors and Akt appears to be a critical player in cell survival that may also account for the therapeutic resistance and the invasive phenotype of tumors. Inhibition of Akt signalling results in apoptosis and growth inhibition of tumour cells with elevated Akt activity. A functional role in drug resistance is supported by evidence that tumor cells with acquired resistance to antitumor agents may display increased Akt activation and that treatment with molecularly targeted agents can activate feed-back loops involving Akt. This serine/threonine kinase may therefore represent an amenable target for modulation of sensitivity to compounds with different molecular features due to its pleiotropic role in cell survival. Different types of Akt inhibitors [i.e., ATP mimetics and pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain binders] have been generated and some of them have reached the clinical setting. The present review focuses on the i) mechanisms implicating Akt in increased survival and invasive potential of tumor cells of different tumor types and ii) on the development of Akt inhibitors as modulators of drug resistance.
19996149	In vitro characterization and pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin (BMS-512148), a potent sodium-glucose cotransporter type II inhibitor, in animals and humans.	(2S,3R,4R,5S,6R)-2-(3-(4-Ethoxybenzyl)-4-chlorophenyl)-6-hydroxymethyl-tetrahydro -2H-pyran-3,4,5-triol (dapagliflozin; BMS-512148) is a potent sodium-glucose cotransporter type II inhibitor in animals and humans and is currently under development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The preclinical characterization of dapagliflozin, to allow compound selection and prediction of pharmacological and dispositional behavior in the clinic, involved Caco-2 cell permeability studies, cytochrome P450 (P450) inhibition and induction studies, P450 reaction phenotyping, metabolite identification in hepatocytes, and pharmacokinetics in rats, dogs, and monkeys. Dapagliflozin was found to have good permeability across Caco-2 cell membranes. It was found to be a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) but not a significant P-gp inhibitor. Dapagliflozin was not found to be an inhibitor or an inducer of human P450 enzymes. The in vitro metabolic profiles of dapagliflozin after incubation with hepatocytes from mice, rats, dogs, monkeys, and humans were qualitatively similar. Rat hepatocyte incubations showed the highest turnover, and dapagliflozin was most stable in human hepatocytes. Prominent in vitro metabolic pathways observed were glucuronidation, hydroxylation, and O-deethylation. Pharmacokinetic parameters for dapagliflozin in preclinical species revealed a compound with adequate oral exposure, clearance, and elimination half-life, consistent with the potential for single daily dosing in humans. The pharmacokinetics in humans after a single dose of 50 mg of [(14)C]dapagliflozin showed good exposure, low clearance, adequate half-life, and no metabolites with significant pharmacological activity or toxicological concern.
23411279	Phenolics content and antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of legume fractions.	Two faba bean (Vicia faba L.) subspecies major and minor and lentil seeds grown in Algeria were separated into cotyledons and hulls. These fractions, together with their corresponding whole seeds, were extracted with two solvents, aqueous (70%) acetone and (80%) ethanol, and evaluated for antioxidant activity in relation to their phenolic contents. Acetone selectively extracted tannins from faba beans. The hulls always exhibited high antioxidant activity, measured using the reducing power (RP), antiradical activity (DPPH) or oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assays. Aqueous ethanol (80%) extract of lentil hulls exhibited high antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities preferentially inhibiting 15-LOX (IC(50), 55 μg/ml), with moderate COX-1 (IC(50), 66 μg/ml) and COX-2 (IC(50), 119 μg/ml) inhibitory effects on the COX pathway, whereas faba bean hull extracts exerted relatively mild LOX inhibitory activity.
17207582	Glutamate stimulates glutamate receptor interacting protein 1 degradation by ubiquitin-proteasome system to regulate surface expression of GluR2.	The glutamate receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) is a scaffolding protein in postsynaptic density (PSD), tethering AMPA receptors to other signaling proteins. Here we report that glutamate stimulation caused a rapid reduction in protein levels of GRIP1, but not that of glutamate receptor (GluR) 1, GluR2 and protein interacting with C kinase 1 (PICK1) in rat primary cortical neuron cultures. Down-regulation of GRIP1 by glutamate was blocked by carbobenzoxyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-leucinal (MG132), a proteasome inhibitor and by expression of K48R-ubiquitin, a dominant negative form of ubiquitin. The GRIP1 reduction was inhibited by MK-801, an N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, but not by 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), an AMPA receptor antagonist. EGTA and 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetra acetic acid tetrakis (BAPTA), two Ca2+ chelators, but not nifedipine, an L-type Ca2+ channel blocker, prevented GRIP1 degradation. Furthermore, MG132 prevented glutamate-stimulated reduction in surface amount of GluR2, and knockdown of GRIP1 by RNAi against GRIP1 reduced surface GluR2 in neurons. Our results suggest that glutamate induces GRIP1 degradation by proteasome through an NMDA receptor-Ca2+ pathway and that GRIP1 degradation may play an important role in regulating GluR2 surface expression.
23349483	Reduction of reactive oxygen species ameliorates metabolism-secretion coupling in islets of diabetic GK rats by suppressing lactate overproduction.	We previously demonstrated that impaired glucose-induced insulin secretion (IS) and ATP elevation in islets of Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats, a non-obese model of diabetes, were significantly restored by 30∼60 min suppression of endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction. In this study, we investigated the effect of longer (12 h) suppression of ROS on metabolism-secretion coupling in β-cells by exposure to tempol, a superoxide dismutase mimic, plus ebselen, a glutathione peroxidase mimic (TE-treatment). In GK islets, both H(2)O(2) and superoxide were sufficiently reduced and glucose-induced IS and ATP elevation were improved by TE-treatment. Glucose oxidation, an indicator of Krebs cycle velocity, also was improved by TE-treatment at high glucose, whereas glucokinase activity, which determines glycolytic velocity, was not affected. Lactate production was markedly increased in GK islets and TE-treatment reduced lactate production and protein expression of lactate dehydrogenase and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α). These results indicate that the Warburg-like effect, which is characteristic of aerobic metabolism in cancer cells by which lactate is overproduced with reduced linking to mitochondria metabolism, plays an important role in impaired metabolism-secretion coupling in diabetic β-cells and suggest that ROS reduction can improve mitochondrial metabolism by suppressinglactate overproduction through inhibition of HIF1α stabilization.
16792938	A simple phenotypic method for differentiation between acquired and chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamases in Escherichia coli.	BACKGROUND: Screening methods for the detection of plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases are technically demanding. The purpose of this study was to assess screening methods for the detection of these enzymes in clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. METHODS: Isolates were selected according to a resistance phenotype consistent with production of an AmpC-type beta-lactamase. Detection of acquired ampC genes was done with a multiplex ampC-PCR and sequencing. The phenotypic detection methods evaluated included visual examination of antibiogram plates to identify the presence of scattered colonies located near the edge of the inhibition halo of cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam, and a double-disc synergy test using cloxacillin (500 mg) to inhibit AmpC enzymes. RESULTS: Seventy-seven isolates were selected from among 6,209 isolates recovered. Acquired ampC genes (blaCMY-2, blaDHA-1, blaCMY-4 and blaACC-1) were found in 19 (24.7%) of these isolates, including 14 E. coli, two K. pneumoniae and three P. mirabilis isolates. The differential trait for the presence of colonies in the inhibition halo was 100% sensitive and specific. Similar results were obtained for the cloxacillin test, except for the E. coli isolates in which specificity was 10.3%. CONCLUSION: The phenotypic trait described here can be considered useful for suspecting the presence of these enzymes. The cloxacillin test was only useful in isolates lacking a natural AmpC beta-lactamase.
15740719	Binding domains of the oxytocin receptor for the selective oxytocin receptor antagonist barusiban in comparison to the agonists oxytocin and carbetocin.	We have analyzed binding domains of the oxytocin receptor for barusiban, a highly selective oxytocin receptor antagonist, in comparison to the combined vasopressin V1A/oxytocin receptor antagonist atosiban and the agonists oxytocin and carbetocin. For this purpose, chimeric 'gain-in function' oxytocin/vasopressin V2 receptors were expressed in COS-7 cells. These recombinant receptors have been produced by transfer of domains from the oxytocin receptor into the related vasopressin V2 receptor and have already been successfully employed for the identification of ligand binding domains at the oxytocin receptor (Postina, R., Kojro, E., Fahrenholz, F., 1996. Separate agonist and peptide antagonist binding sites of the oxytocin receptor defined by their transfer into the V2 vasopressin receptor. J. Biol. Chem. 271, 31593-31601). In displacement studies with 10 chimeric receptor constructs, the binding profile of barusiban was compared with the binding profiles of the ligands oxytocin, [Arg8]vasopressin, carbetocin, and atosiban. The binding profiles for the agonists oxytocin and carbetocin were found to be similar. For both agonists, important binding domains were the extracellular N-terminus (=E1) and the extracellular loops E2 and E3 from the oxytocin receptor. For the vasopressin V1A/oxytocin receptor antagonist atosiban, none of the receptor constructs were able to provide a binding with higher affinity than the starting vasopressin V2 receptor. In contrast, the binding of barusiban was significantly improved when the transmembrane domains 1 and 2 were transferred from the oxytocin receptor to the vasopressin V2 receptor. The binding domain of barusiban differs from the binding domain of the agonists and the nonselective oxytocin receptor antagonist d(CH2)5[Tyr-(Me)2,Thr4,Orn8,Tyr9]vasotocin that has been used in previous studies. Overall, the data supported the concept of a central pocket site within the oxytocin receptor.
23449888	ARF represses androgen receptor transactivation in prostate cancer.	Androgen receptor (AR) signaling is essential for prostate cancer (PCa) development in humans. The initiation of prostate malignancy and progression to a castration-resistant stage are largely contributed by the modulation of AR activity through its coregulatory proteins. We and others previously reported that p14 alternative reading frame (ARF) expression is positively correlated with the disease progression and severity of PCa. Here, we provide evidence that p14ARF physically interacts with AR and functions as an AR corespressor in both an androgen-dependent and androgen-independent manner. Endogenous ARF (p14ARF in human and p19ARF in mouse) and AR colocalize in both human PCa cells in vitro and PCa tissues of mouse and human in vivo. Overexpression of p14ARF in PCa cells significantly attenuates the activities of androgen response region (ARR2)-probasin and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) promoters. The forced expression of p14ARF in cells resulted in a suppression of PSA and NK transcription factor locus 1 (NKX3.1) expression. Conversely, knockdown of endogenous p14ARF in human PCa cells with short hairpin RNA enhanced AR transactivation activities in a dose-dependent and p53-independent manner. Furthermore, we demonstrated that p14ARF binds to both the N-terminal domain and the ligand-binding domain of AR, and the human double minute 2 (HDM2)-binding motif of p14ARF is required for the interaction of p14ARF and AR proteins. p14ARF perturbs the androgen-induced interaction between the N terminus and C terminus of AR. Most importantly, we observed that the expression of PSA is reversely correlated with p14ARF in human prostate tissues. Taken together, our results reveal a novel function of ARF in modulation of AR transactivation in PCa.
15580557	Variations in human HM74 (GPR109B) and HM74A (GPR109A) niacin receptors.	HM74 (GPR109B) and the highly homologous gene, HM74A (GPR109A) code for Gi-G protein-coupled orphan receptors that recently have been discovered to be involved in the metabolic effects of niacin. The B vitamin niacin is an important agent used in the treatment of dyslipidemias, but its use is limited by side effects. The novel role of the adjacent HM74 and HM74A genes in the metabolism of niacin may provide new targets for drug development. Human genetic variations in HM74 and HM74A have been reported but have not been studied in detail. These variations may play a role in the response to agents targeting receptors coded by these genes. Here we show that many of the nonsynonymous SNPs listed in public databases for HM74 and HM74A are artifacts resulting from extensive homology between these two genes. This may be representative of a neglected phenomenon in reporting sequences of highly homologous genes. We provide primer sequences that permit selective amplification of the complete coding regions of HM74 and HM74A. Using these primers, we show that subsequent sequencing of HM74 and HM74A reveals a novel and unique variation in the HM74A gene. Haplotype analysis suggests four SNPs can define the five major haplotypes that lie within a single haplotype block encompassing these two genes.
10580458	Adverse upper gastrointestinal effects of rofecoxib compared with NSAIDs.	CONTEXT: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced gastrointestinal (GI) toxic effects, such as upper GI tract perforations, symptomatic gastroduodenal ulcers, and upper GI tract bleeding (PUBs), are thought to be attributable to cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) inhibition. Rofecoxib specifically inhibits COX-2 and has demonstrated a low potential for causing upper GI injury. OBJECTIVE: To compare the incidence of PUBs in patients with osteoarthritis treated with rofecoxib vs NSAIDs. DESIGN: Prespecified analysis of all 8 double-blind, randomized phase 2b/3 rofecoxib osteoarthritis trials conducted from December 1996 through March 1998, including one 6-week dose-ranging study, two 6-week efficacy studies vs ibuprofen and placebo, two 1-year efficacy studies vs diclofenac, two 6-month endoscopy studies vs ibuprofen and placebo, and one 6-week efficacy study vs nabumetone and placebo. SETTING: Multinational sites. Participants Osteoarthritis patients (N = 5435; mean age, 63 years [range, 38-94 years]; 72.9% women). INTERVENTIONS: Rofecoxib, 12.5, 25, or 50 mg/d (n = 1209, 1603, and 545, respectively, combined) vs ibuprofen, 800 mg 3 times per day (n = 847), diclofenac, 50 mg 3 times per day (n = 590); or nabumetone, 1500 mg/d (n = 127) (combined). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Cumulative incidence of PUBs for rofecoxib vs NSAIDs, based on survival analysis of time to first PUB diagnosis, using PUBs that met pre-specified criteria judged by a blinded, external adjudication committee. RESULTS: The incidence of PUBs over 12 months was significantly lower with rofecoxib vs NSAIDs (12-month cumulative incidence, 1.3% vs 1.8%; P = .046; rate per 100 patient-years, 1.33 vs 2.60; relative risk, 0.51; 95% confidence interval, 0.26-1.00). The cumulative incidence of dyspeptic GI adverse experiences was also lower with rofecoxib vs NSAIDS over 6 months (23.5% vs 25.5%; P = .02), after which the incidence rates converged. CONCLUSION: In a combined analysis of 8 trials of patients with osteoarthritis, treatment with rofecoxib was associated with a significantly lower incidence of PUBs than treatment with NSAIDs.
19888521	Structural features of low-molecular-weight heparins affecting their affinity to antithrombin.	As part of a more extensive investigation on structural features of different low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) that can affect their biological activities, Enoxaparin, Tinzaparin and Dalteparin were characterised with regards to the distribution of different chain length oligosaccharides as determined by size-exclusion (SE) chromatography, as well as their structure as defined by 2D-NMR spectra (HSQC). The three LMWHs were also fractionated into high affinity (HA) and no affinity (NA) pools with regards to their ability to bind antithrombin (AT). The HA fractions were further subfractionated and characterised. For the parent LMWHs and selected fractions, molecular weight parameters were measured using a SE chromatographic system with a triple detector (TDA) to obtain absolute molecular weights. The SE chromatograms clearly indicate that Enoxaparin is consistently richer in shorter oligosaccharides than Tinzaparin and Dalteparin. Besides providing the content of terminal groups and individual glucosamine and uronic acid residues with different sulfate substituents, the HSQC-NMR spectra permitted us to evaluate and correlate the content of the pentasaccharide, AT-binding sequence A-G-A*-I-A (AT-bs) through quantification of signals of the disaccharide sequence G-A*. Whereas the percent content of HA species is approximately the same for the three LMWHs, substantial differences were observed for the chain distribution of AT-bs as a function of length, with the AT-bs being preferentially contained in the longest chains of each LMWH. The above information will be useful in establishing structure-activity relationships currently under way. This study is therefore critical for establishing correlations between structural features of LMWHs and their AT-mediated anticoagulant activity.
23565654	Controlling the Effective Surface Area and Pore Size Distribution of sp(2) Carbon Materials and Their Impact on the Capacitance Performance of These Materials.	A series of sp(2) carbon materials with different specific surface area (SSA) and controlled pore size distribution (PSD) were synthesized at large scale through a facile and low-cost method. The SSA and PSD of these carbon materials were controlled by using different carbon sources and preparation methods. With different total and effective SSA (E-SSA) and PSD, the impacts on their capacitance performance were investigated thoroughly, which demonstrated that both E-SSA and PSD played the most important roles in their capacitance performance. Furthermore, theoretical modeling was performed, and the results are in agreement with the experimental results for the influence of E-SSA and PSD on their capacitance performance. Based on these, a general model using the slit/cylindrical NL-DFT approach is proposed for the estimation of the specific capacitance of sp(2) carbon materials, which offers a simple but reliable method to predict the capacitance performance of these materials, thus speeding up the design and screening of the materials for high-performance supercapacitor and other surface area related devices.
22922115	A step toward the reactivation of aged cholinesterases - Crystal structure of ligands binding to aged human butyrylcholinesterase.	Organophosphorus nerve agents irreversibly inhibit cholinesterases. Phosphylation of the catalytic serine can be reversed by the mean of powerful nucleophiles like oximes. But the phosphyl adduct can undergo a rapid spontaneous reaction leading to an aged enzyme, i.e., a conjugated enzyme that is no longer reactivable by oximes. One strategy to regain reactivability is to alkylate the phosphylic adduct. Specific alkylating molecules were synthesized and the crystal structures of the complexes they form with soman-aged human butyrylcholinesterase were solved. Although the compounds bind in the active site gorge of the aged enzyme, the orientation of the alkylating function appears to be unsuitable for efficient alkylation of the phosphylic adduct. However, these crystal structures provide key information to design efficient alkylators of aged-butyrylcholinesterase and specific reactivators of butyrylcholinesterase.
11153163	Renal damage induced by the treatment with non-opioid analgesics--theoretical assumption or clinical significance.	"Non-opioid analgesics are some of the most widely used therapeutic agents in clinical practice today. The number of patients at risk for adverse events related to the use of these agents is rapidly expanding. While the gastrointestinal toxicity of these medications is well known, it has become increasingly apparent that the kidney is also an important target for untoward clinical events. Evidence of the nephrotoxicity of analgesic preparations is not sufficiently completed and available in our region. Analgesic-related renal injury has been classified based on mechanism of action into ""classic"" analgesic nephropathy and NSAID-related renal toxicity. From clinical point of view the renal side effects induced by analgesics can be classified into hemodynamic (functional) side effects and idiosyncratic side effects. The common link in both types of side effects seems to be renal ischemia related to prostaglandin synthesis inhibition. Key enzyme in this process is cyclooxygenase occurring in two isoforms: COX-1 and COX-2. Antiinflammatory effect of NSAIDs is mediated by COX-2 inhibition, while the side effects (gastrotoxicity, nephrotoxicity) by inhibition of COX-1. COX-1 was more inhibited by indomethacin and piroxicam and COX-2 by 6-MNA (active metabolite of nabumetone), diclofenac and ibuprofen. Nimesulide and meloxicam selectively block COX-2 and are recommended to patients at risk or treated with diuretics. (Tab. 2, Fig. 2, Ref. 38.)"
17202804	Gonadotropin-releasing hormone functionally antagonizes testosterone activation of the human androgen receptor in prostate cells through focal adhesion complexes involving Hic-5.	Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs constitute the most widely employed medical treatment for prostatic cancer. The predominant mechanism of action is presumed to be via the inhibition of gonadotropins and resultant decrease in androgen. However, GnRH analogs have also been shown to directly inhibit prostate cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo through antiproliferative cell cycle arrest and stimulation of apoptosis. Since the GnRH receptor has been shown to affect sex steroid hormone receptor function, we considered that part of GnRH analog actions on prostate cells may be mediated through modulation of the human androgen receptor. Using a model HEK293 cell line expressing the GnRH receptor, we demonstrated a novel signalling pathway of the GnRH receptor that induces nuclear translocation of the androgen receptor that renders it transcriptionally inactive. This mechanism involves the calcium-dependent tyrosine kinase Pyk2, the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Src and the focal adhesion protein/steroid receptor co-factor, Hic-5. In this setting there is a GnRH-induced association and nuclear translocation of the androgen receptor with Hic-5. GnRH-induced Pyk2 activation opposed the association of Hic-5 with androgen receptor as overexpression of a dominant negative Pyk2 enhanced the GnRH-induced nuclear translocation of a green fluorescent protein-tagged human androgen receptor. GnRH-induced c-Src activation resulted in the phosphorylation of expressed Hic-5 and promoted its association with the human androgen receptor. In contrast to testosterone, GnRH-induced nuclear translocation did not transcriptionally activate the androgen receptor. We then demonstrated that GnRH can also stimulate androgen receptor mobilization in human prostate PC3, BPH-1 and LNCaP cells, and in cultured rat ventral prostate cells through the same mechanism. To determine if GnRH could antagonize androgen effects in normal tissue, we examined the effect of GnRH on rat ventral prostate organ cultures and demonstrated that GnRH can functionally antagonize the actions of testosterone on prostate cell proliferation and tissue growth. This antagonism of testosterone action by GnRH may underlie in part the capacity of GnRH receptor activation to inhibit prostate tumor growth.
23441017	Phase stability and elastic properties of chromium borides with various stoichiometries.	Phase stability is important to the application of materials. By first-principles calculations, we establish the phase stability of chromium borides with various stoichiometries. Moreover, the phases of CrB3 and CrB4 have been predicted by using a newly developed particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Formation enthalpy-pressure diagrams reveal that the MoB-type structure is more energetically favorable than the TiI-type structure for CrB. For CrB2 , the WB2 -type structure is preferred at zero pressure. The predicted new phase of CrB3 belongs to the hexagonal P-6m2 space group and it transforms into an orthorhombic phase as the pressure exceeds 93 GPa. The predicted CrB4 (space group: Pnnm) phase is more energetically favorable than the previously proposed Immm structure. The mechanical and thermodynamic stabilities of predicted CrB3 and CrB4 are verified by the calculated elastic constants and formation enthalpies. The full phonon dispersion calculations confirm the dynamic stability of WB2 -type CrB2 and predicted CrB3 . The large shear moduli, large Young's moduli, low Poisson ratios, and low bulk and shear modulus ratios of CrB4 PSC and CrB4 PSD indicate that they are potential hard materials. Analyses of Debye temperature, electronic localization function, and electronic structure provide further understanding of the chemical and physical properties of these borides.
8263811	Nonadrenergic imidazoline binding sites on human platelets.	Human platelets are shown to possess at least two high-affinity, imidazol(in)e-preferring binding sites that are pharmacologically distinct from alpha-2 adrenoceptors. These nonadrenergic sites were radiolabeled even in the presence of a 10 microM norepinephrine mask of alpha-2 adrenoceptors. Heterogeneity at the nonadrenergic sites was demonstrated by comparing [3H]idazoxan (IDX) binding vs. [125I]p-iodoclonidine (PIC) binding. Nonadrenergic [125I]PIC-labeled sites were enriched in platelet plasma membranes, whereas the nonadrenergic sites labeled by [3H] IDX were codistributed between plasma and internal membranes (nonadrenergic [125I]PIC-labeled sites had Bmax = 62 fmol/mg in plasma membranes and 20 fmol/mg in internal membranes vs. the [3H]IDX-labeled sites had Bmax = 141 fmol/mg in plasma membranes and 192 fmol/mg in internal membranes). Furthermore, competition binding studies in the presence of a 10 microM norepinephrine mask revealed major (approximately 75%) and minor (approximately 25%) binding components on plasma membranes for [125I]PIC. Affinities for the major nonadrenergic [125I]PIC binding site were highly comparable to human subtype-I1 imidazol(in)e receptor sites in the brain stem (rank order: moxonidine > clonidine > cirazoline > IDX > amiloride). However, the minor component of [125I]PIC binding was similar to a site reported in kidney, having low affinities for all compounds tested, except guanabenz. Finally, a third nonadrenergic internal membrane site, labeled by [3H]IDX, was consistent with a subtype-I2 imidazol(in)e receptor site (rank order: cirazoline > IDX >> amiloride > moxonidine > clonidine). Thus, based on differential subcellular distributions and affinity constants, human platelets appear to possess imidazoline receptors (subtype-I1 imidazol(in)e receptor and subtype-I2 imidazol(in)e receptor), plus a novel guanabenz-sensitive site, as well as an alpha-2A adrenoceptor. These nonadrenoceptor binding sites may explain certain novel platelet aggregatory properties previously ascribed to clonidine and endogenous clonidine-displacing substance(s), and may serve as markers of imidazoline receptors in humans.
9773153	[In vivo selectivity of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on COX-1-COX-2 and gastrointestinal ulcers, in rats].	"UNLABELLED: This work was aimed to study COX-1 and COX-2 selectivity in 16 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), at ulcerogenic doses in 2 experimental models: 1) provided subcutaneously (sc), after solid food(SF), (antrum ulcers and intestinal erosions); and 2) orally (O) (fundic and intestinal erosions). METHODS: 17 groups of female Wistar rats (n = 7 each group), weighing 200 g, 36 h fasting with water ad libitum, were submitted to the following experiments: 1. SF (Cargill chow) during 1 h, and then sc: 1.1 ml saline; 2. diclofenac (Di); 3. indomethacine (Indo); 4. Ketorolac (Ke); 5. meloxicam (Mel); 6. Pyroxicam (P); 7. tenoxicam (T). The dose for the aforementioned drugs was 60 mg/kg; 8. aceclofenac (Ace); 9. 200 mg/kg nimesulide (Ni); 10. mefenamic acid (Mac); 11. aspirin (A); 12. etodolac (E); 13. ibuprophen (Ibu); 14. nabumetone (Na); 15. naproxene (Nap); 16. ketoprophen (Ket); 17. paracetamol (Pa), 500 mg/kg. II. The drugs where administered by orogastric tubing to the same groups of fasting animals. After 24 h the animals were killed by ether overdose. Laparotomy was performed and the stomach and the small intestine was removed. The percentage of antum ulcer, and fundic and intestinal erosion (mm2) was tabulated by planimetry. Blood and histological samples were obtained. RESULTS: The NSAIDs Indo, Ibu, Ke, Ket, P and Te yielded an antrum ulcer area: 5-29% and intestinal erosion, 101-395 mm2, similar to Indo (p > 0.50). In contrast there were neither ulcers nor intestinal erosions with Mac, A, Di, E and Nap (p > 0.50). While there were absence of ulcers with Ace, Me, Na, Ni and Pa and slight intestinal erosion (0-23 mm2; p < 0.01). II. There were differences in the following oral (NAIDs: Ace, Me, NA, Ni and Pa, yielding 0-5% fundic erosion and 0-22 mm2 intestinal erosion (p < 0.001). The other NSADs yielded 33-90% fundic erosion and 116-550 mm2 intestinal erosion, similarly to Indo (p > 0.50). HISTOLOGY: Leukocyte infiltrate in the gastrointestinal mucosa with all the NSADs, except Ibu and Pa. There was also neutrophilia (5000-20,000), but not with Ibu and Pa (700-1200). CONCLUSIONS: COX-2-COX-1 selectivity was demonstrated ""in vivo"" in aceclofenac, meloxicam, nabumetone, nimesulide and paracetamol."
16388933	Antidepressants suppress production of the Th1 cytokine interferon-gamma, independent of monoamine transporter blockade.	In this study, antidepressants with selectivity for the noradrenaline transporter (reboxetine and desipramine), or the serotonin transporter (fluoxetine and clomipramine) were examined in terms of their ability to promote an anti-inflammatory cytokine phenotype in human blood. In addition, we examined the ability of trimipramine; a tricyclic antidepressant that is devoid of monoamine reuptake inhibitory properties on cytokine production. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to stimulate monocyte-derived pro-inflammatory (IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-12) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines, whilst concanavalin A (Con A) was used to stimulate T-cell (Th(1): IFN-gamma and Th(2/3): IL-10) cytokines. All of the antidepressants suppressed IFN-gamma production in the 10-50 microM concentration range, irrespective of their preference for serotonin or noradrenaline transporters. This suppression of IFN-gamma production was paralleled by reduced T-cell proliferation, therefore we suggest that the ability of antidepressants to suppress IFN-gamma production may be related to their anti-proliferative properties. The fact that trimipramine also suppressed IFN-gamma production and T-cell proliferation indicates that these immunomodulatory actions of antidepressants are most likely unrelated to inhibition of monoamine reuptake. Interestingly, exposure to a lower concentration (1 microM) of the antidepressants tended to increase T-cell-derived IL-10 production, with significant effects elicited by the noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors reboxetine and desipramine. In contrast to the robust actions of antidepressants on T-cell derived cytokine production, they failed to induce any consistent change in LPS-induced monocyte cytokine production. Overall, our results indicate that IFN-gamma producing T-cells (Th(1) cells) are the major target for the immunomodulatory actions of antidepressants, and provide evidence questioning the relationship between the monoaminergic reuptake properties of antidepressants and their immunomodulatory effects. The potential clinical significance of the anti-inflammatory actions of antidepressants is discussed.
23423942	Use of gene expression data to determine effects on gonad phenotype in japanese medaka after exposure to trenbolone or estradiol.	Various aquatic bioassays using one of several fish species have been developed or are in the process of being developed by organizations like the US Environmental Protection Agency and the Office of Economic Cooperation and Development for testing potential endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Often, these involve assessment of the gonad phenotype of individuals as a key endpoint that is inputted into a risk or hazard assessment. Typically, gonad phenotype is determined histologically, which involves specialized and time-consuming techniques. The methods detailed here utilize an entirely different methodology, reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, to determine the relative expression levels of 4 genes after exposure to either 17β-estradiol or 17β-trenbolone and, by extension, the effects of EDCs on the phenotypic status of the gonad. The 4 genes quantified, Sox9b, protamine, Fig1α, and ZPC1, are all involved in gonad development and maintenance in Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes); these data were then inputted into a permutational multivariate analysis of variance to determine whether significant differences exist between treatment groups. This information in conjunction with the sexual genotype, which can be determined in medaka, can be used to determine adverse effects of exposure to EDCs in a similar fashion to the histologically determined gonad phenotype.

11741285	Ribostamycin inhibits the chaperone activity of protein disulfide isomerase.	In the process of screening of proteins binding to ribostamycin in bovine liver using the affinity column chromatography, we found that ribostamycin inhibited the chaperone activity of protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), but it did not inhibit the isomerase activity. PDI was identified by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. A 100:1 molar ratio of ribostamycin to PDI was almost sufficient to completely inhibit the chaperone activity of PDI. The binding affinity of ribostamycin to purified bovine PDI was determined by the Biacore system, which gave a K(D) value of 3.19 x 10(-4) M. This suggests that ribostamycin binds to region distinct from the CGHC motif of PDI. This is the first report to describe the inhibitor of the chaperone activity of PDI.
23327668	Bioactive abietane and ent-kaurane diterpenoids from Isodon tenuifolius.	Three new abietane diterpenoids, isoabietenins A-C (1-3), and 13 new ent-kauranoids, tenuifolins A-M (4-16), along with four known compounds (17-20), were isolated from the aerial parts of Isodon tenuifolius. The structures of the new metabolites were established on the basis of detailed spectroscopic analysis. The absolute configurations of 1, 15, and 16 were confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Selected compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxicity against a small panel of human tumor cell lines, and some compounds showed inhibitory effects. Furthermore, several isolates exhibited inhibitory activity against nitric oxide production in LPS-activated RAW264.7 macrophages.
23219593	4-tert-Octylphenol stimulates the expression of cathepsins in human breast cancer cells and xenografted breast tumors of a mouse model via an estrogen receptor-mediated signaling pathway.	Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are defined as environmental compounds that modulate steroid hormone receptor-dependent responses an abnormal manner, resulting in adverse health problems for humans such as cancer growth and metastasis. Cathepsins are proteases that have been implicated in cancer progression. However, there have been few studies about the association between cathepsins and estrogenic chemicals during the cancer progression. In this study, we examined the effect(s) of 4-tert-octylphenol (OP), a potent EDC, on the expression of cathepsins B and D in human MCF-7 breast cancer cells and a xenograft mouse model. Treatment with OP significantly induced the proliferation MCF-7 cells in an MTT assay. In addition, the expression of cathepsins B and D was markedly enhanced in MCF-7 cells at both the transcriptional and the translational levels following treatment with E2 or OP up to 48h. These results demonstrated the ability of OP to disrupt normal transcriptional regulation of cathepsins B and D in human breast cancer cells. However, the effects of OP on cell growth or overexpression of cathepsins by inhibiting ER-mediated signaling were abolished by an ER antagonist and siRNA specific for ERα. In conclusion, our findings suggest that OP at 10(-6)M, like E2, may accelerate breast cancer cell proliferation and the expression of cathepsins through an ER-mediated signaling pathway. In addition, the breast cancer cells exposed with OP to a xenograft mouse model were more aggressive according to our histological analysis and showed markedly increased expression of cathepsin B. These effects of mouse model resulted in an increased potential for metastasis in breast cancer. Taken together, we determined that OP can adversely affect human health by promoting cancer proliferation and metastasis through the amplification of cathepsins B and D via the ER-mediated signaling pathway.
23220748	Ticlopidine, a cholestatic liver injury-inducible drug, causes dysfunction of bile formation via diminished biliary secretion of phospholipids: involvement of biliary-excreted glutathione-conjugated ticlopidine metabolites.	The antiplatelet drug, ticlopidine (TIC), reportedly causes cholestatic liver injuries. The present study analyzed the effect of TIC on bile formation, revealing that the biliary secretion of phospholipids was significantly decreased in TIC-administered Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. However, the effect of TIC on biliary phospholipids was not observed in SD rats pretreated with diethylaminoethyl diphenylpropylacetate that inhibits cytochrome P450s (P450), or in Eisai hyperbilirubinemic rats (EHBR) lacking functional multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2/ABCC2). These results suggest that glutathione-conjugated TIC metabolites (TIC-SGs), which were formed in the liver after P450s-mediated metabolism and were excreted extensively into bile by MRP2, mediated the observed alterations of the bile composition. Administration of TIC caused significant liver injuries in SD rats, with decreased biliary phospholipids, but not in EHBR, consistent with the in vitro observation that phospholipid-bile acid-mixed micelles moderated the cytotoxic effects of bile acids. Further analyses revealed that TIC-SGs did not directly inhibit multidrug resistance 3 P-glycoprotein (MDR3/ABCB4)-mediated phosphatidylcholine efflux in vitro. Because the diminished biliary secretion of phospholipids with TIC administration was restored by taurocholate infusion in SD rats, the decreased biliary concentration of bile acids, due to the stimulation of bile acid-independent bile flow driven by TIC-SGs, might have indirectly attenuated phospholipid secretion. In conclusion, extensive biliary excretion of TIC-SGs decreased the biliary secretion of phospholipids, which might have increased the risk of TIC-induced cholestatic liver injury.
7582530	Characterization of an alpha 1D-adrenoceptor mediating the contractile response of rat aorta to noradrenaline.	1. The affinities of a number of alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists were determined by displacement of [3H]-prazosin binding from cloned human alpha 1A-adrenoceptors (previously designated cloned alpha 1c subtype), alpha 1B alpha 1D and rat alpha 1D-adrenoceptors, stably expressed in rat-1 fibroblasts. Functional affinity estimates for these compounds were also determined from noradrenaline-mediated contractions of rat aorta. 2. BMY 7378 displayed high affinity for cloned human alpha 1D-adrenoceptors (pKi = 8.2 +/- 0.10) and was selective over alpha 1A (pKi = 6.2 +/- 0.10) and alpha 1B subtypes (6.7 +/- 0.11). WB 4101, benoxathian and phentolamine displayed high affinity for alpha 1A and alpha 1D adrenoceptors compared to the alpha 1B subtype. Spiperone displayed high affinity and selectivity for alpha 1B adrenoceptors (pKi 8.8 +/- 0.16). 5-Methyl-urapidil was selective for cloned alpha 1A adrenoceptors. 3. Comparative binding affinities (pKi) for compounds at cloned human and rat1D adrenoceptors were almost identical (r = 0.99, slope = 1.08). 4. Prazosin, doxazosin and 5-methyl-urapidil were potent, competitive antagonists of noradrenaline-mediated contractions of rat aorta (pA2 values of 9.8, 8.8 and 7.8 respectively). The selective alpha 1D antagonist BMY 7378 was also a potent antagonist on rat aorta (pKB = 8.3 +/- 0.1) but the interaction of this compound was not consistent with competitive antagonism at a single population of receptors. 5. Functional affinities for compounds determined against noradrenaline-mediated contractions of rat aorta correlated well with binding affinities at cloned alpha 1D-adrenoceptors (r = 0.96), but not with alpha 1A (r = 0.61) or alpha 1B (r = 0.46) subtypes. 6. Noradrenaline-mediated contractions of rat aorta were sensitive to the alkylating effects of chlorethylclonidine (CEC). CEC (10 microM) caused a small rightward shift in the noradrenaline concentration-response curve. CEC at 100 microM caused a further shift and suppression of the maximum response to noradrenaline.7. The results of this study suggest that noradrenaline predominantly, but not exclusively, mediates contraction of rat aorta through the activation of an alphalD-adrenoceptor.
7969082	Selectivity of agonists for cloned alpha 1-adrenergic receptor subtypes.	The potencies and intrinsic activities of agonists in activating cloned alpha 1-adrenergic receptor (AR) subtypes were compared. The hamster alpha 1B-, bovine alpha 1C-, or rat alpha 1A/D-ARs were expressed at high levels in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Catecholamines and phenylethylamines, but not lower efficacy agonists, were more potent in inhibiting radioligand binding to the expressed alpha 1A/D subtype than to the alpha 1B or alpha 1C subtypes; this selectivity remained in the presence of different buffers, nucleotides, and cations. Activation of all three subtypes caused substantial increases in [3H]inositol phosphate formation in cells grown in 96-well plates. Pretreatment with phenoxybenzamine decreased maximal responses to norepinephrine (NE) with only small decreases in apparent potency, suggesting similar small receptor reserves for all three subtypes. The catecholamines NE, epinephrine, and 6-fluoro-NE were full agonists with similar potencies at the three subtypes; alpha-methyl-NE was also a full agonist but was about 20-fold less potent at alpha 1B-ARs than at alpha 1C- or alpha 1A/D-ARs. Phenylephrine had similar potencies at all three subtypes but gave a submaximal response at alpha 1B-ARs. Methoxamine was a full agonist at alpha 1C- and alpha 1A/D-ARs, with about 20-fold greater potency at the alpha 1C subtype, but showed lower intrinsic activity at alpha 1B-ARs. A number of imidazolines, amidephrine, and SKF 89748 had substantial intrinsic activity at alpha 1C-ARs but little or no intrinsic activity at the other two subtypes. We conclude that the potencies of many agonists in competing for radioligand binding sites are related to their potencies in activating functional responses but that this relationship is not the same for all subtypes. NE and epinephrine activate all three cloned alpha 1-AR subtypes with similar potencies and intrinsic activities, but many widely used agonists show significant selectivity for different alpha 1-AR subtypes.
16305240	Co-C bond activation in methylmalonyl-CoA mutase by stabilization of the post-homolysis product Co2+ cobalamin.	"Despite decades of research, the mechanism by which coenzyme B12 (adenosylcobalamin, AdoCbl)-dependent enzymes promote homolytic cleavage of the cofactor's Co-C bond to initiate catalysis has continued to elude researchers. In this work, we utilized magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy to explore how the electronic structure of the reduced B12 cofactor (i.e., the post-homolysis product Co2+ Cbl) is modulated by the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. Our data reveal a fairly uniform stabilization of the Co 3d orbitals relative to the corrin pi/pi*-based molecular orbitals when Co2+ Cbl is bound to the enzyme active site, particularly in the presence of substrate. Contrastingly, our previous studies (Brooks, A. J.; Vlasie, M.; Banerjee, R.; Brunold, T. C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004, 126, 8167-8180.) showed that when AdoCbl is bound to the MMCM active site, no enzymatic perturbation of the Co3+ Cbl electronic structure occurs, even in the presence of substrate (analogues). Collectively, these observations provide direct evidence that enzymatic Co-C bond activation involves stabilization of the post-homolysis product, Co2+ Cbl, rather than destabilization of the Co3+ Cbl ""ground"" state."
17275903	Hypoxia and lactate production in trophoblast cells.	The etiology of preeclampsia is unknown but is thought to be related to hypoxia in the placenta. We previously reported that the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) has increased activity and gene expression in placentas from preeclamptic pregnancies [Tsoi SCM, Zheng J, Xu F, Kay HH. Differential expression of lactate dehydrogenase isozymes (LDH) in human placenta with high expression of LDH-A(4) isozyme in the endothelial cells of pre-eclampsia villi. Placenta 2001;22:317-22]. LDH is responsible for pyruvate conversion to lactate through glycolysis. In this study, we further investigated the role of hypoxia in primary trophoblast cells and a cultured cell line, JEG3 cells, to obtain a better understanding of how it affects the activities of lactate dehydrogenase, lactate production and regulatory genes, as a possible model for preeclampsia. Primary trophoblast cells and JEG3 cells were cultured under 1% oxygen. At 6, 12 and 24h, cells were analyzed for LDHA and LDHB isozyme activities, mRNA and protein expression compared to standard culture conditions. Lactate was measured from cell medium. The hypoxia inducible transcription factor (HIF-1alpha) protein expression was confirmed by western blot. Two lactate transporters (MCT1 and MCT4) mRNA and protein expression were also studied under hypoxia. Finally, lactate was measured in plasma obtained from patients with severe preeclampsia. Under hypoxic conditions, LDHA mRNA is increased in primary trophoblast cells and JEG3 cells. The HIF-1alpha protein expression is higher in hypoxia-treated JEG3 cells than control. LDHA isozyme activity and its protein expression are increased most significantly at 24h of culture under hypoxia. However, LDHB protein is unchanged while its mRNA is decreased. Lactate secretion from JEG3 cells under hypoxia is increased, as is the lactate levels in the plasma from preeclampsia patients. Of the two lactate transporters studied, MCT4 mRNA and protein level are increased under hypoxia. Our findings support the role of hypoxia in inducing HIF-1alpha activity in trophoblasts and increasing LDH transcription as well as its activity. Higher levels of lactate are produced and secreted which may contribute to the higher lactate levels in plasma of preeclamptic patients. These mechanisms may be important in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia.
23178164	Constant light disrupts the circadian rhythm of steroidogenic proteins in the rat adrenal gland.	The circadian rhythm of corticosterone (CORT) secretion from the adrenal cortex is regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which is entrained to the light-dark cycle. Since the circadian CORT rhythm is associated with circadian expression of the steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein, we investigated the 24h pattern of hormonal secretion (ACTH and CORT), steroidogenic gene expression (StAR, SF-1, DAX1 and Nurr77) and the expression of genes involved in ACTH signalling (MC2R and MRAP) in rats entrained to a normal light-dark cycle. We found that circadian changes in ACTH and CORT were associated with the circadian expression of all gene targets; with SF-1, Nurr77 and MRAP peaking in the evening, and DAX1 and MC2R peaking in the morning. Since disruption of normal SCN activity by exposure to constant light abolishes the circadian rhythm of CORT in the rat, we also investigated whether the AM-PM variation of our target genes was also disrupted in rats exposed to constant light conditions for 5weeks. We found that the disruption of the AM-PM variation of ACTH and CORT secretion in rats exposed to constant light was accompanied by a loss of AM-PM variation in StAR, SF-1 and DAX1, and a reversed AM-PM variation in Nurr77, MC2R and MRAP. Our data suggest that circadian expression of StAR is regulated by the circadian expression of nuclear receptors and proteins involved in both ACTH signalling and StAR transcription. We propose that ACTH regulates the secretion of CORT via the circadian control of steroidogenic gene pathways that become dysregulated under the influence of constant light.
23017402	Phytochemical profile of Rosmarinus officinalis and Salvia officinalis extracts and correlation to their antioxidant and anti-proliferative activity.	The goal of this study was to monitor the anti-proliferative activity of Rosmarinus officinalis and Salvia officinalis extracts against cancer cells and to correlate this activity with their phytochemical profiles using liquid chromatography/diode array detection/electrospray ion trap tandem mass spectrometry (LC/DAD/ESI-MS(n)). For the quantitative estimation of triterpenic acids in the crude extracts an NMR based methodology was used and compared with the HPLC measurements, both applied for the first time, for the case of betulinic acid. Both extracts exerted cytotoxic activity through dose-dependent impairment of viability and mitochondrial activity of rat insulinoma m5F (RINm5F) cells. Decrease of RINm5F viability was mediated by nitric oxide (NO)-induced apoptosis. Importantly, these extracts potentiated NO and TNF-α release from macrophages therefore enhancing their cytocidal action. The rosemary extract developed more pronounced antioxidant, cytotoxic and immunomodifying activities, probably due to the presence of betulinic acid and a higher concentration of carnosic acid in its phytochemical profile.
20557886	The androgen derivative 5alpha-androstane-3beta,17beta-diol inhibits tumor necrosis factor alpha and lipopolysaccharide induced inflammatory response in human endothelial cells and in mice aorta.	BACKGROUND: An increasing body of evidence suggests that testosterone may exert beneficial effects against the development of atherosclerosis. These effects are thought to be the consequence of its conversion into estradiol and the activation of the estrogen receptors; however a direct role of androgens, such as dihydrotestosterone, has also been proposed. More recently, it has been shown that the transformation of the dihydrotestosterone to 5alpha-androstane-3alpha,17beta-diol (3alpha-diol) and 5alpha-androstane-3beta,17beta-diol (3beta-Adiol), generates two molecules unable to bind the androgen receptor, but with a high affinity for the estrogen receptors (ERs) in particular the beta isoform. As the actions of testosterone may result from the balance between androgenic and estrogenic molecules originating from its catabolism, we investigated the effects of the 3beta-Adiol on inflammatory responses in vitro in human endothelial cells and ex vivo in mice aortas. METHODS AND RESULTS: 3beta-Adiol reverts the pro-inflammatory gene expression pattern induced by TNF-alpha in HUVECs as determined by a cDNA microrray approach. Q-real-time PCR and protein array approaches confirmed that TNF-alpha-induced ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and ELAM-1 as well as MCP-1 and IL-6 induction was affected upon 3beta-Adiol pre-incubation. ICI 182780, an estrogen receptor antagonist and R,R-THC, an estrogen receptor beta antagonist, counteracted the effect of 3beta-Adiol while bicalutamide, an androgen receptor antagonist, had minor effects. 3beta-Adiol exerted a similar action on macrophages. Finally in castrated male mice, 3beta-Adiol significantly counteracted the LPS mediated mRNA induction of IL-6, ELAM-1and PECAM-1 in the aortas. CONCLUSION: 3beta-Adiol reverts in vitro the TNF-alpha and LPS induced pro-inflammatory activation of endothelial cells and macrophages. 3beta-Adiol in vivo modulates the inflammatory response induced by LPS in the arterial vascular wall.
23532932	Bioimaging real-time PXR-dependent mdr1a gene regulation in mdr1a.fLUC reporter mice.	The MDR1 gene encodes P-glycoprotein, a transmembrane drug efflux transporter that confers multidrug resistance in cancer cells and affects drug pharmacokinetics by virtue of its expression in the liver, kidney, and colon. Nuclear receptors SXR and CAR are possible master regulators of xenobiotic-inducible MDR1 expression in drug processing organs, but the mechanism of MDR1 regulation has yet to be directly demonstrated in vivo. Moreover, it has previously been impossible to determine the sustained or cumulative effect of repeated doses of xenobiotics on in vivo MDR1 expression. We previously reported a mouse model containing firefly luciferase (fLUC) knocked into the mdr1a genomic locus, allowing non-invasive bioimaging of intestinal mdr1a gene expression in live animals. In the current study, we crossed mdr1a.fLUC mice into the pxr knockout (pxr(-/-)) genetic background and injected mice with pregnenolone-16α-carbonitrile (PCN), a strong PXR ligand, and two therapeutically relevant taxanes, paclitaxel and docetaxel. All three agents induced mdr1a.fLUC expression (bioluminescence), but only PCN and docetaxel appeared to act primarily via PXR. Luminescence returned to baseline by 24-48 hrs after drug injection and was re-inducible over two additional rounds of drug dosing in pxr(+/+) mice. TCPOBOP, a CAR ligand, modestly induced mdr1a.fLUC in pxr(+/+) and pxr(-/-) strains, consistent with CAR's minor role in mdr1a regulation. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the mdr1a.fLUC bioimaging model can capture changes in mdr1 gene expression under conditions of repeated xenobiotic treatment in vivo and that it can be used to probe the mechanism of gene regulation in response to different xenobiotic agents.
18973287	Structural requirements for eszopiclone and zolpidem binding to the gamma-aminobutyric acid type-A (GABAA) receptor are different.	The sleep-aids zolpidem and eszopiclone exert their effects by binding to and modulating gamma-aminobutyric acid type-A receptors (GABA(A)Rs), but little is known about the structural requirements for their actions. We made 24 cysteine mutations in the benzodiazepine (BZD) binding site of alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2) GABA(A)Rs and measured zolpidem, eszopiclone, and BZD-site antagonist binding. Mutations in gamma(2)loop D and alpha(1)loops A and B altered the affinity of all ligands tested, indicating that these loops are important for BZD pocket structural integrity. In contrast, gamma(2)loop E and alpha(1)loop C mutations differentially affected ligand affinity, suggesting that these loops are important for ligand selectivity. In agreement with our mutagenesis data, eszopiclone docking yielded a single model stabilized by several hydrogen bonds. Zolpidem docking yielded three equally populated orientations with few polar interactions, suggesting that unlike eszopiclone, zolpidem relies more on shape recognition of the binding pocket than on specific residue interactions and may explain why zolpidem is highly alpha(1)- and gamma(2)-subunit selective.
23416131	Antitumor and immunomodulatory activity of a water-soluble low molecular weight polysaccharide from Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill.	A water-soluble low molecular weight polysaccharide (SCPP11) was extracted and purified using DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex G-100 column from Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill. Its in vivo and in vitro antitumor and immunomodulatory activity were investigated. The results showed that SCPP11 with a molecular weight of 3.4×10(3)Da exhibited indirect cyctotoxic activity against tumor cells in vitro, but could significantly inhibit the growth of Heps cells in vivo at dose of 50mg/kg, and its inhibition rate is higher than that in the positive group. Moreover, SCPP11 could ameliorate the hematological and biochemical parameters to almost normal and no significant changes in organ weight, and could increase the body weight. In addition, SCPP11 (at 50mg/kg) could also increased in thymus indexes as well as IL-2 and TNF-α levels in serum in vivo and significantly enhance the phagocytosis activity and the productions of NO of RAW264.7 in vitro. The results indicated that antitumor properties of SCPP11 might be achieved by improving immune response. It could be explored as a potential adjuvant against cancer used in the health food and pharmaceutical therapy.
23541637	Aldosterone-induced ENaC and basal Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase trafficking via protein kinase D1-phosphatidylinositol 4-kinaseIIIβ trans Golgi signalling in M1 cortical collecting duct cells.	Aldosterone regulates Na(+) transport in the distal nephron through multiple mechanisms that include the transcriptional control of epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase subunits. Aldosterone also induces the rapid phosphorylation of Protein Kinase D1 (PKD1). PKD isoforms regulate protein trafficking, by the control of vesicle fission from the trans Golgi network (TGN) through activation of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinaseIIIβ (PI4KIIIβ). We report rapid ENaCγ translocation to the plasma membrane after 30min aldosterone treatment in polarized M1 cortical collecting duct cells, which was significantly impaired in PKD1 shRNA-mediated knockdown cells. In PKD1-deficient cells, the ouabain-sensitive current was significantly reduced and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase α and β subunits showed aberrant localization. PKD1 and PI4KIIIβ localize to the TGN, and aldosterone induced an interaction between PKD1 and PI4KIIIβ following aldosterone treatment. This study reveals a novel mechanism for rapid regulation of ENaC and the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, via directed trafficking through PKD1-PI4KIIIβ signalling at the level of the TGN.
23153057	Assessment of cytochrome P450 (1A2, 2B6, 2C9 and 3A4) induction in cryopreserved human hepatocytes cultured in 48-well plates using the cocktail strategy.	1. A fast, straightforward and cost-effective assay was validated for the assessment of CYP induction in cryopreserved human hepatocytes cultured in 48-well plates. The cocktail strategy (in situ incubation) was used to assess the induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 by using the recommended probe substrate, i.e. phenacetin, bupropion, diclofenac and midazolam, respectively. 2. Cryopreserved human hepatocytes were treated for 72 h with prototypical reference inducers, β-naphthoflavone (25 µM), phenobarbital (500 µM) and rifampicin (10 µM) as positive controls for CYP induction. The use of a cocktail strategy has been validated and compared to the classical approach (single incubation). The need of using phase II inhibitor (salicylamide) in CYP induction assay was also investigated. 3. By using three different batches of cryopreserved human hepatocytes and our conditions of incubations, we showed that there was no relevant drug-drug interaction using the cocktail strategy. The same conclusions were observed when a broad range of enzyme activity has to be assessed (wide range of reference inducers, i.e. EC50-Emax experiment). In addition, the interassay reproducibility assessment showed that the day-to-day variability was minimal. 4. In summary, the study showed that the conditions used (probe substrates, concentration of probe substrate and time of incubation) for the cocktail approach were appropriate for investigations of CYP induction potential of new chemical entities. In addition, it was also clear that the use of salicylamide in the incubation media was not mandatory and could generate drug-drug interactions. For this reason, we recommend to not use salicylamide in CYP induction assay.
12566304	Sulindac sulfide inhibits epidermal growth factor-induced phosphorylation of extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 and Bad in human colon cancer cells.	Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs including sulindac are promising chemopreventive agents for colorectal cancer. Sulindac and selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors cause regression of colonic polyps in familial polyposis patients. Sulindac induces apoptotic cell death in cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. In tumor cells, activation of extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 results in phosphorylation of several ERK1/2 effectors, including the proapoptotic protein Bad. Phosphorylation of Ser112 by ERK1/2 inactivates Bad and protects the tumor cell from apoptosis. Sulindac metabolites and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs selectively inhibit ERK1/2 phosphorylation in human colon cancer cells. In this study we show that epidermal growth factor (EGF) strongly induces phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Bad in HT29 colon cancer cells. EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK and Bad is blocked by pretreatment with U0126, a selective MAP kinase kinase (MKK)1/2 inhibitor. Similarly, pretreatment with sulindac sulfide blocks the ability of EGF to induce ERK1/2 and Bad phosphorylation, but also down-regulates total Bad but not ERK1/2 protein levels. The ability of sulindac to block ERK1/2 signaling by the EGF receptor may account for at least part of its potent growth-inhibitory effects against cancer cells.
23033256	DNA methylation and histone modification profiles of mouse organic anion transporting polypeptides.	Organic anion transporting polypeptides (rodents, Oatps; human, OATPs) are primarily involved in the transmembrane transportation of a wide range of endogenous and exogenous compounds. Multiple mouse Oatp1 isoforms are closely located on chromosome 6, where each isoform shows distinct tissue distribution; Oatp1b2, Oatp1a6, and Oatp1c1 are expressed exclusively in the liver, kidney, and cerebrum, respectively; Oatp1a1 in the liver and kidney; and Oatp1a4 in the liver and cerebrum. We have identified tissue-dependent differentially methylated region (T-DMR) around the transcriptional start site (TSS) of Oatp1b2, which correlates with its liver-specific expression. Bisulfite sequencing also demonstrated the presence of T-DMRs around the TSS in other Oatp1 genes: CpG dinucleotides at +149 relative to the TSS for Oatp1c1; -48, +101, and +356 for Oatp1a4; -572 and -550 for Oatp1a1; and -122 and +216 for Oatp1a6 were differentially methylated among the liver, kidney, and cerebrum. These methylation profiles were largely consistent with the tissue distribution of Oatp1 mRNAs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that the mRNA expression of Oatp1 genes was accompanied by acetylated histone H3. Human OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 are located on chromosome 12p12 in the OATP1 cluster; both show predominant expression in the liver. These genes also contained T-DMRs that were hypomethylated in the liver, compared with kidney cortex: -511, -411, and +92 relative to the TSS for OATP1B1 and -331, +70, and +73 for OATP1B3. These results suggest that the difference in epigenetic profiles comprising DNA methylation and histone acetylation determines the distinct tissue distribution of Oatp/OATP mRNAs.
22983118	The neurotoxicity of hallucinogenic amphetamines in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons.	"3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ""Ecstasy"") and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine hydrochloride (DOI) are hallucinogenic amphetamines with addictive properties. The hippocampus is involved in learning and memory and seems particularly vulnerable to amphetamine's neurotoxicity. We evaluated the neurotoxicity of DOI and MDMA in primary neuronal cultures of hippocampus obtained from Wistar rat embryos (E-17 to E-19). Mature neurons after 10 days in culture were exposed for 24 or 48 h either to MDMA (100-800 μM) or DOI (10-100 μM). Both the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and the tetrazolium-based (MTT) assays revealed a concentration- and time-dependent neuronal death and mitochondrial dysfunction after exposure to both drugs. Both drugs promoted a significant increase in caspase-8 and caspase-3 activities. At concentrations that produced similar levels of neuronal death, DOI promoted a higher increase in the activity of both caspases than MDMA. In the mitochondrial fraction of neurons exposed 24h to DOI or MDMA, we found a significant increase in the 67 kDa band of apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) by Western blot. Moreover, 24h exposure to DOI promoted an increase in cytochrome c in the cytoplasmatic fraction of neurons. Pre-treatment with an antibody raised against the 5-HT(2A)-receptor (an irreversible antagonist) greatly attenuated neuronal death promoted by 48 h exposure to DOI or MDMA. In conclusion, hallucinogenic amphetamines promoted programmed neuronal death involving both the mitochondria machinery and the extrinsic cell death key regulators. Death was dependent, at least in part, on the stimulation of the 5-HT(2A)-receptors."
23497898	Stability of sunflower 2S albumins and LTP to physiologically relevant in vitro gastrointestinal digestion.	In order for a protein to elicit a systemic allergic response it must reach the circulatory system through the intestinal mucosa as a sufficiently large fragment with adequate structural integrity. Sunflower LTP and 2S albumins (SFA8 and three mixed fractions of Alb1 and Alb2) were digested in simulated gastric fluid (SGF) for 2h and the conditions were then changed to mimic the intestinal environment for a further 2h digestion. The effects of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and emulsification on the digestibility of the proteins were investigated. PC protected all of the proteins studied against both gastric and intestinal digestive enzymes but to different extents. Emulsification of SFA8 resulted in strong protection against digestion, which was further enhanced by the presence of PC in the SGF. These results highlight the importance of considering real food structures such as emulsified systems and also the gastrointestinal environment that proteins are exposed to once consumed when assessing allergenicity.
16772434	Epigenetic regulation of chromatin structure and gene function by biotin.	Covalent modifications of histones are a crucial component of epigenetic events that regulate chromatin structures and gene function. Evidence exists that distinct lysine residues in histones are modified by covalent attachment of the vitamin biotin, catalyzed by biotinidase and holocarboxylase synthetase. Biotinylation of histones appears to be conserved across species. The following biotinylation sites were identified using both MS and enzymatic biotinylation of synthetic peptides: K9, K13, K125, K127, and K129 in histone H2A; K4, K9, and K18 in histone H3; and K8 and K12 in histone H4. Evidence was provided that biotinylated histone H4 is enriched in pericentromeric heterochromatin, and that biotinylation of histone H4 participates in gene silencing, mitotic condensation of chromatin, and the cellular response to DNA damage. Biotinylation of histones is a reversible process and depends on the exogenous biotin supply, but the identities of histone debiotinylases remain uncertain. We propose that some effects of biotin deficiency can be attributed to abnormal chromatin structures.
23332447	Testosterone deficiency induces markedly decreased serum triglycerides, increased small dense LDL, and hepatic steatosis mediated by dysregulation of lipid assembly and secretion in mice fed a high-fat diet.	OBJECTIVE: Although low serum testosterone (T) is associated with metabolic disorders, the mechanism of this association is unclear. The objective of the present study was to investigate the combined effects of T deficiency and a high-fat diet (HFD) on hepatic lipid homeostasis in mice. MATERIALS/METHODS: Orchiectomized (ORX) mice and sham-operated (SHAM) mice were randomly divided into five groups: SHAM mice fed a standard diet (SD), SHAM mice fed HFD, ORX mice fed SD, ORX mice fed HFD, and ORX mice fed HFD with T supplementation. After 4weeks of treatment, we investigated the synthesis and secretion of lipids in the liver and detailed serum lipoprotein profiles in each group. RESULTS: ORX mice fed HFD showed increased hepatic steatosis, markedly decreased serum triglyceride (TG) and TG-VLDL content, and increased serum very small-LDL content. Gene expression analysis revealed that ORX mice fed HFD showed significantly decreased expression of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, lipin-1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α and PPAR-γ coactivator 1-α, and significantly increased sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1, diacylglycerol acyltransferase-2 and fatty acid synthase. Reduction of hepatic AMPK phosphorylation was observed in ORX mice fed HFD. These perturbations in ORX mice fed HFD were normalized to the levels of SHAM mice fed HFD by T supplementation. CONCLUSION: T deficiency is associated with failure of lipid homeostasis mediated by altered expression of genes involved in hepatic assembly and secretion of lipids.
23624852	Ventral tegmental area α6β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors modulate phasic dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens core.	RATIONALE: Phasic dopamine (DA) signaling underlies reward learning. Cholinergic and glutamatergic inputs into the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are crucial for modulating burst firing activity and subsequent phasic DA release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), but the specific VTA nicotinic receptor subtypes that regulate phasic DA release have not been identified. OBJECTIVE: The goal was to determine the role of VTA N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and specific subtypes of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in regulating phasic DA release in the NAc core. METHODS: Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in anesthetized rats was combined with intra-VTA micro-infusion to evaluate the ability of glutamatergic and cholinergic drugs to modulate stimulated phasic DA release in the NAc core. RESULTS: VTA NMDAR blockade with AP-5 decreased, while VTA NMDAR activation with NMDA increased NAc peak phasic DA release. Intra-VTA administration of the nonspecific nAChR antagonist mecamylamine produced a persistent decrease in phasic DA release. Infusion of the α6-selective antagonist α-conotoxin MII (α-ctx MII) produced a robust, but transient decrease in phasic DA, whereas infusion of selective doses of either the α4β2-selective antagonist, dihydro-beta-erythroidine, or the α7 antagonist, methyllycaconitine, had no effect. Co-infusion of AP-5 and α-ctx MII produced a similar phasic DA decrease as either drug alone, with no additive effect. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that VTA α6β2 nAChRs, but not α4β2 or α7 nAChRs, regulate phasic DA release in the NAc core and that VTA α6β2 nAChRs and NMDA receptors act at a common site or target to regulate NAc phasic DA signaling.
23632905	Clock Gene Expression in the Liver of Streptozotocin-induced and Spontaneous Type 1 Diabetic Rats.	Several investigations have shown a relation between diabetes and alterations of the liver circadian clock. We investigated the diurnal expression of clock genes and clock-controlled genes (CCGs) in 3-hour intervals for a 24-h period in the livers of male streptozotocin (STZ)-treated rats, male spontaneous type 1 diabetic LEW.1AR1-iddm (Iddm) rats, and Iddm rats treated for 10 days with insulin. Hepatic mRNA was extracted, and the relative expression of clock genes (Per1, Per2, Bmal1, Clock, Cry1), as well as CCGs (Dbp, E4bp4, RevErbα, Rorα, Pparγ), was analyzed by reverse transcription followed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Diabetic STZ and Iddm rats, as well as insulin-substituted Iddm rats, exhibited a significant diurnal expression pattern of clock genes as determined by Cosinor analysis; however, the MESOR (midline estimating statistic of rhythm) of Bmal1, Per2, and Clock transcript expression was altered in Iddm and insulin-substituted Iddm rats. The hepatic expression of the CCGs Dbp and RevErbα revealed a diurnal rhythm in all investigated groups. Insulin administration to Iddm rats normalized the enhanced MESOR in the expression of Dbp, RevErbα, and E4bp4 to the levels of normoglycemic controls. Cosinor analysis indicated no diurnal rhythm of Pparγ expression in the livers of diabetic STZ or Iddm rats or in those of insulin-substituted Iddm rats. Also, insulin substitution could not reverse the decreased MESOR of Pparγ expression in Iddm rats. In consequence of the diabetic disease, changes in the expression of clock genes and CCGs suggest alterations in the hepatic peripheral clock mechanism.
11258648	Effects of topical budesonide treatment on glucocorticoid receptor mRNA down-regulation and cytokine patterns in nasal polyps.	UNLABELLED: The effects of a topically applied corticosteroid, budesonide, on the expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA and regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine patterns in patients with nasal polyps were evaluated. All patients were eligible for surgical polypectomy, and a majority of them had been treated with nasal steroids. Patients were given 400 microg b.i.d. (group A, n = 11), 200 microg b.i.d. (group B, n = 10), or no treatment (group C, n = 15) during two months before polypectomy. Morning serum cortisol was analyzed on the day of surgery. Surgically removed polyps were taken for analysis of GR mRNA expression by solution hybridization. Remaining tissue was cryostat-sectioned, whereafter quantification of the cytokines interleukin 1beta, interleukin 2, interleukin 4, interleukin 5, interleukin 6, interleukin 10, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interferon gamma was made by immunohistochemistry and digitized image analysis. No significant differences among the three groups were found for any of the parameters investigated. CONCLUSION: nasal polyps do not respond with down-regulation of GR mRNA or cytokines following topical corticosteroid treatment. The proposed corticosteroid resistance may be inherent, or induced by a change of local tissue bioavailability.
11245456	Pharmacological inhibition of fatty acid synthase activity produces both cytostatic and cytotoxic effects modulated by p53.	Fatty acid synthetic metabolism is abnormally elevated in tumor cells, and pharmacological inhibitors of the anabolic enzyme fatty acid synthase (FAS), including the natural product cerulenin and the novel synthetic compound c75, are selective inhibitors of tumor cell growth. We have recently reported that these two FAS inhibitors both produce rapid, potent inhibition of DNA replication and S-phase progression in human cancer cells, as well as apoptotic death. Here we report an additional characterization of the cellular response to FAS inhibition. RKO colon carcinoma cells were selected for study because they undergo little apoptosis within the first 24 h after FAS inhibition. Instead, RKO cells exhibited a biphasic stress response with a transient accumulation in S and G2 at 4 and 8 h that corresponds to a marked reduction in cyclin A- and B1-associated kinase activities, and then by accumulation of p53 and p21 proteins at 16 and 24 h and growth arrest in G1 and G2. The response of RKO cells to FAS inhibition resembled a genotoxic stress response, but DNA damage did not appear to be an important downstream effect of FAS inhibition, because none was detected using the single cell gel electrophoresis assay (comet assay) to assess DNA damage. p53 function is probably important in protecting RKO cells from FAS inhibition because, similar to many other tumor lines, RKO cells expressing a dominant negative mutant p53 gene underwent extensive apoptosis within 24 h after FAS inhibition. Sensitization of cells to FAS inhibitors by the loss of p53 raises the possibility that these agents may be clinically useful against malignancies carrying p53 mutations. Whereas induction of apoptosis appeared related to accumulation of the substrate, malonyl-CoA, after FAS inhibition, the cytostatic effects were independent of malonyl-CoA accumulation and may have resulted from product depletion.
3004987	Purification and characterization of calcitonin receptors in rat kidney membranes by covalent cross-linking techniques.	We have characterized the binding parameters of renal receptors (Scatchard analysis revealed the presence of two binding sites: site I, Ka1 = 1.29 X 10(9) M-1, number of binding sites = 9.9 X 10(6)/micrograms protein; site II, Ka2 = 0.93 X 10(8) M-1, number of binding sites = 4.27 X 10(8)/micrograms protein) and studied the effect of solubilization. The high-affinity sites are preserved during affinity chromatography and the process results in a 6080-fold purification of those sites. The lower-affinity sites are also preserved but the overall purification factor is about 40% lower than that obtained using molecular sieving. The purification of the renal calcitonin receptor by molecular sieving (Sephacryl S-200) is accompanied by total loss of the high-affinity site; however, the low-affinity site is enriched over 1642-fold. Binding parameters were obtained for the purified fractions. Synthetic salmon calcitonin was also bound to renal membranes using the bifunctional reagent disuccinimidyl suberate and photo-affinity cross-linking using hydroxysuccinimidyl azidobenzonate reagent. Cross-linked receptor eluted in the same volume as solubilized membranes specifically binding salmon calcitonin (S-200 chromatography). Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of purified fractions showed several protein bands with apparent molecular masses ranging from 18 000 Da to 100 000 Da in the presence or absence of a reducing agent (2-mercaptoethanol). Autoradiography of polyacrylamide gels of cross-linked calcitonin receptor showed only three protein bands specifically binding salmon calcitonin. Their molecular masses were 70 000 Da, 40 000 Da and 33 000 Da respectively. The 40 000-Da molecule represents a major band (47% total binding species). This suggests that these three proteins are the principal components of the calcitonin receptor and that S-S bonds are not involved in the assembly of the receptor subunits.
23380305	Selective brain region activation by histamine H3 receptor antagonist/inverse agonist ABT-239 enhances acetylcholine and histamine release and increases c-Fos expression.	Histamine axons originate solely from the tuberomamillary nucleus (TMN) to innervate almost all brain regions. This feature is consistent with a function for histamine over a host of physiological processes, including regulation of appetite, body temperature, cognitive processes, pain perception and sleep-wake cycle. An important question is whether these diverse physiological roles are served by different histamine neuronal subpopulations. Here we report that systemic administration of the non-imidazole histamine H3 receptor antagonist 4-(2-{2-[(2R)-2-methylpyrrolidinyl]ethyl}-benzofuran-5-yl)benzonitrile (ABT-239, 3 mg/kg) increased c-Fos expression dose-dependently in rat cortex and nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM) but not in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) nor striatum, and augmented acetylcholine and histamine release from rat prefrontal cortex. To further understand functional histaminergic pathways in the brain, dual-probe microdialysis was used to pharmacologically block H3 receptors in the TMN. Perfusion of the TMN with ABT-239 (10 μM) increased histamine release from the TMN, NBM, and cortex, but not from the striatum or NAcc. When administered locally, ABT-239 increased histamine release from the NBM, but not from the NAcc. Systemic as well as intra-TMN administration of ABT-239 increased c-Fos expression in the NBM, and cortex, but not in the striatum or NAcc. Thus, as defined by their sensitivity to ABT-239, histaminergic neurons establish distinct pathways according to their terminal projections, and can differentially modulate neurotransmitter release in a brain region-specific manner. This implies independent functions of subsets of histamine neurons according to their terminal projections, with relevant consequences for the development of specific compounds that affect only subsets of histamine neurones, thus increasing target specificity.
10726310	[Plasminogen binding with decapeptide and polypeptide fragments of streptokinase].	The plasminogen binding with streptokinase decapeptides, modeling the primary structure of molecule, and chymotryptic fragments of streptokinase have been investigated. The immunoenzymatic assay has shown that plasminogen binds to all streptokinase fragments with the decreasing affinity in the set of fragments: 36 > 30 > 17 > 7 > 11 kDa. Location of the binding sites in streptokinase primary structure was performed using the immobilized decapeptides on plastic pins adopted to IEA. In the presence of 10 mM 6-aminohexanoic acid 11 sites for human Glu- and mini-plasminogens, pig and bovine plasminogens binding have been found. They were of the same location for human, bovine and pig plasminogens. 3 sites were located in plasminogen alpha-domain--T43-A72, N113-T126, Q133-V158, 5 sites in beta-domain--T163-L188, A203-S222, Q239-I264, Y275-L294, T315-L340, and 3 sites in gamma-domain--T361-R362, N377-E392, T397-N410. Participation of linear part of streptokinase polypeptide chain in plasminogen--streptokinase complex formation is suggested.
23261051	Cell-cycle and DNA damage regulation of the DNA mismatch repair protein Msh2 occurs at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level.	DNA mismatch repair during replication is a conserved process essential for maintaining genomic stability. Mismatch repair is also implicated in cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis after DNA damage. Because yeast and human mismatch repair systems are well conserved, we have employed the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to understand the regulation and function of the mismatch repair gene MSH2. Using a luciferase-based transcriptional reporter, we defined a 218-bp region upstream of MSH2 that contains cell-cycle and DNA damage responsive elements. The 5' end of the MSH2 transcript was mapped by primer extension and was found to encode a small upstream open reading frame (uORF). Mutagenesis of the uORF start codon or of the uORF stop codon, which creates a continuous reading frame with MSH2, increased Msh2 steady-state protein levels ∼2-fold. Furthermore, we found that the cell-cycle transcription factors Swi6, Swi4, and Mbp1-along with SCB/MCB cell-cycle binding sites upstream of MSH2-are all required for full basal expression of MSH2. Mutagenesis of the cell-cycle boxes resulted in a minor reduction in basal Msh2 levels and a 3-fold defect in mismatch repair. Disruption of the cell-cycle boxes also affected growth in a DNA polymerase-defective strain background where mismatch repair is essential, particularly in the presence of the DNA damaging agent methyl methane sulfonate (MMS). Promoter replacements conferring constitutive expression of MSH2 revealed that the transcriptional induction in response to MMS is required to maintain induced levels of Msh2. Turnover experiments confirmed an elevated rate of degradation in the presence of MMS. Taken together, the data show that the DNA damage regulation of Msh2 occurs at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. The transcriptional and translational control elements identified are conserved in mammalian cells, underscoring the use of yeast as a model system to examine the regulation of MSH2.
23274771	NF-κB-associated mechanisms underlying the response of embryonic cells to Doxorubicin.	The involvement of NF-κB in the regulation of teratogen-induced apoptosis has not been established yet. Therefore, we tried to assess the involvement of the p65 subunit of NF-κB in the embryonic response to the anti-cancer drug Doxorubicin (DOX). Thus, exposure of p65 knockout (p65(-/-)) or wild type (WT) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to DOX resulted in a decrease in cell survival, culture density and cell proliferation, which was found to be more prominent in p65(-/-) MEFs. Those phenomena were accompanied by a DOX-induced increase in the proportion of apoptotic cells, which was demonstrated only in p65(-/-) cells and a G2/M arrest, which was found to be more prominent in WT cells. Furthermore, DOX-treated WT and p65(-/-) MEFs differed in their expression of various apoptosis-associated molecules, when the former demonstrated a decrease in the percentage of p65-positive and a more prominent decrease in the percentage of p53-positive cells, while a decreased percentage of IκBα-positive and a more prominent decrease in the percentage of bcl-2-positive cells was detected among the latter. The fact that the response of the cells to the teratogen was clearly p65-dependent implicates this molecule to be involved in the response of the embryonic cells to DOX.
23146754	Effects of arsenite in astrocytes on neuronal signaling transduction.	The main purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that arsenite induces neurotoxicity via effects on astrocytes. Astrocytes were exposed to 0, 5 or 10 μM arsenite in medium for 24 h, and then astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) was collected after incubation with fresh medium for 6 h. Primary neuron cultures were divided into four groups due to ACM, which were neurons without ACM exposure (group I) and neurons exposed to ACM from 0, 5 or 10 μM arsenite treated astrocytes (group II-IV). Protein expression of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NR1, NR2A, NR2B), calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and adenylate cyclase (AC) in neurons were measured after incubation with ACM for 4, 8 or 12 h. Morphological changes and synaptic formation were observed after a 72 h-incubation with ACM. Compared to group II, synaptic formation and protein expression of NR2A, NR2B, CaMKII and AC in group III and IV were significantly suppressed. Moreover, synaptic formation and protein expression of CaMKII and AC in group II were significantly enhanced when compared with group I. Taken together, findings from this study suggested that arsenic in astrocytes might impair synaptic formation through disturbing astrocytic effects on neuronal signal transduction.
23178381	Aspidin PB, a phloroglucinol derivative, induces apoptosis in human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells by modulating PI3K/Akt/GSK3β pathway.	Aspidin PB, a phloroglucinol derivative isolated from Dryopteris fragrans (L.) Schott, has been previously reported to exert high biological activities. In the present study, we analyzed the apoptotic mechanisms of aspidin PB on human hepatoma cell line, HepG2. Initially, aspidin PB was shown to inhibit the growth of HepG2 cells in a time and dose-dependent manner. After treatment with aspidin PB for 72 h, 48 h and 24 h using MTT assay, the IC(50) values were 10.59 μM, 20.86 μM and 46.59 μM, respectively. Aspidin PB was capable to induce apoptosis, as measured by mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), acridine orange (AO) staining and propidium iodide (PI)/annexin V-FITC double staining. To further explore the signaling pathway of aspidin PB-mediated apoptosis, we examined PI3K/Akt related proteins. Western blot analysis revealed that aspidin PB inhibited PI3K expression, phosphorylation of Ser473 Akt and Ser9 GSK3β followed by up-regulation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs activated gene-1 (NAG-1) expression. Similarly, the effects of aspidin PB on PI3K, Akt, GSK3β, NAG-1 expression were abolished by treatment with the PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin. Taken together, our data suggested that the PI3K/Akt/GSK3β signal pathway may represent one of the major mechanisms of the effects of aspidin PB on human hepatocarcinoma cells.
23468426	The interaction of isopenicillin N synthase with homologated substrate analogues δ-(L-α-aminoadipoyl)-L-homocysteinyl-D-Xaa characterised by protein crystallography.	Isopenicillin N synthase (IPNS) converts the linear tripeptide δ-(L-α-aminoadipoyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine (ACV) into bicyclic isopenicillin N (IPN) in the central step in the biosynthesis of penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. Solution-phase incubation experiments have shown that IPNS turns over analogues with a diverse range of side chains in the third (valinyl) position of the substrate, but copes less well with changes in the second (cysteinyl) residue. IPNS thus converts the homologated tripeptides δ-(L-α-aminoadipoyl)-L-homocysteinyl-D-valine (AhCV) and δ-(L-α-aminoadipoyl)-L-homocysteinyl-D-allylglycine (AhCaG) into monocyclic hydroxy-lactam products; this suggests that the additional methylene unit in these substrates induces conformational changes that preclude second ring closure after initial lactam formation. To investigate this and solution-phase results with other tripeptides δ-(L-α-aminoadipoyl)-L-homocysteinyl-D-Xaa, we have crystallised AhCV and δ-(L-α-aminoadipoyl)-L-homocysteinyl-D-S-methylcysteine (AhCmC) with IPNS and solved crystal structures for the resulting complexes. The IPNS:Fe(II):AhCV complex shows diffuse electron density for several regions of the substrate, revealing considerable conformational freedom within the active site. The substrate is more clearly resolved in the IPNS:Fe(II):AhCmC complex, by virtue of thioether coordination to iron. AhCmC occupies two distinct conformations, both distorted relative to the natural substrate ACV, in order to accommodate the extra methylene group in the second residue. Attempts to turn these substrates over within crystalline IPNS using hyperbaric oxygenation give rise to product mixtures.
7825060	Adenylosuccinate synthetase: a dominant amplifiable genetic marker in mammalian cells.	Adenylosuccinate synthetase (AdSS) functions at the branchpoint of purine nucleotide metabolism leading to the synthesis of AMP. The enzyme is inhibited by a metabolite of alanosine, an aspartic acid analog that is highly cytotoxic for most cells. We show here that it is possible to use alanosine selection to isolate from a population of transformants those cells having the highest levels of AdSS activity resulting from uptake and expression of AdSS minigenes. Transformants isolated in this way were selected for resistance to even higher concentrations of alanosine and resulted in the isolation of cells with highly amplified copies of the transfected AdSS minigenes. We demonstrated that nonselectable genes can be cotransferred and coamplified with AdSS minigenes. These findings indicate that AdSS minigenes can be used as dominant amplifiable genetic markers in mammalian cells.
2270485	Zinc mediation of the binding of human growth hormone to the human prolactin receptor.	"Human growth hormone (hGH) elicits a diverse set of biological activities including lactation that derives from binding to the prolactin (PRL) receptor. The binding affinity of hGH for the extracellular binding domain of the hPRL receptor (hPRLbp) was increased about 8000-fold by addition of 50 micromolar ZnCl2. Zinc was not required for binding of hGH to the hGH binding protein (hGHbp) or for binding of hPRL to the hPRLbp. Other divalent metal ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, Cu2+, Mn2+, and Co2+) at physiological concentrations did not support such strong binding. Scatchard analysis indicated a stoichiometry of one Zn2+ per hGH.hPRLbp complex. Mutational analysis showed that a cluster of three residues (His18, His21, and Glu174) in hGH and His188 from the hPRLbp (conserved in all PRL receptors but not GH receptors) are probable Zn2+ ligands. This polypeptide hormone.receptor ""zinc sandwich"" provides a molecular mechanism to explain why nonprimate GHs are not lactogenic and offers a molecular link between zinc deficiency and its association with altered functions of hGH."
22677475	Effect of tetrabrombisphenol A on induction of apoptosis in the testes and changes in expression of selected testicular genes in CD1 mice.	Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) is a substance widely used in industry as a flame retardant. TBBPA was found in the environment and was detected even in the human body. The effect of this chemical was observed in different cell lines in vitro and it is supposed that TBBPA may affect various hormonal systems in vivo. In this study we examined the effect of TBBPA on the reproductive parameters of two generations of outbred mice in vivo. Experimental and control animals of F1 generation were bred in various conditions to enable evaluation of the possible trans-generational effect. An increased incidence of apoptosis in the testes and changes in the morphometry of seminiferous tubules was detected in the experimental animals. In addition, changes in the expression pattern of selected genes encoding proteins that play an important role during spermatogenesis were observed. In contrast, sperm quality and reproduction were not affected by TBBPA.
23500538	Analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry of sterols and oxysterols in brain of the newborn Dhcr7(Δ3-5/T93M) mouse: A model of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome.	In this study the sterol and oxysterol profile of newborn brain from the Dhcr7(Δ3-5/T93M) mouse model of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) has been investigated. This is a viable mouse model which is compound heterozygous containing one null allele and one T93M mutation on Dhcr7. We find the SLOS mouse has reduced levels of cholesterol and desmosterol and increased levels of 7- and 8-dehydrocholesterol and of 7- and 8-dehydrodesmosterol in brain compared to the wild type. The profile of enzymatically formed oxysterols in the SLOS mouse resembles that in the wild type but the level of 24S-hydroxycholesterol, the dominating cholesterol metabolite, is reduced in a similar proportion to that of cholesterol. A number of oxysterols abundant in the SLOS mouse are probably derived from 7-dehydrocholesterol, however, the mechanism of their formation is unclear.
12498985	Vitamin C inhibits diethylmaleate-induced L-cystine transport in human vascular smooth muscle cells.	Adaptive increases in intracellular glutathione (GSH) in response to oxidative stress are mediated by induction of L-cystine uptake via the anionic amino acid transport system x(c)(-). The recently cloned transporter xCT forms a heteromultimeric complex with the heavy chain of 4F2 cell surface antigen (4F2hc/CD98). Depletion of GSH by the electrophile diethylmaleate (DEM) induces the activity and expression of xCT in peritoneal macrophages. We here examine the effects of vitamin C on induction of xCT by DEM in human umbilical artery smooth muscle cells. DEM caused time- (3-24 h) and concentration- (25-100 microM) dependent increases in L-cystine transport, with GSH depleted by 50% after 6 h and restored to basal values after 24 h. xCT mRNA levels increased after 4 h DEM treatment with negligible changes detected for 4F2hc mRNA. DEM caused a rapid (5-30 min) phosphorylation of p38(MAPK). Inhibition of p38(MAPK) by SB203580 (10 microM) enhanced DEM-induced increases in L-cystine transport and GSH, whereas inhibition of p42/p44(MAPK) (PD98059, 10 microM) had no effect. Pretreatment of cells with vitamin C (100 microM, 24 h) attenuated DEM-induced adaptive increases in L-cystine transport and GSH levels. Inhibition of p38(MAPK), but not p42/p44(MAPK), reduced the cytoprotective action of vitamin C. Our findings suggest that DEM induces activation of xCT via intracellular signaling pathways involving p38(MAPK), and that vitamin C, in addition to its antioxidant properties, may modulate this signaling pathway to protect smooth muscle cells from injury.
22669363	Enzyme replacement therapy for mucopolysaccharidosis VI: long-term cardiac effects of galsulfase (Naglazyme®) therapy.	Characteristic cardiac valve abnormalities and left ventricular hypertrophy are present in untreated patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (MPS VI). Cardiac ultrasound was performed to investigate these findings in subjects during long-term enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human arylsulfatase B (rhASB, rhN-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase, galsulfase, Naglazyme®). Studies were conducted in 54 subjects before ERT was begun and at specific intervals for up to 96 weeks of weekly infusions of rhASB at 1 mg/kg during phase 1/2, phase 2, and phase 3 trials of rhASB. At baseline, mitral and aortic valve obstruction was present and was significantly greater in those ≥12 years of age. Mild mitral and trace aortic regurgitation were present, the former being significantly greater in those <12 years. Left ventricular hypertrophy, with averaged z-scores ranging from 1.6-1.9 SD greater than normal, was present for ages both <12 and ≥12 years. After 96 weeks of ERT, ventricular septal hypertrophy regressed in those <12 years. For those ≥12 years, septal hypertrophy was unchanged, and aortic regurgitation increased statistically but not physiologically. Obstructive gradients across mitral and aortic valves remained unchanged. The results suggest that long-term ERT is effective in reducing intraventricular septal hypertrophy and preventing progression of cardiac valve abnormalities when administered to those <12 years of age.
14718599	Transport of pharmacologically active proline derivatives by the human proton-coupled amino acid transporter hPAT1.	Several proline derivatives such as L-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid, cis-4-hydroxy-L-proline, and 3,4-dehydro-DL-proline prevent procollagen from folding into a stable triple-helical conformation, thereby reducing excessive deposition of collagen in fibrotic processes and the growth of tumors. This study was performed to investigate whether the recently discovered human proton-coupled amino acid transporter 1 (hPAT1) is capable of transporting such pharmacologically relevant proline derivatives and also GABA analogs. Uptake of L-[3H]proline and [3H]glycine in Caco-2 cells was Na+-independent but strongly H+-dependent. The L-proline uptake was saturable and mediated by a single transport system (hPAT1) with an affinity constant of 2.0 +/- 0.2 mM. The uptake of L-[3H]proline was inhibited by D-proline, trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline, cis-4-hydroxy-L-proline, cis-4-hydroxy-D-proline, 3,4-dehydro-DL-proline, L-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid, 3-amino-1-propanesulfonic acid, D- and L-pipecolic acid, l-thiaproline, and many others. Apical uptake and transepithelial flux of L-[3H]proline across Caco-2 cell monolayers were strongly inhibited by proline derivatives in proportions corresponding to their respective affinity constants at hPAT1. The basolateral to apical flux of L-[3H]proline was only 8% of that in the opposite direction. Apical uptake of unlabeled L-proline, cis-4-hydroxy-L-proline, and L-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid was stimulated by an inside directed H+ gradient 2- to 3-fold. Total apical to basolateral flux of proline derivatives was moderately correlated with their inhibitory potency for L-[3H]proline uptake and flux inhibition. We conclude that 1) the substrate specificity of hPAT1 is very much broader than so far reported and 2) the system accepts therapeutically relevant proline and GABA derivatives. hPAT1 is a promising candidate for new ways of oral drug delivery.
23500411	"Synthesis of C17-OH-north unit of ritterazine G via ""Red-Ox"" modifications of hecogenin acetate."	The C17-OH-north unit of ritterazine G was prepared in 13 steps from hecogenin acetate. This synthesis features a highly efficient and stereoselective introduction of the C17-OH via E-ring cleavage/F-ring formation, D-ring oxidation, and F-ring cleavage/E-ring formation.
22537580	Two new C-15 enolic acyl phragmalin-type limonoids from Chukrasia tabularis var. velutina.	Two new C-15 enolic acyl phragmalin-type limonoid orthoesters, chukvelutilide G (1) and chukrasine F (2), were isolated from the stem barks of Chukrasia tabularis var. velutina. Their structures were elucidated by their extensive high resolution-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HR-ESI-MS), one- and two-dimensional spectroscopic analysis, including heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC), HMBC and NOESY experiments.
23093496	Identification of determinants required for agonistic and inverse agonistic ligand properties at the ADP receptor P2Y12.	The ADP receptor P2Y(12) belongs to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and its activation triggers platelet aggregation. Therefore, potent antagonists, such as clopidogrel, are of high clinical relevance in prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic events. P2Y(12) displays an elevated basal activity in vitro, and as such, inverse agonists may be therapeutically beneficial compared with antagonists. Only a few inverse agonists of P2Y(12) have been described. To expand this limited chemical space and improve understanding of structural determinants of inverse agonist-receptor interaction, this study screened a purine compound library for lead structures using wild-type (WT) human P2Y(12) and 28 constitutively active mutants. Results showed that ATP and ATP derivatives are agonists at P2Y(12). The potency at P2Y(12) was 2-(methylthio)-ADP > 2-(methylthio)-ATP > ADP > ATP. Determinants required for agonistic ligand activity were identified. Molecular docking studies revealed a binding pocket for the ATP derivatives that is bordered by transmembrane helices 3, 5, 6, and 7 in human P2Y(12,) with Y(105), E(188), R(256), Y(259), and K(280) playing a particularly important role in ligand interaction. N-Methyl-anthraniloyl modification at the 3'-OH of the 2'-deoxyribose leads to ligands (mant-deoxy-ATP [dATP], mant-deoxy-ADP) with inverse agonist activity. Inverse agonist activity of mant-dATP was found at the WT human P2Y(12) and half of the constitutive active P2Y(12) mutants. This study showed that, in addition to ADP and ATP, other ATP derivatives are not only ligands of P2Y(12) but also agonists. Modification of the ribose within ATP can result in inverse activity of ATP-derived ligands.
10980326	Serotonin transporter gene regulatory region polymorphism (5-HTTLPR), [3H]paroxetine binding in healthy control subjects and alcohol-dependent patients and their relationships to impulsivity.	The aim of this study was to investigate [3H]paroxetine binding and impulsivity in alcohol-dependent and age-matched control subjects in relation to a 5'-promoter region serotonin transporter (5-HTT) polymorphism (5-HTTLPR). Alcohol-dependent subjects were hypothesized to show a decreased number of bindings sites and a lower dissociation constant. 5-HTTLPR S-genotype carriers in both alcohol-dependent and control subjects were expected to show significantly fewer binding sites and a lower dissociation constant. Influences of impulsive traits, chronic daily alcohol intake, duration of alcohol dependence, age of onset and age on [3H]paroxetine binding were also investigated. Inpatients meeting DSM IV alcohol dependence criteria and of German descent were recruited to avoid ethnic stratification effects. One hundred and seventeen control subjects of similar social status were recruited from a town community. Blood samples were taken from both alcohol-dependent and control subjects to determine 5-HTTLPR genotypes using PCR of lymphocyte DNA, and to perform platelet [3H]paroxetine binding (binding capacity: B(max); and dissociation constant: K(D)). Impulsivity was assessed using the Barratt impulsiveness scale version 5 (BIS-5) in alcohol-dependent subjects only. Alcohol-dependent subjects were subdivided into low or high impulsivity groups using a median-split of the BIS-5 scale. The control group was slightly older than the alcohol-dependent group (not statistically significant). [3H]paroxetine binding was investigated in 72 control subjects and 72 patients, of which five patients met type 2 alcohol dependence criteria. Genotyping was carried out in all patients and control subjects. A significant influence of duration of alcohol dependence was found on the [3H]paroxetine binding K(D) but not B(max.) Neither alcohol-dependent nor control subjects showed any differences in B(max) or K(D). S-allele carriers did not show a decreased binding or lower dissociation constant. Furthermore, no significant interaction between B(max) and K(D) with either 5-HTTLPR genotype or impulsivity was revealed. This was the first study to investigate platelet [3H]paroxetine binding in alcohol-dependent and age-matched control subjects in relation to the 5-HTTLPR genotype. No differences concerning 5-HTTLPR-alleles were found in these groups Furthermore, no significant interaction between these parameters and impulsivity was shown in alcohol-dependent subjects. These results do not support previous results of altered [3H]paroxetine binding sites in alcohol-dependent subjects or 5-HTTLPR S-allele carriers. K(D) might be influenced by duration of alcohol dependence, but not sufficiently to yield differences between alcohol-dependent and control subjects.
18237195	Melatonin is a potent inhibitor for myeloperoxidase.	Myeloperoxidase (MPO) catalyzes the formation of potent oxidants that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases including atherosclerosis, asthma, arthritis, and cancer. Melatonin plays an important part in the regulation of various body functions including circadian sleep rhythms, blood pressure, oncogenesis, retinal function, seasonal reproduction, and immunity. Here, we demonstrate that melatonin serves as a potent inhibitor of MPO under physiological-like conditions. In the presence of chloride (Cl-), melatonin inactivated MPO at two points in the classic peroxidase cycle through binding to MPO to form an inactive complex, melatonin-MPO-Cl, and accelerating MPO compound II formation, an inactive form of MPO. Inactivation of MPO was mirrored by the direct conversion of MPO-Fe(III) to MPO compound II without any sign of compound I accumulation. This behavior indicates that melatonin binding modulates the formation of MPO intermediates and their decay rates. The Cl- presence enhanced the affinity of MPO toward melatonin, which switches the enzyme activity from peroxidation to catalase-like activity. In the absence of Cl-, melatonin served as a 1e- substrate for MPO compound I, but at higher concentration it limited the reaction by its dissociation from the corresponding complex. Importantly, melatonin-dependent inhibition of MPO occurred with a wide range of concentrations that span various physiological and supplemental ranges. Thus, the interplay between MPO and melatonin may have a broader implication in the function of several biological systems. This dual regulation by melatonin is unique and represents a new means through which melatonin can control MPO and its downstream inflammatory pathways.
23030766	Effective phagocytosis of low Her2 tumor cell lines with engineered, aglycosylated IgG displaying high FcγRIIa affinity and selectivity.	Glycans anchored to residue N297 of the antibody IgG Fc domain are critical in mediating binding toward FcγRs to direct both adaptive and innate immune responses. However, using a full length bacterial IgG display system, we have isolated aglycosylated Fc domains with mutations that confer up to a 160-fold increase in the affinity toward the low affinity FcγRIIa-R131 allele as well as high selectivity against binding to the remarkably homologous human inhibitory receptor, FcγRIIb. The mutant Fc domain (AglycoT-Fc1004) contained a total of 5 amino acid substitutions that conferred an activating to inhibitory ratio of 25 (A/I ratio; FcyRIIa-R131:FcγRIIb). Incorporation of this engineered Fc into trastuzumab, an anti-Her2 antibody, resulted in a 75% increase in tumor cell phagocytosis by macrophages compared to that of the parental glycosylated trastuzumab with both medium and low Her2-expressing cancer cells. A mathematical model has been developed to help explain how receptor affinity and the A/I ratio relate to improved antibody dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis. Our model provides guidelines for the future engineering of Fc domains with enhanced effector function.
8001268	Cardiac electrophysiological actions of the histamine H1-receptor antagonists astemizole and terfenadine compared with chlorpheniramine and pyrilamine.	We compared the cardiac electrophysiological actions of two types of H1-receptor antagonists--the piperidines, astemizole and terfenadine, and the nonpiperidines, chlorpheniramine and pyrilamine-in vitro in guinea pig ventricular myocytes and in vivo in chloralose-anesthetized dogs. Astemizole and terfenadine significantly increased action potential duration of guinea pig myocytes. This concentration-dependent prolongation of action potential duration was reverse frequency dependent and led to development of early afterdepolarizations, which occurred more frequently at higher concentrations and slower pacing frequencies. Astemizole and terfenadine potently blocked the rapidly activating component of the delayed rectifier, IKr, with IC50 values of 1.5 and 50 nmol/L, respectively. At 10 mumol/L, terfenadine but not astemizole blocked the slowly activating component of the delayed rectifier, IKs (58.4 +/- 3.1%), and the inward rectifier, IK1 (20.5 +/- 3.4%). Chlorpheniramine and pyrilamine blocked IKr relatively weakly (IC50 = 1.6 and 1.1 mumol/L, respectively) and IKs and IK1 less than 20% at 10 mumol/L. Astemizole and terfenadine (1.0 to 3.0 mg/kg IV) significantly prolonged the QTc interval and ventricular effective refractory period in vivo. Chlorpheniramine and pyrilamine (< or = 3.0 mg/kg) did not significantly affect these parameters. Block of repolarizing K+ currents, particularly IK1, by astemizole and terfenadine produces reverse rate-dependent prolongation of action potential duration and development of early afterdepolarizations, delays ventricular repolarization, and may underlie the development of torsade de pointes ventricular arrhythmias observed with the use and abuse of these agents.
23448346	Synthesis of novel estrogen receptor antagonists using metal-catalyzed coupling reactions and characterization of their biological activity.	Estrogen receptor (ER) antagonists are valuable in the treatment of ER-positive human breast cancer. In this study, we designed and synthesized nine new derivatives of 17β-estradiol (E2) with a bulky side chain attached to its C-7α position, and determined their ER antagonistic activity using in vitro bioassays. Four of the derivatives showed a strong inhibition of ERα transactivation activity in a luciferase reporter assay and blocked ERα interactions with coactivators. Similarly, these derivatives also strongly inhibited the growth of the ERα-positive human breast cancer cells. Computational docking analysis was conducted to model the interaction of these antagonists with the human ERα and showed that they could tightly bind to the ERα in a manner similar to that of ICI-182,780, a pure ER antagonist. These results provide an example that attachment of a bulky side chain to the C-7α position of E2 can produce ER antagonists with ER affinity comparable to that of ICI-182,780.
23560442	Enhancing Raman Scattering without Plasmons: Unprecedented Sensitivity Achieved by TiO2 Shell-Based Resonators.	A remarkable enhancement of Raman scattering is achieved by TiO2 shell-based spherical resonators in the absence of plasmonic enhancers. This effect is ascribed to the synergistic combination of high refractive index of the shell layer, multiple light scattering through the spheres, and related geometrical factors and can be exploited to fabricate a new generation of self-diagnostic, recyclable SERS-active substrates.
17097861	Characterization of the molecular mechanisms involved in the increased insulin secretion in rats with acute liver failure.	To investigate the mechanism of hyperinsulinaemia in rats with acute liver failure induced by the administration of d-galactosamine (GalN), we focused on the role of polyprimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) in islet insulin synthesis. Recent reports indicate that PTB binds and stabilizes mRNA encoding insulin and insulin secretory granule proteins, including islet cell autoantigen 512 (ICA512), prohormone convertase 1/3 (PC1/3), and PC2. In the present study, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was significantly increased in GalN-treated rats compared to controls. Levels of mRNA encoding insulin 1, ICA512, and PC1/3 were increased in the pancreatic islets of GalN-treated rats. This mRNA level elevation was not prevented by pretreatment with actinomycin D. When the PTB-binding site in insulin 1 mRNA was incubated with the islet cytosolic fraction, the RNA-protein complex level was increased in the cytosolic fraction obtained from GalN-treated rats compared to the level in control rats. The cytosolic fraction obtained from pancreatic islets obtained from GalN-treated rats had an increased PTB level compared to the levels obtained from the pancreatic islets of control rats. These findings suggest that, in rats with acute liver failure, cytosolic PTB binds and stabilizes mRNA encoding insulin and its secretory granule proteins.
23457122	Prenatal bisphenol a exposure alters sex-specific estrogen receptor expression in the neonatal rat hypothalamus and amygdala.	Bisphenol A (BPA) exposure is ubiquitous, and in laboratory animals, early-life BPA exposure has been shown to alter sex-specific neural organization, neuroendocrine physiology, and behavior. The specific mechanisms underlying these brain-related outcomes, however, remain largely unknown, constraining the capacity to ascertain the potential human relevance of neural effects observed in animal models. In the perinatal rat brain, estrogen is masculinizing, suggesting that BPA-induced perturbation of estrogen receptor (ESR) expression may underpin later in-life neuroendocrine effects. We hypothesized that prenatal BPA exposure alters sex-specific ESR1 (ERα) and ESR2 (ERβ) expression in postnatal limbic nuclei. Sprague Dawley rats were mated and gavaged on gestational days (GDs) 6-21 with vehicle, 2.5 or 25 μg/kg bw/day BPA, or 5 or 10 μg/kg bw/day ethinyl estradiol. An additional group was restrained but not gavaged (naïve control). Offspring were sacrificed the day after birth to quantify ESR gene expression throughout the hypothalamus and amygdala by in situ hybridization. Relative to the vehicle group, significant effects of BPA were observed on ESR1 and ESR2 expression throughout the mediobasal hypothalamus and amygdala in both sexes. Significant differences in ESR expression were also observed in the mediobasal hypothalamus and amygdala of the naïve control group compared with the vehicle group, highlighting the potential for gavage to influence gene expression in the developing brain. These results indicate that ESR expression in the neonatal brain of both sexes can be altered by low-dose prenatal BPA exposure.
23384446	The effect of inorganic arsenic on endothelium-dependent relaxation: Role of NADPH oxidase and hydrogen peroxide.	Chronic arsenic ingestion predisposes to vascular disease, but underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In the present study we have analyzed the effects of short-term arsenite exposure on vascular function and endothelium-dependent relaxation. Endothelium-dependent relaxations, nitric oxide (NO) and endothelium derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF)-type, were studied in rabbit iliac artery and aortic rings using the G protein-coupled receptor agonist acetylcholine (ACh) and by cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), which promotes store-operated Ca(2+) entry by inhibiting the endothelial SERCA pump. Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the endothelium of rabbit aortic valve leaflets and endothelium-denuded RIA and aortic rings was assessed by imaging of dihydroethidium. In the iliac artery, exposure to 100μM arsenite for 30min potentiated EDHF-type relaxations evoked by both CPA and ACh. Potentiation was prevented by catalase, the catalase/superoxide dismutase mimetic manganese porphyrin and the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin. By contrast in aortic rings, that exhibited negligible EDHF-type responses, endothelium-dependent NO-mediated relaxations evoked by CPA and ACh were unaffected by arsenite. Arsenite induced apocynin-sensitive increases in ROS production in the aortic valve endothelium, but not in the media and adventitia of the iliac artery and aorta. Our results suggest that arsenite can potentiate EDHF-type relaxations via a mechanism that is dependent on hydrogen peroxide, thus demonstrating that dismutation of the superoxide anion generated by NADPH oxidase can potentially offset loss of NO bioavailability under conditions of reduced eNOS activity. By contrast, selective increases in endothelial ROS production following exposure to arsenite failed to modify relaxations mediated by endogenous NO.
23123646	Neuroprotective role of ATP-sensitive potassium channels in cerebral ischemia.	ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels are weak, inward rectifiers that couple metabolic status to cell membrane electrical activity, thus modulating many cellular functions. An increase in the ADP/ATP ratio opens K(ATP) channels, leading to membrane hyperpolarization. K(ATP) channels are ubiquitously expressed in neurons located in different regions of the brain, including the hippocampus and cortex. Brief hypoxia triggers membrane hyperpolarization in these central neurons. In vivo animal studies confirmed that knocking out the Kir6.2 subunit of the K(ATP) channels increases ischemic infarction, and overexpression of the Kir6.2 subunit reduces neuronal injury from ischemic insults. These findings provide the basis for a practical strategy whereby activation of endogenous K(ATP) channels reduces cellular damage resulting from cerebral ischemic stroke. K(ATP) channel modulators may prove to be clinically useful as part of a combination therapy for stroke management in the future.
23473805	Lipid raft modulation by Rp1 reverses multidrug resistance via inactivating MDR-1 and Src inhibition.	Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major obstacle to effective cancer therapy. The membrane transporter MDR-1 (P-gp, ABCB1), a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, effluxes anti-cancer drugs from cancer cells. Increased activity of MDR-1 is known to be the main mechanism for multidrug resistance. MDR-1 is known to be localized in the cholesterol- and sphingolipid-enriched plasma membrane microdomains, known as lipid rafts. Disruption of lipid rafts by cholesterol depletion alters lipid raft functions, indicating that cholesterol is critical for raft function. Because ginsenosides are structurally similar to cholesterol, in this study, we investigated the effect of Rp1, a novel ginsenoside derivative, on drug resistance using drug-sensitive OVCAR-8 and drug-resistant NCI/ADR-RES and DXR cells. Rp1 treatment resulted in an accumulation of doxorubicin or rhodamine 123 by decreasing MDR-1 activity in doxorubicin-resistant cells. Rp1 synergistically induced cell death with actinomycin D in DXR cells. Rp1 appeared to redistribute lipid rafts and MDR-1 protein. Moreover, Rp1 reversed resistance to actinomycin D by decreasing MDR-1 protein levels and Src phosphorylation with modulation of lipid rafts. Addition of cholesterol attenuated Rp1-induced raft aggregation and MDR-1 redistribution. Rp1 and actinomycin D reduced Src activity, and overexpression of active Src decreased the synergistic effect of Rp1 with actinomycin D. Rp1-induced drug sensitization was also observed with several anti-cancer drugs, including doxorubicin. These data suggest that lipid raft-modulating agents can be used to inhibit MDR-1 activity and thus overcome drug resistance.
14587496	Update on rivastigmine.	BACKGROUND: Rivastigmine is a carbamate drug designed to inhibit both acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase by reversibly covalently bonding to these enzymes. Butyrylcholinesterase in-creases as Alzheimer disease progresses, so its inhibition may become more important as the disease worsens. Metabolism of rivastigmine occurs at the synapse rather than at the liver and previous studies have demonstrated no drug-drug interactions. Rivastigmine has a half-life at the synapse of 9 hours allowing for bid dosing. REVIEW SUMMARY: Effective therapy requires up-titration from initial dosage of 3 mg/d to 6 mg/d with additional increases to 9 mg or 12 mg/d giving additional benefits in some patients. Beneficial effects with rivastigmine therapy in the functioning of activities of daily living, behavior, cognition, and global functioning have been demonstrated in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease in 4 large double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trials. Potential adverse effects of nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea in these original Alzheimer trials with rapid (every week) dosage increases occurred in up to 34% of patients and can be minimized by slower monthly up-titrations. Rivastigmine also was proven effective in decreasing psychiatric symptoms and cognitive deficits in a large double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with diffuse Lewy body disease. Other studies have suggested that rivastigmine improves symptoms in nursing home patients with more severe stage Alzheimer disease, Parkinson dementia, and subcortical dementia. Follow-up studies have suggested that rivastigmine may delay disease progression and, in patients discontinuing the drug, no withdrawal effects were seen. CONCLUSION: Rivastigmine is an effective therapeutic agent for treating cognitive and behavioral symptoms in Alzheimer disease and diffuse Lewy body disease and may also have beneficial effects in vascular and Parkinson dementias.
11906441	Chemoprevention for high-risk women: tamoxifen and beyond.	The demonstration by the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast Project (NSABP) that 5 years of tamoxifen therapy is associated with an approximate 50% reduction in breast cancer incidence in high-risk women was a milestone in breast cancer prevention. Because tamoxifen is associated with increased risk of side-effects such as hot flashes, menstrual abnormalities, uterine cancer, and thromboembolic phenomena, its use will not be advisable or acceptable for all high-risk women. Women over 50 years of age appear to be at highest risk for serious adverse events, such as uterine cancer and thromboembolic phenomena. Individuals in whom tamoxifen-associated breast cancer risk reduction appears to outweigh risk of serious side-effects include women with prior in situ or estrogen receptor (ER)-positive invasive cancer, atypical hyperplasia, and/or women ages 35-49 with a calculated Gail 5-year risk of > or =1.7%, hysterectomized women aged 50 and older with a 5-year Gail risk of > or =2.5%, and nonhysterectomized women aged 50 and older with a 5-year Gail risk of >5.0%. It is not yet clear whether tamoxifen can reduce breast cancer incidence in women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, although preliminary evidence favors benefit for at least those with a BRCA2 mutation. Raloxifene is a selective ER modulator with less uterine estrogen agonist activity than tamoxifen, and it is hoped that it will result in fewer uterine cancers but will be equally efficacious in reducing the risk of breast cancer. The NSABP is currently conducting a randomized study of tamoxifen versus raloxifene in high-risk postmenopausal women. Approximately one third of invasive cancers are ER negative. Tamoxifen does not reduce the incidence of ER-negative cancers, nor does it appear to be effective in preventing the appearance of one third of ER-positive cancers. Priorities in prevention research are to develop (a) biomarkers to refine short-term risk assessments based on epidemiologic models, (b) biomarkers predictive of response to specific classes of preventive agents, (c) drugs with fewer side-effects and/or effective in ER-negative or ER-positive tamoxifen-resistant precancerous disease, and (d) efficient clinical trial models to assess new agent efficacy. Breast intraepithelial neoplasia (IEN) may be sampled by minimally invasive techniques and is an attractive short-term risk biomarker. Molecular abnormalities observed in IEN may be used to select potential agents for testing/therapy, and modulation of these abnormalities may be used in phase I trials to select appropriate doses and in phase II trials to assess response. Breast density volume and certain serum markers such as insulin-like growth factor-1 are also being studied as potential risk and response biomarkers. Reversal or prevention of advanced IEN as well as modulation of other risk biomarkers in randomized phase II and phase III trials is being evaluated as a means of more efficiently evaluating prevention drugs in the future. A number of agents are being developed that target molecular abnormalities in IEN, have fewer or different side effects than tamoxifen, and may be effective in ER-negative or tamoxifen-resistant disease.
9843368	Crystallographic analysis of the human phenylalanine hydroxylase catalytic domain with bound catechol inhibitors at 2.0 A resolution.	The aromatic amino acid hydroxylases represent a superfamily of structurally and functionally closely related enzymes, one of those functions being reversible inhibition by catechol derivatives. Here we present the crystal structure of the dimeric catalytic domain (residues 117-424) of human phenylalanine hydroxylase (hPheOH), cocrystallized with various potent and well-known catechol inhibitors and refined at a resolution of 2.0 A. The catechols bind by bidentate coordination to each iron in both subunits of the dimer through the catechol hydroxyl groups, forming a blue-green colored ligand-to-metal charge-transfer complex. In addition, Glu330 and Tyr325 are identified as determinant residues in the recognition of the inhibitors. In particular, the interaction with Glu330 conforms to the structural explanation for the pH dependence of catecholamine binding to PheOH, with a pKa value of 5.1 (20 degreesC). The overall structure of the catechol-bound enzyme is very similar to that of the uncomplexed enzyme (rms difference of 0.2 A for the Calpha atoms). Most striking is the replacement of two iron-bound water molecules with catechol hydroxyl groups. This change is consistent with a change in the ligand field symmetry of the high-spin (S = 5/2) Fe(III) from a rhombic to a nearly axial ligand field symmetry as seen upon noradrenaline binding using EPR spectroscopy [Martinez, A., Andersson, K. K., Haavik, J., and Flatmark, T. (1991) Eur. J. Biochem. 198, 675-682]. Crystallographic comparison with the structurally related rat tyrosine hydroxylase binary complex with the oxidized cofactor 7,8-dihydrobiopterin revealed overlapping binding sites for the catechols and the cofactor, compatible with a competitive type of inhibition of the catechols versus BH4. The comparison demonstrates some structural differences at the active site as the potential basis for the different substrate specificity of the two enzymes.
23578341	Asymmetric dimethylarginine predicts decline of glucose tolerance in men with stable coronary artery disease: a 4.5-year follow-up study.	BACKGROUND: Endothelial dysfunction, largely dependent on impaired nitric oxide bioavailability, has been reportedly associated with incident type 2 diabetes. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide formation, might be linked to future deterioration in glucose tolerance in stable coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS: We studied 80 non-diabetic men (mean age 55 +/- 11 years) with stable angina who underwent successful elective complex coronary angioplasty and were receiving a standard medical according to practice guidelines. Plasma ADMA and its structural isomer symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) were measured prior to coronary angiography. An estimate of insulin resistance by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR index) was calculated from fasting insulin and glucose. Deterioration in glucose tolerance was defined as development of type 2 diabetes or progression from a normal glucose tolerance to impaired fasting glucose. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 55 months 11 subjects developed type 2 diabetes and 13 progressed to impaired fasting glucose. Incident deterioration of glucose tolerance was associated with ADMA (hazard ratio [HR] per 1-SD increment 1.64 [95% CI: 1.14--2.35]; P = 0.007), log (HOMA-IR index) (HR = 1.60 [1.16--2.20]; P = 0.004) and body-mass index (HR = 1.44 [0.95--2.17]; P = 0.08) by univariate Cox regression. ADMA (HR = 1.65 [1.14--2.38]; p = 0.008) and log (HOMA-IR index) (HR = 1.55 [1.10--2.17]; P = 0.01) were multivariate predictors of a decline in glucose tolerance. ADMA and SDMA were unrelated to body-mass index, HOMA-IR index, insulin or glucose. CONCLUSIONS: ADMA predicts future deterioration of glucose tolerance independently of baseline insulin resistance in men with stable CAD. Whether this association reflects a contribution of endothelial dysfunction to accelerated decline of insulin sensitivity, or represents only an epiphenomenon accompanying pre-diabetes, remains to be elucidated. The observed relationship might contribute to the well-recognized ability of ADMA to predict cardiovascular outcome.
10207608	Phospholipase A2 inhibitors p-bromophenacyl bromide and arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone suppressed interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression in murine primary splenocytes.	Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) has been postulated to play a role in the regulation of cytokine expression. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of PLA2 inhibitors p-bromophenacyl bromide (BPB) and arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF3) on interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression in murine primary splenocytes. Pretreatment of the splenocytes with both BPB and AACOCF3 suppressed phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate plus ionomycin-induced IL-2 secretion in a concentration-dependent manner. Inhibition > 90% of IL-2 secretion was observed at 1 microM BPB and 10 microM AACOCF3 compared to the respective vehicle control. Likewise, IL-2 steady-state mRNA expression was inhibited by both PLA2 inhibitors in a concentration-dependent fashion with > 90% inhibition at 1 microM BPB and 20 microM AACOCF3. Taken together, these data demonstrated that PLA2 inhibitors BPB and AACOCF3 are robust inhibitors of IL-2 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels in murine splenocytes. Moreover, these findings suggest that drugs and chemicals which inhibit PLA2 may have marked effects on T-cell function.
14680444	Efficacy and safety of tamsulosin in the treatment of urological diseases.	The alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, tamsulosin, is selective for alpha(1A)- and alpha(1D)- over alpha(1B)-adrenoceptors. Both placebo-controlled and comparative studies with other agents have demonstrated tamsulosin to be an effective treatment for patients with lower urinary symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Its effectiveness appears to be maintained over many years. Tamsulosin may also effectively reduce lower urinary tract symptoms in other urological diseases. A dose of tamsulosin 0.4 mg/day has a tolerability close to that of placebo and has little, if any, blood pressure lowering effects. Tolerability and lack of blood pressure lowering are maintained even in high-risk patients such as those with cardiovascular comorbidity and/or comedication. Apart from adrenoceptor subtype-selectivity, a smooth pharmacokinetic profile of its modified-release formulation and a selective accumulation in target tissues may contribute to an excellent efficacy:tolerability ratio.
23194532	The in vivo antioxidant and antifibrotic properties of green tea (Camellia sinensis, Theaceae).	The in vivo antioxidant and antifibrotic properties of green tea (Camellia sinensis, Theaceae) were investigated with a study of carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4))-induced oxidative stress and hepatic fibrosis in male ICR mice. Oral administration of green tea extract at doses of 125, 625 and 1250 mg/kg for 8 weeks significantly reduced (p<0.05) the levels of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) and protein carbonyls in the liver by at least 28% compared with that was induced by CCl(4) (1 mL/kg) in mice. Moreover, green tea extract administration significantly increased (p<0.05) the activities of catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and glutathione reductase (GSH-Rd) in the liver. Our study found that oral administration of green tea extract prevented CCl(4)-induced hepatic fibrosis, as evidenced by a decreased hydroxyproline level in the liver and a reduced incidence of hepatic fibrosis by histological observations. These results indicate that green tea exhibits potent protective effects against CCl(4)-induced oxidative stress and hepatic fibrosis in mice by inhibiting oxidative damage and increasing antioxidant enzyme activities.
8788445	(-)-Pentazocine analgesia in mice: interactions with a sigma receptor system.	(-)-Pentazocine is active in the tailflick assay in CD-1 mice, although it shows a biphasic dose-response curve with a peak effect of only 30%. Co-administration of haloperidol shifts the dose-response curve to the left and elevates the maximal response to 70% through a blockade of sigma 1 receptors, but the curve remains biphasic. (+)-Pentazocine is inactive in all antinociceptive assays, either alone or with haloperidol. The analgesic actions of (-)-pentazocine are readily reversed by nor-binaltorphimine, but not by the mu-selective opioid receptor antagonist beta-funaltrexamine, implying a kappa 1-opioid receptor mechanism of action. This conclusion is supported by the ability of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides directed against the KOR-1 clone, which encodes the kappa 1-opioid receptor, to block (-)-pentazocine analgesia.
12652111	Comparison of the effects of cilostazol and milrinone on cAMP-PDE activity, intracellular cAMP and calcium in the heart.	We investigated the basis for the difference in the cardiotonic effects of the PDE3 inhibitors cilostazol and milrinone in the rabbit heart. Cilostazol displayed greater selectivity than milrinone for inhibition of cAMP-PDE activity in microsomal vs cytosolic fractions from rabbit heart. This difference was due to the inhibition of significantly less cytosolic cAMP-PDE activity by cilostazol compared to milrinone. A combination of cilostazol (>15 microM) and the PDE4 selective inhibitor, rolipram (5 microM), inhibited levels of cytosolic cAMP-PDE activity similar to those inhibited by milrinone on its own. This suggested that milrinone inhibited PDE4 in addition to PDE3 activity. In isolated rabbit cardiomyocytes, milrinone (>10 microM) caused greater elevations in intracellular cAMP and calcium than cilostazol. In the presence of rolipram, however, the cAMP and calcium elevating effects of cilostazol and milrinone were similar. Therefore, in rabbit heart, partial inhibition of PDE4 by milrinone contributed to greater increases in cardiomyocyte cAMP and calcium levels than cilostazol. PDE4 activity in failing human heart was lower than in rabbit heart and there was no significant difference in the inhibition of human cytosolic cAMP-PDE by cilostazol and milrinone. Our results suggest that in normal rabbit heart inhibition of PDE4 by milrinone may partly contribute to the greater cardiotonic effect of milrinone when compared to cilostazol. However, the lower level of PDE4 activity in failing human heart suggests that factors other than inhibition of PDE4 by milrinone may contribute to differences in cardiotonic action when compared to cilostazol.
23345579	Mass spectrometry method to identify aging pathways of Sp- and Rp-tabun adducts on human butyrylcholinesterase based on the acid labile P-N bond.	The phosphoramidate nerve agent tabun inhibits butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and acetylcholinesterase by making a covalent bond on the active site serine. The adduct loses an alkyl group in a process called aging. The mechanism of aging of the tabun adduct is controversial. Some studies claim that aging proceeds through deamination, whereas crystal structure studies show aging by O-dealkylation. Our goal was to develop a method that clearly distinguishes between deamination and O-dealkylation. We began by studying the tetraisopropyl pyrophosphoramide adduct of BChE because this adduct has two P-N bonds. Mass spectra showed that the P-N bonds were stable during trypsin digestion at pH 8 but were cleaved during pepsin digestion at pH 2. The P-N bond in tabun was also acid labile, whereas the P-O bond was stable. A scheme to distinguish aging by deamination from aging by O-dealkylation was based on the acid labile P-N bond. BChE was inhibited with Sp- and Rp-tabun thiocholine nerve agent model compounds to make adducts identical to those of tabun with known stereochemistry. After aging and digestion with pepsin at pH 2, peptide FGES198AGAAS from Sp-tabun thiocholine had a mass of 902.2 m/z in negative mode, indicating that it had aged by deamination, whereas peptide FGES198AGAAS from Rp-tabun thiocholine had a mass of 874.2 m/z in negative mode, indicating that it had aged by O-dealkylation. BChE inhibited by authentic, racemic tabun yielded both 902.2 and 874.2 m/z peptides, indicating that both stereoisomers reacted with BChE and aged either by deamination or dealkylation.
19002123	The role of combination medical therapy in benign prostatic hyperplasia.	To review key trials of monotherapy and combination therapy of alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor antagonists (alpha(1)-ARAs), 5alpha-reductase inhibitors (5alphaRIs) and anti-muscarinic agents in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). To assess the safety and efficacy of combination therapies for LUTS associated with BPH, a search of the MEDLINE and Cochrane databases (1976-2008) was conducted for relevant trials and reviews using the terms benign prostatic hyperplasia, lower urinary tract symptoms, alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor antagonists, 5alpha-reductase inhibitors, anti-muscarinics, anticholinergics, combination therapy, alfuzosin, doxazosin, tamsulosin, terazosin, dutasteride, finasteride, tolterodine, flavoxate, propiverine, oxybutynin, erectile dysfunction, sildenafil, vardenafil and tadalafil. Data from the Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) study indicated a role for long-term use of alpha(1)-ARAs and 5alphaRIs in combination. In the MTOPS study, combination therapy with the alpha(1)-ARA doxazosin and the 5alphaRI finasteride was significantly more effective than either component alone in reducing symptoms (P=0.006 vs doxazosin monotherapy; P<0.001 vs finasteride monotherapy) and in lowering the rate of clinical progression (P<0.001 vs either monotherapy). These findings were confirmed by the 2-year preliminary results of the Combination of Avodart and Tamsulosin study. In this study, combination therapy of the alpha(1)-ARA tamsulosin and the 5alphaRI dutasteride resulted in a significantly greater decrease in International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) when compared with either monotherapy. Several recent trials have studied the efficacy of combining alpha(1)-ARAs and anti-muscarinic agents in the treatment of BPH. These studies have found this combination to result in statistically significant benefits in quality of life scores, patient satisfaction, urinary frequency, storage symptoms and IPSS scores. Studies have not shown an increased risk of urinary retention associated with the use of anti-muscarinics in a highly select cohort of men with BPH. The available data suggest that combination therapy can be beneficial in the treatment of BPH and associated LUTS. The greatest efficacy for the alpha(1)-ARA and 5alphaRI combination was shown in patients with larger prostate size and more severe symptoms. The combination of alpha(1)-ARAs and 5alphaRIs appears to prevent disease progression in these patients. The combination of alpha(1)-ARAs with anti-muscarinic agents is useful for relieving symptoms of bladder outlet obstruction and detrusor overactivity. Theoretic concerns regarding the risk of acute urinary retention have been refuted in several recent clinical trials; however, it must be noted that the patients in these trials were a highly select cohort of men. Men with overactive bladder and BPH who are not receiving adequate alleviation of symptoms from the first-line alpha(1)-ARAs may benefit from the addition of an anti-muscarinic agent.
8172912	Differential interaction of glimepiride and glibenclamide with the beta-cell sulfonylurea receptor. I. Binding characteristics.	Glimepiride is a novel sulfonylurea drug for treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with higher blood sugar lowering efficacy in diabetic patients than glibenclamide raising the question whether this characteristics is in line with different binding of glimepiride and glibenclamide to the beta-cell sulfonylurea receptor. Scatchard plot analysis of [3H]sulfonylurea binding to membranes isolated from rat beta-cell tumors and (RINm5F) insulinoma cells and to RINm5F cells demonstrated that glimepiride has a 2.5-3-fold lower affinity than glibenclamide. This corresponded well to the 8-9-fold higher koff and 2.5-3-fold higher kon rates of glimepiride compared to glibenclamide as revealed by the dissociation and association kinetics of [3H]sulfonylurea binding and the Kd values calculated thereof. In agreement, the concentrations required for half-maximal displacement of [3H]sulfonylurea bound to beta-cell membranes were significantly higher for glimepiride compared to glibenclamide. However, the binding affinity of glimepiride measured by both equilibrium binding and kinetic binding studies upon solubilization of beta-cell tumor membranes and RINm5F cell membranes increased up to the value for glibenclamide. This was primarily based on a drastic decrease of the dissociation rate constant of glimepiride whereas the kinetics of glibenclamide binding remained largely unaffected upon solubilization. These data suggest that the Kd value alone is not sufficient for characterization of a sulfonylurea drug, since the kinetic binding parameters may also determine its acute blood sugar lowering efficacy.
23194525	The nutritional supplement Active Hexose Correlated Compound (AHCC) has direct immunomodulatory actions on intestinal epithelial cells and macrophages involving TLR/MyD88 and NF-κB/MAPK activation.	Active Hexose Correlated Compound (AHCC) is an immunostimulatory nutritional supplement. AHCC effects and mechanism of action on intestinal epithelial cells or monocytes are poorly described. AHCC was added to the culture medium of intestinal epithelial cells (IEC18 and HT29 cells) and monocytes (THP-1 cells) and assessed the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by ELISA. Inhibitors of NFκB and MAPKs were used to study signal transduction pathways while TLR4 and MyD88 were silenced in IEC18 cells using shRNA. It was found that AHCC induced GROα and MCP1 secretion in IEC18 and IL-8 in HT29 cells. These effects depended on NFκB activation, and partly on MAPKs activation and on the presence of MyD88 and TLR4. In THP-1 cells AHCC evoked IL-8, IL-1β and TNF-α secretion. The induction of IL-8 depended on JNK and NFκB activation. Therefore, AHCC exerts immunostimulatory effects on intestinal epithelial cells and monocytes involving TLR4/MyD88 and NFκB/MAPK signal transduction pathways.
12531805	SU11248 is a novel FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor with potent activity in vitro and in vivo.	FLT3 (fms-related tyrosine kinase/Flk2/Stk-2) is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) primarily expressed on hematopoietic cells. In blasts from acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients, 2 classes of FLT3 activating mutations have been identified: internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations in the juxtamembrane domain (25%-30% of patients) and point mutations in the kinase domain activation loop (7%-8% of patients). FLT3-ITD mutations are the most common molecular defect identified in AML and have been shown to be an independent prognostic factor for decreased survival. FLT3-ITD is therefore an attractive molecular target for therapy. SU11248 is a recently described selective inhibitor with selectivity for split kinase domain RTKs, including platelet-derived growth factor receptors, vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, and KIT. We show that SU11248 also has potent activity against wild-type FLT3 (FLT3-WT), FLT3-ITD, and FLT3 activation loop (FLT3-Asp835) mutants in phosphorylation assays. SU11248 inhibits FLT3-driven phosphorylation and induces apoptosis in vitro. In addition, SU11248 inhibits FLT3-induced VEGF production. The in vivo efficacy of SU11248 was investigated in 2 FLT3-ITD models: a subcutaneous tumor xenograft model and a bone marrow engraftment model. We show that SU11248 (20 mg/kg/d) dramatically regresses FLT3-ITD tumors in the subcutaneous tumor xenograft model and prolongs survival in the bone marrow engraftment model. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis in subcutaneous tumors showed that a single administration of an efficacious drug dose potently inhibits FLT3-ITD phosphorylation for up to 16 hours following a single dose. These results suggest that further exploration of SU11248 activity in AML patients is warranted.
23612487	Sphingosine-1-phosphate promotes the nuclear translocation of β-catenin and thereby induces osteoprotegerin gene expression in osteoblast-like cell lines.	Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a well-known signaling sphingolipid and bioactive lipid mediator. Recently, it was reported that S1P inhibits osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. On the other hand, S1P effects on osteoblasts and bone formation are little known. In this study, we investigated the effects of S1P on osteoblasts, using two osteoblast-like cell lines, SaOS-2 and MC3T3-E1. S1P activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling, leading to the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β and the nuclear translocation of β-catenin, followed by the increase of the transcriptional activity by β-catenin/T-cell factor complex formation in both SaOS-2 cells and MC3T3-E1 cells. The inhibitors of PI3K and Akt suppressed S1P-induced nuclear localization of β-catenin. We further investigated the effects of PI3K/Akt signaling on the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, since β-catenin takes a central role in this signaling pathway. Both inhibitors for PI3K and Akt suppressed the nuclear localization of β-catenin and T-cell factor transcriptional activity induced by Wnt-3a. S1P increased the amount of osteoprotegerin at both mRNA and protein levels, and increased the activity of alkaline phosphatase, leading to the mineralization. These findings suggest that S1P activates the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway leading to the promotion of nuclear translocation of β-catenin in osteoblast-like cells, resulting in the upregulation of osteoptotegerin and osteoblast differentiation markers including alkaline phosphatase, probably relating to the inhibition of osteoclast formation and the mineralization, respectively.
15148258	Inhibition of cardiac HERG currents by the DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor amsacrine: mode of action.	1 The topoisomerase II inhibitor amsacrine is used in the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia. Although most anticancer drugs are believed not to cause acquired long QT syndrome (LQTS), concerns have been raised by reports of QT interval prolongation, ventricular fibrillation and death associated with amsacrine treatment. Since blockade of cardiac human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) potassium currents is an important cause of acquired LQTS, we investigated the acute effects of amsacrine on cloned HERG channels to determine the electrophysiological basis for its proarrhythmic potential. 2 HERG channels were heterologously expressed in human HEK 293 cells and Xenopus laevis oocytes, and the respective potassium currents were recorded using patch-clamp and two-microelectrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology. 3 Amsacrine blocked HERG currents in HEK 293 cells and Xenopus oocytes in a concentration-dependent manner, with IC50 values of 209.4 nm and 2.0 microm, respectively. 4 HERG channels were primarily blocked in the open and inactivated states, and no additional voltage dependence was observed. Amsacrine caused a negative shift in the voltage dependence of both activation (-7.6 mV) and inactivation (-7.6 mV). HERG current block by amsacrine was not frequency dependent. 5 The S6 domain mutations Y652A and F656A attenuated (Y652A) or abolished (F656A, Y652A/F656A) HERG current blockade, indicating that amsacrine binding requires a common drug receptor within the pore-S6 region. 6 In conclusion, these data demonstrate that the anticancer drug amsacrine is an antagonist of cloned HERG potassium channels, providing a molecular mechanism for the previously reported QTc interval prolongation during clinical administration of amsacrine.
9873034	Antifungal imidazoles block assembly of inducible NO synthase into an active dimer.	Cytokine-inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is a homodimeric enzyme that generates nitric oxide (NO) and L-citrulline from L-arginine (L-Arg) and O2. The N-terminal oxygenase domain (amino acids 1-498; iNOSox) in each subunit binds heme, L-Arg, and tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B), is the site of NO synthesis, and is responsible for the dimeric interaction, which must occur to synthesize NO. In both cells and purified systems, iNOS dimer assembly is promoted by H4B, L-Arg, and L-Arg analogs. We examined the ability of imidazole and N-substituted imidazoles to promote or inhibit dimerization of heme-containing iNOSox monomers, or to affect iNOS dimerization in cells. Imidazole, 1-phenylimidazole, clotrimazole, and miconazole all bound to the iNOSox monomer heme iron. Imidazole and 1-phenylimidazole promoted iNOSox dimerization, whereas clotrimazole (30 microM) and miconazole (15 microM) did not, and instead inhibited dimerization normally promoted by L-Arg and H4B. Clotrimazole also bound to iNOSox dimers in the absence of L-Arg and H4B and caused their dissociation. When added to cells expressing iNOS, clotrimazole (50 microM) had no effect on iNOS protein expression but almost completely inhibited its dimerization and consequent NO synthesis over an 8-h culture period, without affecting calmodulin interaction with iNOS. Thus, imidazoles can promote or inhibit dimerization of iNOS both in vitro and in cells, depending on their structure. Bulky imidazoles like clotrimazole block NO synthesis by inhibiting assembly of the iNOS dimer, revealing a new means to control cellular NO synthesis.
23535394	An overview on the marine neurotoxin, saxitoxin: genetics, molecular targets, methods of detection and ecological functions.	Marine neurotoxins are natural products produced by phytoplankton and select species of invertebrates and fish. These compounds interact with voltage-gated sodium, potassium and calcium channels and modulate the flux of these ions into various cell types. This review provides a summary of marine neurotoxins, including their structures, molecular targets and pharmacologies. Saxitoxin and its derivatives, collectively referred to as paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs), are unique among neurotoxins in that they are found in both marine and freshwater environments by organisms inhabiting two kingdoms of life. Prokaryotic cyanobacteria are responsible for PST production in freshwater systems, while eukaryotic dinoflagellates are the main producers in marine waters. Bioaccumulation by filter-feeding bivalves and fish and subsequent transfer through the food web results in the potentially fatal human illnesses, paralytic shellfish poisoning and saxitoxin pufferfish poisoning. These illnesses are a result of saxitoxin's ability to bind to the voltage-gated sodium channel, blocking the passage of nerve impulses and leading to death via respiratory paralysis. Recent advances in saxitoxin research are discussed, including the molecular biology of toxin synthesis, new protein targets, association with metal-binding motifs and methods of detection. The eco-evolutionary role(s) PSTs may serve for phytoplankton species that produce them are also discussed.
23473801	Hinokitiol inhibits platelet activation ex vivo and thrombus formation in vivo.	Hinokitiol is a tropolone-related bioactive compound that has been used in hair tonics, cosmetics, and food as an antimicrobial agent. Recently, hinokitiol has attracted considerable interest because of its anticancer activities. Platelet activation plays a crucial role in atherothrombotic processes. We examined the effects of hinokitiol treatment on platelet activation using human platelets. In the present study, hinokitiol (1 and 2μM) inhibited the collagen-induced aggregation of human platelets, but did not inhibit the activation of platelets by other agonists, including thrombin, arachidonic acid, and ADP. Hinokitiol inhibited the phosphorylation of phospholipase C (PLC)γ2, protein kinase C (PKC), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and Akt in collagen-activated human platelets, and significantly reduced intracellular calcium mobilization and hydroxyl radical (OH) formation. Hinokitiol also reduced the PKC activation and platelet aggregation stimulated by PDBu. In addition, hinokitiol significantly prolonged thrombogenesis in mice. Hinokitiol did not influence the binding of a fluorescent triflavin probe to the αIIbβ3 integrin on platelet membrane, and neither ODQ nor SQ22536 significantly reversed the hinokitiol-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation. In conclusion, hinokitiol may inhibit platelet activation by inhibiting the PLCγ2-PKC cascade and hydroxyl radical formation, followed by suppressing the activation of MAPKs and Akt. Our study suggests that hinokitiol may represent a potential therapeutic agent for the prevention or treatment of thromboembolic disorders.
22989705	Pioglitazone protects against cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity in rats and potentiates its anticancer activity against human renal adenocarcinoma cell lines.	Cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity is a serious problem that limits its use in cancer treatment. The present study aimed to investigate the renal protective capacity of pioglitazone to reduce the cisplatin- induced nephrotoxicity. The underlying suggested mechanism(s) and whether this nephroprotective effect (if any) interferes with the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin on cancer cells were also investigated. Pioglitazone, Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether, BADGE, IP injected (Peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) antagonist), or their combination were administered to rats one hour before cisplatin injection. Moreover, their effects on the cell viability of human renal adenocarcinoma cell models (ACHN) were studied. The obtained results showed that pioglitazone improved the renal function, structural changes, renal malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) genes expression in cisplatin injected rats. It increased both renal reduced glutathione (GSH) content and PPAR-γ gene expression. In contrast to the data obtained by prior administration of BADGE. Pioglitazone also potentiated the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin on human renal adenocarcinoma cells and this effect was abolished by BADGE co administration. In conclusion, these results suggested that pioglitazone protected against cisplatin- induced nephrotoxicity through its interaction with PPAR-γ receptors and antioxidant effects. Furthermore, pioglitazone did not interfere but rather potentiated the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin on human renal adenocarcinoma cells.
23639538	A dihydrochalcone and several homoisoflavonoids from Polygonatum odoratum are activators of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase.	Adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a major cellular energy sensor and master regulator of metabolic homeostasis; thus, AMPK plays a central role in studies on diabetes and related metabolic diseases. From the rhizomes of Polygonatum odoratum (Mill.) Druce, six homoisoflavonoids (1-6) and one dihydrochalcone (7) were isolated, and the structures of polygonatones A-D (4-7) were elucidated by various spectroscopic analyses. Compounds 1-7 were evaluated for their effect on AMPK activation. The amount of active phosphorylated AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase in rat liver epithelial IAR-20 cells increased when the cells were incubated with the aforementioned compounds. Specifically, (3R)-5,7-dihydroxyl-6-methyl-8-methoxyl-3-(4'-hydroxylbenzyl)-chroman-4-one (1), (3R)-5,7-dihydroxyl-6,8-dimethyl-3-(4'-hydroxylbenzyl)-chroman-4-one (2), (3R)-5,7-dihydroxyl-6-methyl-3-(4'-hydroxylbenzyl)-chroman-4-one (3), and polygonatone D (7) exhibited significant activation effects.
23270704	Apocynin and raisanberine alleviate intermittent hypoxia induced abnormal StAR and 3β-HSD and low testosterone by suppressing endoplasmic reticulum stress and activated p66Shc in rat testes.	We hypothesized that hypoxia induced testicular damage is mediated by an activated NADPH oxidase (NOX), therefore, APO (apocynin) an inhibitor of NOX and raisanberine (RS), a calcium influx inhibitor were tested if they could attenuate hypoxic toxicity to the testis. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to hypoxia (10±0.5% O2) for 17d and intervened with APO and RS in the last 6d. Histological changes and expression of pro-inflammation factors were evaluated in vivo. Biomarkers in isolated Leydig cells incubated with H2O2 were also assayed in vitro. Hypoxic rats displayed lower serum testosterone and higher LH and FSH. Upregulation of p22/p47(phox), NOX2, MMP9, PERK and p66Shc was associated with downregulation of StAR, 3β-HSD and Cx43 in the hypoxia testis, revealed by Western blot and immunohistochemical assay, respectively. APO and RS at least partially normalize hypoxia caused male hypogonadism by suppressing ER stress, and p66Shc in testes.
16418310	Emerging role of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the treatment of advanced renal cell cancer: a review.	Advanced and metastatic renal cell cancer (RCC) is resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Only a very small number of patients survive long term after immunotherapy. However, any effect of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and/or interferon on median overall survival is small, and treatment-associated toxicities may be severe. The disease is therefore an area of high unmet medical need. Activation of the VEGF and EGF/RAS/RAF/MAP kinase pathways is frequent in solid tumours such as RCC. Such activation is implicated in tumour angiogenesis and proliferation. VEGF and EGF receptors and molecules (such as RAF kinase) involved in downstream signalling are therefore potential appropriate targets for drug therapy. Several antibodies and low molecular weight tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have completed phase II clinical trials. Phase II studies of multitargeted agents, which include inhibition of VEGFR tyrosine kinase in their repertoire (sorafenib, sunitinib and AG 013736), show clear second-line activity in metastatic RCC. The same is true of the anti-VEGF antibody, bevacizumab. In a randomised phase III comparison against placebo in pretreated patients, sorafenib doubled median progression free survival (24 versus 12 weeks). Studies now in progress will determine whether benefits seen second-line will also be evident first-line, and whether the activity of novel agents can be increased by combining them with each other, with cytokines, or with chemotherapy.
11811354	Nicotine-induced contraction in the rat coronary artery: possible involvement of the endothelium, reactive oxygen species and COX-1 metabolites.	Nicotine caused a contraction of the rat coronary artery in the presence of Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and arachidonic acid, and did not in the absence of these agents. The present experiments were undertaken to pharmacologically characterize the nicotine-induced contraction in ring preparations of the rat coronary artery. The contraction was abolished by chemical removal of endothelium saponin. Oxygen radical scavengers, superoxide dismutase and catalase, significantly attenuated the contraction. Cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) inhibitors (flurbiprofen, ketoprofen and ketrolack) attenuated the nicotine-induced contraction in a concentration-dependent manner, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors at high concentrations (nimesulide and NS-389) slightly attenuated the contraction. A TXA2 synthetase inhibitor (OKY-046) attenuated the contraction to a small extent only at high concentrations. A TXA2 receptor antagonist (S-1452) attenuated the contraction in a concentration-dependent manner. A nicotinic receptor antagonist (hexamethonium) attenuated the contraction in part and an alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist (prazosin) nearly abolished the contraction. From these results, it was suggested that the contraction induced by nicotine in the rat coronary artery in the presence of L-NAME and arachidonic acid is endothelium dependent, and involves reactive oxygen species and endothelial COX-1 metabolites of arachidonic acid. Part of the contraction is probably due to release of norepinephrine.
11530128	Influence of postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy on platelet serotonin uptake site and serotonin 2A receptor binding.	OBJECTIVE: To examine whether binding of [3H]paroxetine to the platelet serotonin transporter or binding of [3H]lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) to the platelet 5-HT(2A) receptor are influenced by postmenopausal estrogen/progestogen treatment. METHODS: Twenty-three postmenopausal women with climacteric symptoms completed this double-blind, randomized, crossover study. The women received 2 mg of estradiol continuously during four 28-day cycles. In the last 14 days of each cycle, 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate, 1 mg of norethindrone acetate, or placebo was given. Before treatment, as well as once during the last week of each treatment, blood samples were collected for analysis of [3H]LSD and [3H]paroxetine binding. The power of the study setup was 81%. The study had an effect size of 0.36, corresponding to the ability to detect a 15% difference in [3H]paroxetine and [3H]LSD binding between treatments with alpha =.05 and beta =.20, based on a previously reported standard deviation within cells of 20% of the mean binding values. RESULTS: The number of platelet receptors (B(max)), or the affinity of the radioligand to the receptor (K(d)), for [3H]paroxetine binding did not change during estrogen or estrogen-progestogen treatment, nor did B(max) or K(d) for [3H]LSD binding change during the different treatments. However, in a subgroup of depressed patients, the decrease in B(max) for [3H]LSD binding during treatment was significantly more pronounced than in the nondepressed subgroup (P <.05). CONCLUSION: Estrogen treatment with or without the addition of progestogen does not affect binding to the serotonin transporter or to the serotonergic 5-HT(2A) receptor in healthy postmenopausal women.
23602985	Chronic social stress during adolescence: Interplay of paroxetine treatment and ageing.	Exposure to chronic stress during developmental periods is a risk factor for a number of psychiatric disorders. While the direct effects of stress exposure have been studied extensively, little is known about the long-lasting effects and the interaction with ageing. The same holds true for the treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which have been shown to prevent or reverse some stress-induced effects. Here, we studied the direct and long-lasting impact of chronic social stress during adolescence and the impact of chronic treatment with the SSRI paroxetine in adulthood and aged animals. Therefore, male CD1 mice at the age of 28 days were subjected to 7 weeks of chronic social stress. Treatment with paroxetine was performed per os with a dosage of 20 mg/g BW. We were able to reverse most of the effects of chronic social stress in adult mice (4 months old) and to some extend in aged animals (15 months old) with the SSRI treatment. Especially the regulation of the HPA axis seems to be affected in aged mice with a shift to the use of vasopressin. Our results demonstrate that chronic stress exposure and antidepressant treatment at the end of the developmental period can have a significant and long-lasting impact, highly relevant for healthy ageing.
23532897	Impact of the Proline Residue on Ligand Binding of Neurotensin Receptor 2 (NTS2)-Selective Peptide-Peptoid Hybrids.	To investigate the binding mode and structure-activity relationships (SARs) of selective neurotensin receptor 2 (NTS2) ligands, novel peptide-peptoid hybrids that simulate the function of the endogenous ligand were developed. Starting from our recently described NTS2 ligands of type 1, structural variants of type 2 and the metabolically stable analogues 3 a,b were developed. Replacement of the proline unit by a collection of structural surrogates and evaluation of the respective molecular probes for NTS2 affinity and selectivity indicated similar SARs as described for NT(8-13) derivatives bound to the subtype NTS1. Peptide-peptoid hybrids 2 d, 3 a,b showed substantial NTS2 binding affinity (Ki =8.1-16 nM) and 2400-8600-fold selectivity over NTS1. The thiazolidine derivative 3 b showed metabolic stability over 32 h in a serum degradation assay. In an inositol phosphate accumulation assay, the neurotensin mimetics 3 a and 3 b displayed an inhibition of constitutive activity exceeding 1.7-2.0 times the activity of NT(8-13). The fluorinated derivative 3 a could afford attractive opportunities to detect NTS2 by (19) F magnetic resonance imaging.
22943130	Quantitation of UGT1A1 in human liver microsomes using stable isotope-labelled peptides and mass spectrometry based proteomic approaches.	1. UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) are a group of drug-metabolizing enzymes that catalyse the conjugation of endogeonous compounds and xenobiotics to yield hydrophilic glucuronides which subsequently undergo excretion. This report describes an approach for the identification and accurate quantitation of human UGT1A1 in complex biological matrices using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of protein digests. 2. A stable isotope-labelled (SIL) peptide of a unique peptide spanning residues 54-69 in exon 1 of the human UGT1A1 protein with the sequence RIYLSADPALVVIEHG was synthesized. The peptide sequence synthesized was in the reverse order of the human peptide with the stable isotope-labels in the amino acid arginine ((13)C6(15)N4) resulting in an increase in the mass of the SIL peptide of 10 amu, from 1753 to 1763. The SIL peptide was quantitated by injecting increasing concentrations of the peptide into the LC-MS to obtain a standard curve. 3. The labelled peptide along with precursor ion monitoring was used to quantify the levels of UGT1A1 in commercial recombinant preparations (supersomes) and individual human liver microsomal samples and pooled human liver micrsomes obtained from BD Biosciences. 4. Glucuronidation activity studies were performed, which demonstrated a positive correlation between enzyme activity levels and the UGT1A1 content in the liver microsomes obtained from individual human donors.
12135320	Decreased expression of arginase II in the kidneys of Dahl salt-sensitive rats.	Arginase catalyzes the hydrolysis of arginine to urea and ornithine. Urea is not only an important solute for concentrating urine but also inhibits Na-K-2Cl cotransport. To elucidate the roles of arginase in the development of salt-sensitive hypertension, we examined arginase activity and expression in the kidney and other organs of Dahl/Rapp salt-sensitive (SS) and salt-resistant (SR) rats before and after 4 weeks' administration of a 4% NaCl or control diet. At 4 weeks of age, arginase activity in the kidney was lower in SS rats than in SR rats. Kidney arginase activity was lower in SS rats than in SR rats at 8 weeks of age, and salt loading did not alter arginase activity. Arginase II (the dominant isoform in the kidney) mRNA and protein in the kidney of salt-loaded SS rats were also lower than those of salt-loaded SR rats. Arginase activities in the liver and cerebellum did not differ between SS and SR rats. To examine the effect of urea, the product of arginase reaction, on the development of hypertension, SS rats were given a 4% NaCl diet containing 5% kaolin or 5% urea. Six-week urea supplementation attenuated the development of hypertension in SS rats. These findings suggest that decreased arginase expression in the kidney may be at least partially responsible for the salt-sensitive hypertension in SS rats.
17639997	Solamargine upregulation of Fas, downregulation of HER2, and enhancement of cytotoxicity using epirubicin in NSCLC cells.	Nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is not generally a chemosensitive tumor, and the mechanism of resistance to the relevant anticancer drugs has not been fully elucidated. Solamargine (SM), the major steroidal glycoalkaloids extracted from the Chinese herb Solanum, inhibits the growth of human tumor cells. We have previously demonstrated that SM regulates tumor necrosis factor receptors (TNFRs)- and mitochondria-mediated pathways and sensitizes NSCLC cells to initiate apoptosis. Interestingly, this investigation reveals that SM up-regulated Fas expression and down-regulated the expression of HER2, whose overexpression is associated with resistance to drugs, and promotes chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in NSCLC A549 and H441 cells. After treatment with SM, the expression of HER2 mRNA was correlated with the expression of topoisomerase IIalpha (TOP2A) mRNA. The combinatory use of low concentrations of SM with low-toxic topoisomerase II inhibitor epirubicin accelerated apoptotic cell death. Therefore, the downregulation of the HER2 and TOP2A expression by SM with epirubicin may partially explain the SM and epirubicin cytotoxicity synergy effect in NSCLC. Results of this study suggest that SM induces Fas and TNFR-induced NSCLC cell apoptosis and reduces HER2 expression. These findings provide the synergistic therapeutic interaction between SM and epirubicin, suggesting that such combinations may be effectively exploited in future human cancer clinical trials.
15936988	Simvastatin induces interleukin-18 production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.	The effects of statins on immune response depend on the inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A (HMG-CoA) reductase and leukocyte function-associated antigen (LFA)-1, which is a ligand of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1. Simvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor with mild inhibition of LFA-1, induced the production of interleukin (IL)-18, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interferon (IFN)-gamma in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The IL-18 production is located upstream of the cytokine cascade activated by simvastatin. Moreover, simvastatin concentration-dependently inhibited the expression of ICAM-1 and induced the expression of CD40 on monocytes. In the presence of IL-18, simvastatin suppressed the expression of ICAM-1 and CD40 as well as the production of IL-12, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma in PBMC, contributing to the anti-inflammatory effect of simvastatin. The effects of simvastatin were abolished by the addition of the product of the HMG-CoA reductase, mevalonate, indicating the involvement of HMG-CoA reductase in the action of simvastatin.
15155769	Redesign of carnitine acetyltransferase specificity by protein engineering.	In eukaryotes, L-carnitine is involved in energy metabolism by facilitating beta-oxidation of fatty acids. Carnitine acetyltransferases (CrAT) catalyze the reversible conversion of acetyl-CoA and carnitine to acetylcarnitine and free CoA. To redesign the specificity of rat CrAT toward its substrates, we mutated Met564. The M564G mutated CrAT showed higher activity toward longer chain acyl-CoAs: activity toward myristoyl-CoA was 1250-fold higher than that of the wild-type CrAT, and lower activity toward its natural substrate, acetyl-CoA. Kinetic constants of the mutant CrAT showed modification in favor of longer acyl-CoAs as substrates. In the reverse case, mutation of the orthologous glycine (Gly553) to methionine in carnitine octanoyltransferase (COT) decreased activity toward its natural substrates, medium- and long-chain acyl-CoAs, and increased activity toward short-chain acyl-CoAs. Another CrAT mutant, M564A, was prepared and tested in the same way, with similar results. We conclude that Met564 blocks the entry of medium- and long-chain acyl-CoAs to the catalytic site of CrAT. Three-dimensional models of wild-type and mutated CrAT and COT support this hypothesis. We show for the first time that a single amino acid is able to determine the substrate specificity of CrAT and COT.
22080034	Nanosilver effects on growth parameters in experimental aflatoxicosis in broiler chickens.	Aflatoxicosis is a cause of economic losses in broiler production. In this study, the effect of one commercial nanocompound, Nanocid (Nano Nasb Pars Co., Iran) was evaluated in reduction of aflatoxin effects on the growth and performance indices in broiler chickens suffering from experimental aflatoxicosis. For this, a total of 300 one-day-old broiler chicks (Ross strain) were randomly divided into 4 groups with 3 replicates of 15 chicks in each separated pen during the 28-day experiment. Treatment groups including group A: chickens fed basal diet, group B: chickens fed 3 ppm productive aflatoxin in basal diet, group C: chickens fed basal diet plus 2500 ppm Nanocid, and group D: chickens fed 3 ppm productive aflatoxin and 2500 ppm Nanocid, in basal diet. Data on body weight, body weight gain (BWG), feed intake, and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were recorded at weekly intervals. Also cumulative data were assessed. Results showed, although supplement of Nanocid to conventional diet had no effect on performance but addition of Nanocid to diet containing 3 ppm aflatoxin increased significantly the cumulative BWG, cumulative feed consumption and decreased FCR in the last 2 weeks of experimental period. The improvement in these performance indices by supplement of Nanocid to diet containing aflatoxin showed the ability of Nanocid to diminish the inhibitory effects of aflatoxin.
23625750	The effects of the adenosine A3 receptor agonist IB-MECA on sodium taurocholate-induced experimental acute pancreatitis.	The role of adenosine A3 receptors and their distribution in the gastrointestinal tract have been widely investigated. Most of the reports discuss their role in intestinal inflammations. However, the role of adenosine A3 receptor agonist in pancreatitis has not been well established. The aim of this study is (Ed note: Purpose statements should be in present tense) to evaluate the effects of the adenosine A3 receptor agonist on the course of sodium taurocholate-induced experimental acute pancreatitis (EAP). The experiments were performed on 80 male Wistar rats, 58 of which survived, subdivided into 3 groups: C-control rats, I-EAP group, and II-EAP group treated with the adenosine A3 receptor agonist IB-MECA (1-deoxy-1-6[[(3-iodophenyl) methyl]amino]-9H-purin-9-yl)-N-methyl-B-D-ribofuronamide at a dose of 0.75 mg/kg b.w. i.p. at 48, 24, 12 and 1 h before and 1 h after the injection of 5 % sodium taurocholate solution into the biliary-pancreatic duct. Serum for α-amylase and lipase determinations and tissue samples for morphological examinations were collected at 2, 6, and 24 h of the experiment. In the IB-MECA group, α-amylase activity was decreased with statistically high significance compared to group I. The activity of lipase was not significantly different among the experimental groups but higher than in the control group. The administration of IB-MECA attenuated the histological parameters of inflammation as compared to untreated animals. The use of A3 receptor agonist IB-MECA attenuates EAP. Our findings suggest that stimulation of adenosine A3 receptors plays a positive role in the sodium taurocholate-induced EAP in rats.
23305807	Prophylactic effect of resveratrol against ethinylestradiol-induced liver cholestasis.	Estrogens, and particularly glucuronides such as ethinylestradiol (EE), have been shown to cause cholestasis in animal studies, by reducing bile acid uptake by hepatocytes. The aim of the present article was to investigate anticholestatic activity of resveratrol (RES) against liver cholestasis induced by EE in adult female rats. The daily oral administration of the RES at a concentration of 25 mg/kg body weight for 15 days to rats treated with EE (100 μg/kg body weight for 5 days) resulted in a significant protection against EE-induced decrease in both serum cholesterol and bile acid levels as well as against an increase of serum bilirubin concentration. The treatment also resulted in a significant increase in hepatic superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and catalase activities as well as hepatic protein-bound and nonprotein sulfhydryl groups. RES inhibited serum alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, pi-glutathione-S-transferase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, and alpha-glutathione-S-transferase activities, as well as reduced serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha, nitric oxide, and hepatic malondialdehyde as compared to EE-treated rats. The results clearly suggest that RES has a powerful prophylactic action in cholestasis induced by EE. Taken together, RES has potential as a preventive and therapeutic agent for cholestasis and deserves clinical trial in the near future as an adjuvant therapy in women treated with estrogen.
23223177	Dissociation of Bcl-2-Beclin1 complex by activated AMPK enhances cardiac autophagy and protects against cardiomyocyte apoptosis in diabetes.	Diabetic cardiomyopathy is associated with suppression of cardiac autophagy, and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) restores cardiac autophagy and prevents cardiomyopathy in diabetic mice, albeit by an unknown mechanism. We hypothesized that AMPK-induced autophagy ameliorates diabetic cardiomyopathy by inhibiting cardiomyocyte apoptosis and examined the effects of AMPK on the interaction between Beclin1 and Bcl-2, a switch between autophagy and apoptosis, in diabetic mice and high glucose-treated H9c2 cardiac myoblast cells. Exposure of H9c2 cells to high glucose reduced AMPK activity, inhibited Jun NH2-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1)-B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) signaling, and promoted Beclin1 binding to Bcl-2. Conversely, activation of AMPK by metformin stimulated JNK1-Bcl-2 signaling and disrupted the Beclin1-Bcl-2 complex. Activation of AMPK, which normalized cardiac autophagy, attenuated high glucose-induced apoptosis in cultured H9c2 cells. This effect was attenuated by inhibition of autophagy. Finally, chronic administration of metformin in diabetic mice restored cardiac autophagy by activating JNK1-Bcl-2 pathways and dissociating Beclin1 and Bcl-2. The induction of autophagy protected against cardiac apoptosis and improved cardiac structure and function in diabetic mice. We concluded that dissociation of Bcl-2 from Beclin1 may be an important mechanism for preventing diabetic cardiomyopathy via AMPK activation that restores autophagy and protects against cardiac apoptosis.
23407783	The CRF(1) receptor antagonist SSR125543 prevents stress-induced cognitive deficit associated with hippocampal dysfunction: Comparison with paroxetine and D-cycloserine.	RATIONALE: The selective CRF(1) (corticotropin releasing factor type 1) receptor antagonist SSR125543 has been previously shown to attenuate the long-term cognitive deficit produced by traumatic stress exposure. Memory disturbances described in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients are believed to be associated with changes in neuronal activity, in particular at the level of the hippocampus. OBJECTIVES: The present study aims at investigating whether the effects of SSR125543 (10 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks) on cognitive impairment induced by traumatic stress exposure are associated with changes in hippocampal excitability. Effects of SSR125543 were compared to those of the 5-HT reuptake inhibitor, paroxetine (10 mg/kg/day), and the partial N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonist, D-cycloserine (10 mg/kg/day), two compounds which have demonstrated clinical efficacy against PTSD. METHODS: Mice received two unavoidable electric foot-shocks. Then, 1 or 16 days after stress, they were tested for their memory performance using the object recognition test. Neuronal excitability was recorded during the third week post-stress in the CA1 area of the hippocampus. Drugs were administered from day 1 post-stress to the day preceding the electrophysiological study. RESULTS: Application of electric shocks produced cognitive impairment 16, but not 1 day after stress, an effect which was associated with a decrease in hippocampal neuronal excitability. Both stress-induced effects were prevented by repeated administration of SSR125543, paroxetine and D-cycloserine. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm that the CRF(1) receptor antagonist SSR125543 is able to attenuate the behavioral effects of traumatic stress exposure and indicate that these effects are associated with a normalization of hippocampal neuronal excitability impaired by stress.
9557255	A new concept of drug delivery for acne.	Adapalene is a stable naphthoic acid derivative that displays a strong retinoid agonist pharmacology. This drug controls cell proliferation and differentiation, and possesses significant anti-inflammatory action. The retinoid action of adapalene are mediated by the ligand-activated gene transcription factors retinoic acid receptors RAR beta and RAR gamma. We describe here how an aqueous gel containing adapalene was selected for the topical treatment of acne.
12198239	The mineralocorticoid receptor may compensate for the loss of the glucocorticoid receptor at specific stages of mammary gland development.	To study the role of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) at different stages of mammary gland development, mammary anlage were rescued from GR-/- mice by transplantation into the cleared fat pad of wild-type mice. In virgin mice, GR-/- outgrowths displayed abnormal ductal morphogenesis characterized by distended lumena, multiple layers of luminal epithelial cells in some regions along the ducts, and increased periductal stroma. In contrast, the loss of GR did not result in overt phenotypic changes in mammary gland development during pregnancy, lactation, and involution. Surprisingly, despite the known synergism between glucocorticoids and prolactin in the regulation of milk protein gene expression, whey acidic protein and beta-casein mRNA levels were unaffected in GR-/- transplants as compared with wild-type transplants. That mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) might compensate for the loss of GR was suggested by the detection of MR in the mammary gland at d 1 of lactation. This hypothesis was tested using explant cultures derived from the GR-/- transplants in which the mineralocorticoid fludrocortisone was able to synergistically induce beta-casein gene expression in the presence of prolactin and insulin. These studies suggest that MR may compensate for the absence of GR at some, but not at all stages of mammary gland development.
17410123	Presynaptic alpha-2C adrenoceptor-mediated control of noradrenaline release in humans: genotype- or age-dependent?	In vitro alpha-2CDel322-325 adrenoceptor (AR) polymorphism exhibits reduced functional responsiveness. We studied whether this is true also in vivo in humans. We assessed in nine young wild-type (WT) alpha-2C AR subjects (aged 23 years), 10 elder WT alpha-2C AR subjects (aged 63 years), and nine alpha-2CDel AR subjects (aged 28 years) clonidine (1 microg/kg intravenous (i.v.) bolus)-evoked plasma noradrenaline (pNA), heart rate (HR), and blood pressure (BP) changes. Clonidine-evoked pNA decreases were comparable in young WT alpha-2C and in alpha-2CDel AR subjects, but significantly lower (P=0.033) in elder subjects. Similarly, clonidine-evoked HR decreases were significantly larger in young WT alpha-2C and in alpha-2CDel AR subjects than in elder subjects, whereas clonidine-evoked BP decreases were larger in elder subjects. In conclusion, alpha-2CDel AR appears to play only a minor role in presynaptic regulation of NA release and/or to be not hypofunctional in vivo in humans, but functional responsiveness of presynaptic alpha-2 AR declines with ageing.
16426349	The effects of pentoxifylline on the myocardial inflammation and ischemia-reperfusion injury during cardiopulmonary bypass.	BACKGROUND: Pentoxifylline (Ptx) decreases necessity of cell energy and inflammatory reactions via inhibition of 5'-nucleotidase (5'-NT). The aim of this study is to investigate whether the addition of Ptx into the cardioplegic solutions avoids myocardial inflammatory reactions and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury during extracorpereal circulation. METHODS: Between December 1999 and February 2002, we operated 75 patients with the diagnoses of atrial septal defect (ASD), ventricular septal defect (VSD), valve disease, and coronary disease. The average age of patients was 42.4 and male-female ratio was 1: 1.5. The patients were divided into two groups, which were the study group (n = 40) and the control group (n = 35). We used cold blood cardioplegia mixed with St. Thomas' Hospital II cardioplegic solution for both of the groups. Ptx was added into the cardioplegic solution (500 mg/L) in the study group. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and tumor necrotisis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels in coronary sinus blood samples during cross-clamp time (X-clamp) and after releasing of it and tissue TNF-alpha in the right atrial appendix biopsy material that was taken after X-clamp were studied to compare the both groups. RESULTS: After releasing X-clamp, results of blood TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-8 of both groups were statistically significant (p < 0.005). At the pathological examination, we also observed that the amount of tissue TNF-alpha in the control group (66 +/- 17.1) was much higher than the study group (16.6 +/- 5.9, p <0.005). CONCLUSIONS: These results show that Ptx may be added into cardioplegic solution to avoid the myocardial inflammation and I/R injury during open heart surgery.
23537749	Combination of essential oils and antibiotics reduce antibiotic resistance in plasmid-conferred multidrug resistant bacteria.	In this study we investigated the relationship between several selected commercially available essential oils and beta-lactam antibiotics on their antibacterial effect against multidrug resistant bacteria. The antibacterial activity of essential oils and antibiotics was assessed using broth microdilution. The combined effects between essential oils of cinnamon bark, lavender, marjoram, tea tree, peppermint and ampicillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefuroxime, carbenicillin, ceftazidime, meropenem, were evaluated by means of the checkerboard method against beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli. In the latter assays, fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) values were calculated to characterize interaction between the combinations. Substantial susceptibility of the bacteria toward natural antibiotics and a considerable reduction in the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the antibiotics were noted in some paired combinations of antibiotics and essential oils. Out of 35 antibiotic-essential oil pairs tested, four of them showed synergistic effect (FIC≤0.5) and 31 pairs showed no interaction (FIC>0.5-4.0). The preliminary results obtained highlighted the occurrence of a pronounced synergistic relationship between piperacillin/cinnamon bark oil, piperacillin/lavender oil, piperacillin/peppermint oil as well as meropenem/peppermint oil against two of the three bacteria under study with a FIC index in the range 0.26-0.5. The finding highlighted the potential of peppermint, cinnamon bark and lavender essential oils being as antibiotic resistance modifying agent. Reduced usage of antibiotics could be employed as a treatment strategy to decrease the adverse effects and possibly to reverse the beta-lactam antibiotic resistance.
17259377	Salicylate-based anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit the early lesion of diabetic retinopathy.	It has been previously reported that aspirin inhibited the development of diabetic retinopathy in diabetic animals, raising the possibility that anti-inflammatory drugs may have beneficial effects on diabetic retinopathy. To further explore this, we compared effects of oral consumption of three different salicylate-based drugs (aspirin, sodium salicylate, and sulfasalazine) on the development of early stages of diabetic retinopathy in rats. These three drugs differ in their ability to inhibit cyclooxygenase but share an ability to inhibit nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). Diabetes of 9-10 months duration significantly increased the number of TUNEL (transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling)-positive capillary cells and acellular (degenerate) capillaries in the retinal vasculature, and all three salicylate-based drugs inhibited this cell death and formation of acellular capillaries without altering the severity of hyperglycemia. In short-term diabetes (2-4 months), all three salicylates inhibited the diabetes-induced loss of neuronal cells from the ganglion cell layer. Oral aspirin (as a representative of the salicylate family) inhibited diabetes-induced increase in NF-kappaB DNA-binding affinity in electrophoretic mobility shift assay and transcription factor array in nuclear extract isolated from whole retina. All three salicylates inhibited the diabetes-induced translocation of p50 (a subunit of NF-kappaB) into nuclei of retinal vascular endothelial cells of the isolated retinal vasculature, as well as of p50 and p65 into nuclei of cells in the ganglion cell layer and inner nuclear layer on whole-retinal sections. Sulfasalazine (also as a representative of the salicylates) inhibited the diabetes-induced upregulation of several inflammatory gene products, which are regulated by NF-kappaB, including vascular cell adhesion molecule, intracellular adhesion molecule-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and cyclooxygenase-2 in whole-retinal lysate. Salicylates, in doses administrated in our experiments, inhibited NF-kappaB and perhaps other transcription factors in the retina, were well tolerated, and offered new tools to investigate and inhibit the development of diabetic retinopathy.
17006762	Kinetic parameters and lactate dehydrogenase isozyme activities support possible lactate utilization by neurons.	Lactate is potentially a major energy source in brain, particularly following hypoxia/ischemia; however, the regulation of brain lactate metabolism is not well understood. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isozymes in cytosol from primary cultures of neurons and astrocytes, and freshly isolated synaptic terminals (synaptosomes) from adult rat brain were separated by electrophoresis, visualized with an activity-based stain, and quantified. The activity and kinetics of LDH were determined in the same preparations. In synaptosomes, the forward reaction (pyruvate + NADH + H(+ )--> lactate + NAD(+)), which had a V (max) of 1,163 micromol/min/mg protein was 62% of the rate in astrocyte cytoplasm. In contrast, the reverse reaction (lactate + NAD(+ )--> pyruvate + NADH + H(+)), which had a V (max) of 268 micromol/min/mg protein was 237% of the rate in astrocytes. Although the relative distribution was different, all five isozymes of LDH were present in synaptosomes and primary cultures of cortical neurons and astrocytes from rat brain. LDH1 was 14.1% of the isozyme in synaptic terminals, but only 2.6% and 2.4% in neurons and astrocytes, respectively. LDH5 was considerably lower in synaptic terminals than in neurons and astrocytes, representing 20.4%, 37.3% and 34.8% of the isozyme in these preparations, respectively. The distribution of LDH isozymes in primary cultures of cortical neurons does not directly reflect the kinetics of LDH and the capacity for lactate oxidation. However, the kinetics of LDH in brain are consistent with the possible release of lactate by astrocytes and oxidative use of lactate for energy in synaptic terminals.
19337422	Tolvaptan and its potential in the treatment of hyponatremia.	Tolvaptan is a selective arginine vasopressin (AVP) V(2) receptor blocker used to induce free water diuresis in the treatment of euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia. Currently the orally active medication is in the final stages prior to approval by the FDA for outpatient therapy. It appears to be safe and effective at promoting aquaresis and raising serum sodium levels in both short- and long-term studies. Tolvaptan is also effective for treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, but whether there are long standing beneficial effects on CHF is still controversial. Prolonged use of tolvaptan leads to increased endogenous levels of AVP and perhaps over-stimulation of V(1A) receptors. Theoretically this activation could lead to increased afterload and cardiac myocyte fibrosis, causing progression of CHF. However, after 52 weeks of tolvaptan therapy there was no worsening of left ventricular dilatation. In addition, tolvaptan is metabolized by the CYP3A4 system; thus physicians should be aware of the potential for increased interactions with other medications. Tolvaptan is a breakthrough in the therapy of hyponatremia as it directly combats elevated AVP levels associated with the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, congestive heart failure, and cirrhosis of the liver.
16262557	The unexpected side effects of new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.	Conventional nonselective NSAIDs are classically associated with a risk of gastrointestinal disorders. These drugs have a broad range of relative selectivity towards the COX family, mainly towards two isoforms of these enzymes: COX-1 and -2. As examples, ketorolac, flurbiprofen, ketoprofen and indomethacin have increased COX-1 selectivity when compared with naproxen and ibuprofen.
15953344	Monocarboxylate transporters in the central nervous system: distribution, regulation and function.	Monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) are proton-linked membrane carriers involved in the transport of monocarboxylates such as lactate, pyruvate, as well as ketone bodies. They belong to a larger family of transporters composed of 14 members in mammals based on sequence homologies. MCTs are found in various tissues including the brain where three isoforms, MCT1, MCT2 and MCT4, have been described. Each of these isoforms exhibits a distinct regional and cellular distribution in rodent brain. At the cellular level, MCT1 is expressed by endothelial cells of microvessels, by ependymocytes as well as by astrocytes. MCT4 expression appears to be specific for astrocytes. By contrast, the predominant neuronal monocarboxylate transporter is MCT2. Interestingly, part of MCT2 immunoreactivity is located at postsynaptic sites, suggesting a particular role of monocarboxylates and their transporters in synaptic transmission. In addition to variation in expression during development and upon nutritional modifications, new data indicate that MCT expression is regulated at the translational level by neurotransmitters. Understanding how transport of monocarboxylates is regulated could be of particular importance not only for neuroenergetics but also for areas such as functional brain imaging, regulation of food intake and glucose homeostasis, or for central nervous system disorders such as ischaemia and neurodegenerative diseases.
15465654	Viability assessment in sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes after xenobiotic exposure.	Troglitazone, bosentan and glibenclamide inhibit the bile salt export pump (Bsep) which transports taurocholate into bile. Sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes maintain functional sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide and Bsep transport proteins, and may be useful to study inhibition of transport by xenobiotics at concentrations below the lowest observable adverse effect level (LOAEL). The purpose of this study was to compare viability assessments determined with the neutral red, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alamar blue, 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and propidium iodide assays in sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes following exposure to xenobiotics known to inhibit Bsep, and to define the LOAEL for these xenobiotics in this system. The neutral red assay was not amenable to use in this model due to crystal formation on the collagen. Troglitazone decreased viability in every assay examined, with a LOAEL approximately 100 microM. Bosentan also decreased viability as measured by the LDH, MTT and propidium iodide assays, with a LOAEL approximately 200 microM; however, a significant decrease in viability was not observed with the alamar blue assay. Glibenclamide did not decrease viability with any assay at the xenobiotic concentrations examined in this study. Based on the results of this study, the LDH or propidium iodide assays would be the methods of choice to assess viability in sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes after xenobiotic exposure.
11518758	Impaired synthesis of DHA in patients with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa.	Many patients with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP) have lower than normal blood levels of the long-chain polyunsaturated omega3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6omega3). This clinical trial was designed to test whether down-regulation of DHA biosynthesis might be responsible for these reduced DHA levels. DHA biosynthesis was assessed in five severely affected patients with XLRP and in five age-matched controls by quantifying conversion of [U-(13)C]alpha-linolenic acid (alpha-LNA) to [(13)C]DHA. Following oral administration of [U-(13)C]alpha-LNA, blood samples were collected at designated intervals for 21 days and isotopic enrichment of all omega3 fatty acids was determined by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy. Activity of each metabolic step in the conversion of alpha-LNA to DHA was determined by comparison of the ratios of the integrated concentration of (13)C-product to (13)C-precursor in plasma total lipid fractions. The ratio of [(13)C]DHA to [(13)C]18:3omega3 (the entire pathway) and that of [(13)C]20:5omega3 to [(13)C]20:4omega3 (Delta(5)-desaturase) were significantly lower in patients versus controls (P = 0.03 and 0.05, respectively). The estimated biosynthetic rates of [(13)C]20:5omega3, [(13)C]22:5omega3, [(13)C]24:5omega3, [(13)C]24:6omega3, and [(13)C]22:6omega3 were significantly lower in XLRP patients (42%, 43%, 31%, 18%, and 32% of control values, respectively; P < 0.04), supporting down-regulation of Delta(5)-desaturase in XLRP. The disappearance of (13)C-labeled fatty acids from plasma was not greater in XLRP patients compared with controls, suggesting that XLRP was not associated with increased rates of fatty acid oxidation or other routes of catabolism.Thus, despite individual variation among both patients and controls, the data are consistent with a lower rate of Delta(5)-desaturation, suggesting that decreased biosynthesis of DHA may contribute to lower blood levels of DHA in patients with XLRP.
12545144	Effects of age and sex on the disposition of retigabine.	BACKGROUND: The novel antiepileptic drug retigabine is the first selective M-current potassium channel opener for KCNQ2/3 and KCNQ3/5 channels. Retigabine undergoes phase II metabolism (N-glucuronidation, acetylation) exclusively and renal excretion. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate the effects of age and sex on the pharmacokinetics of retigabine. METHODS: Healthy young (age range, 18-40 years) and elderly (age range, 66-81 years) white subjects (12 men and 12 women in each group) received a single 200-mg oral dose of retigabine. After dosing, blood was collected over a 72-hour period to determine plasma concentrations of retigabine and its acetylated metabolite, AWD21-360. Pharmacokinetics was compared for age group and sex by ANOVA. RESULTS: In young men, retigabine was rapidly absorbed, with the maximum concentration occurring within 2 hours, and was eliminated with an apparent clearance of 0.67 L x h(-1) x kg(-1) and a mean terminal half-life of 8.5 hours. Subjects were similarly exposed to AWD21-360. Compared with young men, young women had higher retigabine maximum concentration (56%) and exposure (20%) but similar clearance (0.68 L x h(-1) x kg(-1)); these differences were related to differences in body weight. Although maximum concentration was similar in elderly subjects, retigabine elimination was slower (30% lower apparent clearance normalized for weight), resulting in higher exposure (42%) and a longer half-life (30%). Because phase II metabolism is scarcely affected by age, these differences may be related to the known decline of renal function with age. CONCLUSIONS: Although there are no substantial sex-related differences in the disposition of retigabine, a relevant decrease in clearance resulting in higher exposure occurs in elderly patients. The results suggest that decline of renal function with age may account for some of the observed changes.
16547010	Structural and functional characterization of HQL-79, an orally selective inhibitor of human hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase.	We determined the crystal structure of human hematopoietic prostaglandin (PG) D synthase (H-PGDS) as the quaternary complex with glutathione (GSH), Mg2+, and an inhibitor, HQL-79, having anti-inflammatory activities in vivo, at a 1.45-A resolution. In the quaternary complex, HQL-79 was found to reside within the catalytic cleft between Trp104 and GSH. HQL-79 was stabilized by interaction of a phenyl ring of its diphenyl group with Trp104 and by its piperidine group with GSH and Arg14 through water molecules, which form a network with hydrogen bonding and salt bridges linked to Mg2+. HQL-79 inhibited human H-PGDS competitively against the substrate PGH2 and non-competitively against GSH with Ki of 5 and 3 microm, respectively. Surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed that HQL-79 bound to H-PGDS with an affinity that was 12-fold higher in the presence of GSH and Mg2+ (Kd, 0.8 microm) than in their absence. Mutational studies revealed that Arg14 was important for the Mg2+-mediated increase in the binding affinity of H-PGDS for HQL-79, and that Trp104, Lys112, and Lys198 were important for maintaining the HQL-binding pocket. HQL-79 selectively inhibited PGD2 production by H-PGDS-expressing human megakaryocytes and rat mastocytoma cells with an IC50 value of about 100 microm but only marginally affected the production of other prostanoids, suggesting the tight functional engagement between H-PGDS and cyclooxygenase. Orally administered HQL-79 (30 mg/kg body weight) inhibited antigen-induced production of PGD2, without affecting the production of PGE2 and PGF2alpha, and ameliorated airway inflammation in wild-type and human H-PGDS-overexpressing mice. Knowledge about this structure of quaternary complex is useful for understanding the inhibitory mechanism of HQL-79 and should accelerate the structure-based development of novel anti-inflammatory drugs that inhibit PGD2 production specifically.
22815312	Quantitative prediction of CYP2B6 induction by estradiol during pregnancy: potential explanation for increased methadone clearance during pregnancy.	There is considerable evidence that pregnancy changes the disposition of drugs in an enzyme- and gestational stage-specific manner. On the basis of probe drug studies, the activity of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 increases and CYP1A2 decreases during human pregnancy. However, no studies of CYP2B6 activity during human pregnancy have been conducted. In rodent models and in HepG2 cells, CYP2B enzymes have been shown to be regulated by estradiol. Because estradiol concentrations increase by ∼50-fold during human pregnancy, it was hypothesized that the increasing estradiol concentrations during human pregnancy would result in induction of CYP2B6 activity. Hepatocytes from three female donors were treated with estradiol, and the EC(50) and E(max) were measured for CYP2B6 mRNA and bupropion hydroxylation activity. The measured values were used to predict the magnitude of CYP2B6 induction during human pregnancy. At 100 nM total estradiol, a concentration achievable during the third trimester of pregnancy, CYP2B6 activity was predicted to increase by 1.5-3-fold, based on increased CYP2B6 activity and mRNA. When the E(max) and EC(50) values were compared with those for carbamazepine and rifampin, estradiol was found to be as potent an inducer of CYP2B6 as rifampin and carbamazepine. These data suggest that, during human pregnancy, the increasing estradiol concentrations will result in increased clearance of drugs that have CYP2B6-mediated clearance pathways. This could in part explain the observed increase in methadone clearance during pregnancy.
23583910	Aminopropylindenes derived from Grundmann's ketone as a novel chemotype of oxidosqualene cyclase inhibitors.	A series of aminopropylindenes, designed as mimics of a cationic high energy intermediate in the oxidosqualene cyclase(1) (OSC)-mediated cyclization of 2,3-oxidosqualen to lanosterol was prepared from Grundmann's ketone. Screening on OSCs from five different organisms revealed interesting activities and selectivities of some of the compounds. A N,N-dimethylaminopropyl derivative showed promising inhibition of Trypanosoma cruzi OSC in combination with low cytotoxicity, and showed significant reduction of cholesterol biosynthesis in a human cell line.
23608737	Estradiol replacement enhances cocaine-stimulated locomotion in female C57BL/6 mice through estrogen receptor alpha.	Psychostimulant effects are enhanced by ovarian hormones in women and female rodents. Estradiol increases behavioral responses to psychostimulants in women and female rats, although the underlying mechanism is unknown. This study utilized mice to investigate the time frame and receptor mediation of estradiol's enhancement of cocaine-induced behavior as mice enable parallel use of genetic, surgical and pharmacological methods. The spontaneous behavior of Sham and Ovariectomized (Ovx) female wildtype (WT) mice was determined during habituation to a novel environment and after cocaine administration. Ovx mice were replaced with vehicle (sesame oil) or 17β-estradiol (E2) for 2 days or 30 min prior to a cocaine challenge to investigate the time course of E2's effects. To examine receptor mediation of estradiol effects, Ovx mice replaced for 2 days with either the ERα-selective agonist PPT or the ERβ-selective agonist DPN were compared to Sham mice, and mice lacking either ERα (αERKO) or ERβ (βERKO) were compared to WT littermates. Ovx mice exhibited fewer ambulations during habituation than Sham females. Cocaine-induced increases in behavioral ratings were greater in Sham than in Ovx mice. Two days but not 30 min of E2 replacement in Ovx mice increased cocaine responses to Sham levels. PPT replacement also increased the cocaine response relative to vehicle- or DPN- treated Ovx mice. αERKO mice displayed modestly attenuated behavioral responses to novelty and cocaine compared to αWT littermates, but no behavioral differences were found between βERKO and βWT mice. These results suggest that E2 enhances cocaine-stimulated locomotion in mice predominantly through ERα.
16722247	The norepinephrine transporter in physiology and disease.	The norepinephrine transporter (NET) terminates noradrenergic signalling by rapid re-uptake of neuronally released norepinephrine (NE) into presynaptic terminals. NET exerts a fine regulated control over NE-mediated behavioural and physiological effects including mood, depression, feeding behaviour, cognition, regulation of blood pressure and heart rate. NET is a target of several drugs which are therapeutically used in the treatment or diagnosis of disorders among which depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and feeding disturbances are the most common. Individual genetic variations in the gene encoding the human NET (hNET), located at chromosome 16q12.2, may contribute to the pathogenesis of those diseases. An increasing number of studies concerning the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the hNET gene and their potential association with disease as well as the functional investigation of naturally occurring or induced amino acid variations in hNET have contributed to a better understanding of NET function, regulation and genetic contribution to disorders. This review will reflect the current knowledge in the field of NET from its initial discovery until now.
9040115	Endogenous opioid systems and alcohol addiction.	Alcohol exerts numerous pharmacological effects through its interaction with various neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. Among the latter, the endogenous opioids play a key role in the rewarding (addictive) properties of ethanol. Three types of opioid receptors (mu, delta and kappa) represent the respective targets of the major opioid peptides (beta-endorphin, enkephalins and dynorphins, respectively). The rewarding (reinforcing) properties of mu- and delta-receptor ligands are brought by activation of the mesolimbic dopamine system which ascends from the ventral tegmentum of the midbrain (VTA) to rostral structures; of these, the nucleus accumbens (NAC) is of particular importance in drug addiction. In contrast, dysphoria results from activation of kappa-receptors. The neurochemical manifestations of these opposing effects are, respectively, increases and decreases in dopamine release in the NAC. Several lines of evidence indicate that alcohol interferes with endogenous opioid mechanisms which are closely linked with dopamine transmission in the mesolimbic pathway. The view that condensation products of dopamine and alcohol-derived aldehyde (tetrahydroisoquinolines) play a role remains controversial. There is, however, much information on the direct (acute and chronic) effects of alcohol on the binding properties of opioid receptors, as well as modulation of opioid peptide synthesis and secretion (e.g. a suggested increase in beta-endorphin release). In view of the reinforcing properties of alcohol, it is relevant to consider behavioural studies involving alcohol self-administration in rodents and primates. Low doses of morphine have been found to increase, and higher doses of the opiate to decrease, alcohol consumption. Conversely, opioid antagonists such as naloxone and naltrexone (which bind to non-selectively opioid receptors) have been shown to decrease alcohol consumption under various experimental conditions. Similar results have been reported when selective mu- or delta-receptor antagonists are administered. Results obtained in genetic models of high preference for alcohol also support the view that alcohol intake depends on the activity of the endogenous opioid reward system and that alcohol consumption may serve to compensate for inherent deficits in this system. One hypothetical model proposes that reward results from activation of mu-opioid receptors in the VTA and/or delta-receptor in the NAC; both these nuclei are targets of endogenous beta-endorphin. It is suggested that alcohol interferes with this reward pathway either directly or indirectly. The available experimental data accord well with those obtained from clinical studies which opioid antagonists have been used to prevent relapse in alcoholics. Conceptual considerations concerning communalities between various forms of addictions are also discussed in this review.
2362440	Affinity alkylation of human placental 3 beta-hydroxy-5-ene-steroid dehydrogenase and steroid 5----4-ene-isomerase by 2 alpha-bromoacetoxyprogesterone: evidence for separate dehydrogenase and isomerase sites on one protein.	We have copurified human placental 3 beta-hydroxy-5-ene-steroid dehydrogenase and steroid 5----4-ene-isomerase, which synthesize progesterone from pregnenolone and androstenedione from fetal dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, from microsomes as a homogeneous protein based on electrophoretic and NH2-terminal sequencing data. The affinity alkylator, 2 alpha-bromoacetoxyprogesterone, simultaneously inactivates the pregnene and androstene dehydrogenase activities as well as the C21 and C19 isomerase activities in a time-dependent, irreversible manner following first order kinetics. At four concentrations (50/1-20/1 steroid/enzyme M ratios), the alkylator inactivates the dehydrogenase activity (t1/2 = 1.5-3.7 min) 2-fold faster than the isomerase activity. Pregnenolone and dehydroepiandrosterone protect the dehydrogenase activity, while 5-pregnene-3,20-dione, progesterone, and androstenedione protect isomerase activity from inactivation. The protection studies and competitive kinetics of inhibition demonstrate that the affinity alkylator is active site-directed. Kitz and Wilson analyses show that 2 alpha-bromoacetoxyprogesterone inactivates the dehydrogenase activity by a bimolecular mechanism (k3' = 160.9 l/mol.s), while the alkylator inactivates isomerase by a unimolecular mechanism (Ki = 0.14 mM, k3 = 0.013 s-1). Pregnenolone completely protects the dehydrogenase activity but does not slow the rate of isomerase inactivation by 2 alpha-bromoacetoxyprogesterone at all. NADH completely protects both activities from inactivation by the alkylator, while NAD+ protects neither. From Dixon analysis, NADH competitively inhibits NAD+ reduction by dehydrogenase activity. Mixed cofactor studies show that isomerase binds NAD+ and NADH at a common site. Therefore, NADH must not protect either activity by simply binding at the cofactor site. We postulate that NADH binding as an allosteric activator of isomerase protects both the dehydrogenase and isomerase activities from affinity alkylation by inducing a conformational change in the enzyme protein. The human placental enzyme appears to express the pregnene and androstene dehydrogenase activities at one site and the C21 and C19 isomerase activities at a second site on the same protein.
23314308	Electrical field stimulation (EFS)-induced relaxations turn into contractions upon removal of extracellular calcium in rat mesenteric artery.	In the present study, we aimed to examine the effect of blockade of L-type Ca(2+) channels (LTCC) and in addition the removal of extracellular Ca(2+), on EFS-induced relaxations in rings of rat mesenteric artery. EFS applied to the tissues precontracted with phenylephrine caused relaxations which were markedly inhibited by nifedipine (10(-7)M) and tetraethylammonium (TEA) (1mM). Addition of LTCC opener BAY K 8644 (10(-7)M) failed to enhance the relaxations. Upon removal of Ca(2+), EFS with the same stimulation parameters produced frequency-dependent transient contractions. Tetrodotoxin (10(-6)M), capsaicin (10(-5)M) and removal of endothelium did not alter these contractions suggesting that they were not neural in origin and endothelium-derived contracting factors were unlikely to be involved. However, they were increased by nearly 40% in response to BAY K 8644 (10(-7)M) and were inhibited by nifedipine (10(-7)M), indicating that activation of the LTCCs was essential. Inositol triphosphate (InsP3) receptor antagonist 2-APB (10(-4)M) significantly reduced, and high concentration of caffeine (20mM) almost totally suppressed the contractions. These results suggest that in the absence of extracellular Ca(2+) EFS through membrane depolarization, evokes the opening of the LTCCs which subsequently leads to the release of Ca(2+) from internal stores via InsP3 receptors, a phenomenon known as Ca(2+) channel-induced Ca(2+) release (CCICR), to trigger vasoconstriction. That activation of LTCCs causes arterial relaxation or contraction depending on the Ca(2+) status apparently exemplifies how the same messenger fulfils opposing physiological functions in a given cell.
23541928	Osteochondral tissue regeneration using a bilayered composite hydrogel with modulating dual growth factor release kinetics in a rabbit model.	Biodegradable oligo(poly(ethylene glycol) fumarate) (OPF) composite hydrogels have been investigated for the delivery of growth factors (GFs) with the aid of gelatin microparticles (GMPs) and stem cell populations for osteochondral tissue regeneration. In this study, a bilayered OPF composite hydrogel that mimics the distinctive hierarchical structure of native osteochondral tissue was utilized to investigate the effect of transforming growth factor-β3 (TGF-β3) with varying release kinetics and/or insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) on osteochondral tissue regeneration in a rabbit full-thickness osteochondral defect model. The four groups investigated included (i) a blank control (no GFs), (ii) GMP-loaded IGF-1 alone, (iii) GMP-loaded IGF-1 and gel-loaded TGF-β3, and (iv) GMP-loaded IGF-1 and GMP-loaded TGF-β3 in OPF composite hydrogels. The results of an in vitro release study demonstrated that TGF-β3 release kinetics could be modulated by the GF incorporation method. At 12weeks post-implantation, the quality of tissue repair in both chondral and subchondral layers was analyzed based on quantitative histological scoring. All groups incorporating GFs resulted in a significant improvement in cartilage morphology compared to the control. Single delivery of IGF-1 showed higher scores in subchondral bone morphology as well as chondrocyte and glycosaminoglycan amount in adjacent cartilage tissue when compared to a dual delivery of IGF-1 and TGF-β3, independent of the TGF-β3 release kinetics. The results suggest that although the dual delivery of TGF-β3 and IGF-1 may not synergistically enhance the quality of engineered tissue, the delivery of IGF-1 alone from bilayered composite hydrogels positively affects osteochondral tissue repair and holds promise for osteochondral tissue engineering applications.
23352650	Point-to-point ligand-receptor interactions across the subunit interface modulate the induction and stabilization of conformational states of alpha7 nAChR by benzylidene anabaseines.	The homomeric α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is a well-studied therapeutic target, though its characteristically rapid desensitization complicates the development of drugs with specific agonist effects. Moreover, some experimental compounds such as GTS-21 (2,4diMeOBA), a derivative of the α7-selective partial agonist benzylidene anabaseine (BA), produce a prolonged residual desensitization (RD) in which the receptor remains non-activatable long after the drug has been removed from extracellular solution. In contrast, the desensitization caused by GTS-21's dihydroxy metabolite (2,4diOHBA) is relatively short-lived. RD is hypothetically due to stable binding of the ligand to the receptor in its desensitized state. We can attribute the reduction in RD to a single BA hydroxyl group on the 4' benzylidene position. Computational prediction derived from homology modeling showed the serine36 (S36) residue of α7 as a reasonable candidate for point-to-point interaction between BA compounds and the receptor. Through evaluating the activity of BA and simple derivatives on wild-type and mutant α7 receptors, it was observed that the drug-receptor pairs which were capable of hydrogen bonding at residue 36 exhibited significantly less stable desensitization. Further experiments involving the type II positive allosteric modulator (PAM) PNU-120596 showed that the various BA compounds' preference to induce either a PAM-sensitive (D(s)) or PAM-insensitive (D(i)) desensitized state is concentration dependent and suggested that both states are destabilized by S36 H-bonding. These results indicate that the fine-tuning of agonists for specific interaction with S36 can facilitate the development of therapeutics with targeted effects on ion channel desensitization properties and conformational state stability.
23484434	Progress and Developments in Tau Aggregation Inhibitors for Alzheimer Disease.	Pharmacological approaches directed toward Alzheimer disease are diversifying in parallel with a growing number of promising targets. Investigations on the microtubule-associated protein tau yielded innovative targets backed by recent findings about the central role of tau in numerous neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we summarize the recent evolution in the development of nonpeptidic small molecules tau aggregation inhibitors (TAGIs) and their advancement toward clinical trials. The compounds are classified according to their chemical structures, providing correlative insights into their pharmacology. Overall, shared structure-activity traits are emerging, as well as specific binding modes related to their ability to engage in hydrogen bonding. Medicinal chemistry efforts on TAGIs together with encouraging in vivo data argue for successful translation to the clinic.
16899342	The P/Q-type voltage-dependent calcium channel as pharmacological target in spinocerebellar ataxia type 6: gabapentin and pregabalin may be of therapeutic benefit.	Voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs) are heteromultimeric complexes that mediate calcium influx into cells in response to changes in membrane potential. The alpha1A subunit, encoded by the CACNA1A gene, is the pore-forming subunit specific to the neuronal P/Q-type VDCCs. These are implicated in fast excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. Their highest levels of expression are found in the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum, and in the hippocampus. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA 6) is an autosomal dominant cerebellar degeneration that shares neuropathological findings with late-onset cortical cerebellar atrophy (CCA). It is caused by an abnormal expansion of a trinucleotide (CAG) repeat in exon 47 of CACNA1A, on chromosome 19p13. This translates into a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract of prolonged length in the carboxyl terminal of the alpha1A subunit. Heterologous expression of mutated alpha1A subunits results in increased channel inactivation in electrophysiological tests. No treatment is known to improve SCA 6 at present, as none of the available drugs is able to reverse alpha1A dysregulation, nor disturbed protein aggregation, transport and localization in this disease. The drugs gabapentin and pregabalin interact with the alpha2delta subunit of the P/Q-type VDCCs. Gabapentin and pregabalin slow the rate of inactivation in recombinant P/Q-type VDCCs, expressed in Xenopus oocytes. These drugs improve ataxia in cases of CCA, olivopontocerebellar atrophy and ataxia-telangiectasia. On the basis of the neuropathological identity of SCA 6 with CCA, and given the capacity of gabapentin and pregabalin to decrease P/Q-type VDCCs inactivation, in this paper the authors put forward the hypothesis that the administration of gabapentin and pregabalin might prove beneficial in SCA 6 as the ataxia caused by this disease would be expected to improve. The authors hope that researchers working with this illness will be inspired and encouraged to undertake the appropriate clinical and experimental work.
23566515	Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of 2-amino-3-carboxy-4-phenylthiophenes as novel atypical protein kinase C inhibitors.	Recent evidence suggests atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) isoforms are required for both TNF- and VEGF-induced breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) and endothelial permeability to 70kDa dextran or albumin. A chemical library screen revealed a series of novel small molecule phenylthiophene based inhibitors of aPKC isoforms that effectively block permeability in cell culture and in vivo. In an effort to further elucidate the structural requirements of this series of inhibitors, we detail in this study a structure-activity relationship (SAR) built on screening hit 1, which expands on our initial pharmacophore model. The biological activity of our analogues was evaluated in models of bona fide aPKC-dependent signaling including NFκB driven-gene transcription as a marker for an inflammatory response and VEGF/TNF-induced vascular endothelial permeability. The EC50 for the most efficacious inhibitors (6, 32) was in the low nanomolar range in these two cellular assays. Our study demonstrates the key structural elements that confer inhibitory activity and highlights the requirement for electron-donating moieties off the C-4 aryl moiety of the 2-amino-3-carboxy-4-phenylthiophene backbone. These studies suggest that this class has potential for further development into small molecule aPKC inhibitors with therapeutic efficacy in a host of diseases involving increased vascular permeability and inflammation.
22902307	A human hemi-cornea model for eye irritation testing: quality control of production, reliability and predictive capacity.	We have developed a 3-dimensional human hemi-cornea which comprises an immortalized epithelial cell line and keratocytes embedded in a collagen stroma. In the present study, we have used MTT reduction of the whole tissue to clarify whether the production of this complex 3-D-model is transferable into other laboratories and whether these tissues can be constructed reproducibly. Our results demonstrate the reproducible production of the hemi-cornea model according to standard operation procedures using 15 independent batches of reconstructed hemi-cornea models in two independent laboratories each. Furthermore, the hemi-cornea tissues have been treated with 20 chemicals of different eye-irritating potential under blind conditions to assess the performance and limitations of our test system comparing three different prediction models. The most suitable prediction model revealed an overall in vitro-in vivo concordance of 80% and 70% in the participating laboratories, respectively, and an inter-laboratory concordance of 80%. Sensitivity of the test was 77% and specificity was between 57% and 86% to discriminate classified from non-classified chemicals. We conclude that additional physiologically relevant endpoints in both epithelium and stroma have to be developed for the reliable prediction of all GHS classes of eye irritation in one stand alone test system.
17705025	High frequency of missense mutations in glycogen storage disease type VI.	Deficiency of liver glycogen phosphorylase in glycogen storage disease (GSD) type VI results in a reduced ability to mobilize glucose from glycogen. Six mutations of the PYGL gene, which encodes the liver isoform of the enzyme, have been identified in the literature. We have characterized eight patients from seven families with GSD type VI and identified 11 novel PYGL gene defects. The majority of the mutations were missense, resulting in the substitution of highly conserved residues. These could be grouped into those that were predicted to affect substrate binding (p.V456M, p.E673K, p.S675L, p.S675T), pyridoxal phosphate binding (p.R491C, p.K681T), or activation of glycogen phosphorylase (p.Q13P) or that had an unknown effect (p.N632I and p.D634H). Two mutations were predicted to result in null alleles, p.R399X and [c.1964_1969inv6;c.1969+1_+4delGTAC]. Only 7 of the 23 (30%) reported PYGL alleles carry nonsense, splice site or frameshift mutations compared to 68-80% of affected alleles of the highly homologous muscle glycogen phosphorylase gene, PYGM, that underlie McArdle disease. There was heterogeneity in the clinical symptoms observed in affected individuals. These varied from hepatomegaly and subclinical hypoglycaemia, to severe hepatomegaly with recurrent severe hypoglycaemia and postprandial lactic acidosis. We conclude that deficiency of liver glycogen phosphorylase is predominantly the result of missense mutations affecting enzyme activity. There are no common mutations and the severity of clinical symptoms varies significantly.
10768100	Troglitazone reduces plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 expression and secretion in cultured human adipocytes.	AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Increased plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) concentrations are characteristic for subjects with insulin resistance and could contribute to the increased cardiovascular risk in this state. In this study, we investigated the effect of troglitazone, a ligand of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma, on PAI-1 expression and secretion in human adipocytes. METHODS: We used two models: in vitro differentiated subcutaneous and omental adipocytes cultured under serum-free conditions and isolated subcutaneous and omental fat cells kept in suspension culture. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 protein was measured by ELISA, PAI-1 mRNA by a semiquantitative RT-PCR technique. RESULTS: Exposure of in vitro differentiated subcutaneous adipocytes from young normal-weight females to 1 microgram/ml troglitazone for 72 h caused a reduction of both PAI-1 secretion (by 29 +/- 5%; p < 0.01) and PAI-1 mRNA expression (by 26 +/- 3%; p < 0.05). In cultures from severely obese subjects, troglitazone induced a decrease of PAI-1 antigen secretion from newly differentiated omental adipocytes by 49 +/- 8% (p < 0.01) and from subcutaneous adipocytes by 30 +/- 7% (p < 0.05). Exposure of freshly isolated subcutaneous and omental adipocytes in suspension culture to troglitazone induced a similar reduction of PAI-1 concentration in the culture medium (by 35 +/- 11%, p < 0.05, and 33 +/- 8%, p < 0.05 compared with control, respectively). CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: This study provides evidence that troglitazone reduces PAI-1 production in human adipocytes, probably at the transcriptional level. This observation could point to a new beneficial effect of troglitazone, particularly in obese subjects, which could be associated with a reduced cardiovascular risk.
8741039	Atypical vitamin B12-unresponsive methylmalonic aciduria in sibship with severe progressive encephalomyelopathy: a new genetic disease?	UNLABELLED: We report on two siblings, a girl of 7 years and a boy of 2 years, who presented in infancy with hypotonia, athetoid movements, myopathy and severe developmental delay. The progressive clinical course was characterized by ophthalmoplegia, pyramidal tract signs, loss of visual contact and failure to thrive. The older sister died at the age of 7 years. The younger brother followed an almost identical clinical course. MRI of the brain revealed bilateral hypodensities and atrophy of the putamen. Neurophysiological investigations were consistent with peripheral neuropathy. Investigations for neurometabolic disorders in urine, plasma and CSF of both patients revealed a consistent increase of methylmalonic acid in urine, plasma and CSF as well as borderline low free GABA in CSF. Except for an inconstant elevation of lactate in the boy, metabolic acidosis, hypoglycaemia, episodic ketoacidosis, or hyperammonaemia, the usual concomitants of organoacidopathies, were absent in both children. Homocystinuria was excluded. Methylmalonic aciduria did not respond to antibiotic treatment, vitamin B12 therapy nor dietary protein restriction. Incorporation of [14C]propionate into protein in cultured fibroblasts was pathologically but inconsistently decreased. Both patients' cell lines showed only minimal response to hydroxocobalamin and normal methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity. CONCLUSION: Even though the definitive underlying enzymatic defect in this sibship remains obscure our results suggest a new genetic disorder. This report illustrates that hitherto undescribed metabolic disorders remain to be elucidated even in long investigated areas of intermediary metabolism such as methylmalonic aciduria.
23000249	Snake venom metalloproteinases.	"Recent proteomic analyses of snake venoms show that metalloproteinases represent major components in most of the Crotalid and Viperid venoms. In this chapter we discuss the multiple activities of the SVMPs. In addition to hemorrhagic activity, members of the SVMP family also have fibrin(ogen)olytic activity, act as prothrombin activators, activate blood coagulation factor X, possess apoptotic activity, inhibit platelet aggregation, are pro-inflammatory and inactivate blood serine proteinase inhibitors. Clearly the SVMPs have multiple functions in addition to their well-known hemorrhagic activity. The realization that there are structural variations in the SVMPs and the early studies that led to their classification represents an important event in our understanding of the structural forms of the SVMPs. The SVMPs were subdivided into the P-I, P-II and P-III protein classes. The noticeable characteristic that distinguished the different classes was their size (molecular weight) differences and domain structure: Class I (P-I), the small SVMPs, have molecular masses of 20-30 kDa, contain only a pro domain and the proteinase domain; Class II (P-II), the medium size SVMPs, molecular masses of 30-60 kDa, contain the pro domain, proteinase domain and disintegrin domain; Class III (P-III), the large SVMPs, have molecular masses of 60-100 kDa, contain pro, proteinase, disintegrin-like and cysteine-rich domain structure. Another significant advance in the SVMP field was the characterization of the crystal structure of the first P-I class SVMP. The structures of other P-I SVMPs soon followed and the structures of P-III SVMPs have also been determined. The active site of the metalloproteinase domain has a consensus HEXXHXXGXXHD sequence and a Met-turn. The ""Met-turn"" structure contains a conserved Met residue that forms a hydrophobic basement for the three zinc-binding histidines in the consensus sequence."
17475673	Underexpression of the Na+-dependent neutral amino acid transporter ASCT2 in the spontaneously hypertensive rat kidney.	This study examined the inward transport of l-[(14)C]alanine, an ASCT2 preferential substrate, in monolayers of immortalized renal proximal tubular epithelial (PTE) cells from Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats. The expression of ASCT2 in WKY and SHR PTE cells and kidney cortices from WKY and SHR was also evaluated. l-[(14)C]alanine uptake was highly dependent on extracellular Na(+). Replacement of NaCl by LiCl or choline chloride abolished transport activity in SHR and WKY PTE cells. In the presence of the system L inhibitor BCH, Na(+)-dependent l-alanine uptake in WKY and SHR PTE cells was inhibited by alanine, serine, and cysteine, which is consistent with amino acid transport through ASCT2. The saturable component of Na(+)-dependent l-alanine transport under V(max) conditions in SHR PTE cells was one-half of that in WKY PTE cells, with similar K(m) values. Differences in magnitude of Na(+)-dependent l-alanine uptake through ASCT2 between WKY and SHR PTE cells correlated positively with differences in ASCT2 protein expression, this being more abundant in WKY PTE cells. Abundance of ASCT2 transcript and protein in kidney cortices of SHR rats was also lower than that in normotensive WKY rats. In conclusion, immortalized SHR and WKY PTE cells take up l-alanine mainly through a high-affinity Na(+)-dependent amino acid transporter, with functional features of ASCT2 transport. The activity and expression of the ASCT2 transporter were considerably lower in the SHR cells.
12504781	In vitro effect of sanguinarine alkaloid on binding of [3H]candesartan to the human angiotensin AT1 receptor.	The type of interaction of 5-methyl-2,3,7,8-bis(methylenedioxy)benzo[c]phenanthridinium (sanguinarine), an alkaloid isolated from the root of Bocconia frutescens L., with the human angiotensin AT(1) receptor was evaluated in both intact cells and membrane binding of [3H](2-ethoxy-1-[(2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl)methyl]-1H-benzimidazoline-7 -carboxylic acid) ([3H]candesartan). The results indicate that the inhibition of [3H]candesartan binding by sanguinarine is independent of cell viability, since the alkaloid inhibited at a similar extent radioligand binding on both intact Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with the human angiotensin AT(1) receptor (hAT(1)) and their cell membranes (K(i)=0.14 and 1.10 microM, respectively). The unsuccessful recovery of [3H]candesartan binding after washing sanguinarine off the cells suggested a nearly irreversible or slow reversible interaction. Saturation binding studies showed a substantial reduction of the B(max) without affecting the K(d). In addition, the presence of 2-n-butyl-4chloro-5-hydroxymethyl-1-[(2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl)methyl]i midazole (losartan) could not prevent sanguinarine inhibition of [3H]candesartan binding neither. The present findings indicate that sanguinarine interacts with the receptor in a slow, nearly irreversible and noncompetitive manner.
23583259	Agonism of human pregnane X receptor by rilpivirine and etravirine: Comparison with first generation non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.	Rilpivirine and etravirine are second generation non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors approved recently by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection. Pregnane X receptor (PXR) is a member of the superfamily of nuclear receptors that regulate the expression of various genes controlling diverse biological functions. The present study investigated the effects of rilpivirine and etravirine on the activity of human PXR (hPXR), including the mode of activation, and compared them to those of efavirenz, nevirapine, and delavirdine, which are first generation non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. In transiently transfected HepG2 cells, rilpivirine, etravirine, and efavirenz, but not nevirapine or delavirdine, activated human, mouse, and rat PXR. Results from mechanistic studies indicated that rilpivirine, etravirine, and efavirenz, but not nevirapine or delavirdine, bound to the ligand-binding domain of hPXR, as assessed by a transactivation assay and by a competitive ligand-binding assay using time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer; triggered nuclear translocation of a green fluorescence protein-tagged hPXR, as visualized by confocal imaging; and recruited steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1), SRC-2, and SRC-3 to hPXR, as demonstrated by mammalian two-hybrid assays. Rilpivirine, etravirine, and efavirenz, but not nevirapine or delavirdine, increased hPXR target gene (CYP3A4) expression in primary cultures of human hepatocytes. In summary, select non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors activated human and rodent PXR. Rilpivirine, etravirine, and efavirenz, but not nevirapine or delavirdine, were identified as agonists of hPXR, as assessed in mechanistic experiments, and inducers of CYP3A4, as determined in primary cultures of human hepatocytes.
23234271	Design and synthesis of diazatricyclodecane agonists of the G-protein-coupled receptor 119.	"A series of GPR119 agonists based on a 2,6-diazatricyclo[3.3.1.1∼3,7∼]decane ring system is described. Also provided is a detailed account of the development of a multigram scale synthesis of the diazatricyclic ring system, which was achieved using a Hofmann-Löffler-Freytag reaction as the key step. The basis for the use of this complex framework lies in an attempt to constrain one end of the molecule in the ""agonist conformation"" as was previously described for 3-oxa-7-aza-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonanes. Optimization of carbamate analogues of the diazatricylic compounds led to the identification of 32i as a potent agonist of the GPR119 receptor with low unbound human liver microsomal clearance. The use of an agonist response weighted ligand lipophilic efficiency (LLE) termed AgLLE is discussed along with the issues of applying efficiency measures to agonist programs. Ultimately, solubility limited absorption and poor exposure reduced further interest in these molecules."
8469910	Inhibitors of the arachidonic acid metabolism attenuate the thyroliberin (TRH) stimulated prolactin production without modifying the production of inositolphosphates in GH4C1 pituitary cells.	Some arachidonic acid metabolites might be among the intracellular signalling substances that regulate hormone release. We report that the phospholipase A2 and diacylglycerol lipase inhibitor quinacrine (1-10 mumol l-1) inhibited the thyroliberin stimulated prolactin (rPRL) production in a dose-dependent way in a rat pituitary tumour cell line (GH4Cl cells). The lipoxygenase inhibitor nafazatrom (5-50 mumol-1) also dose-dependently inhibited the thyroliberin stimulated rPRL production, while the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor indomethacin had no such effect on rPRL production. The inhibitors of the arachidonic acid metabolism (quinacrine, ETYA and nafazatrom) had no effect on the accumulation of inositolpolyphosphates indicating that the arachidonic acid metabolites are not involved in the regulation of the phospholipase C activity.
10411647	Tyrosine hydroxylase binds tetrahydrobiopterin cofactor with negative cooperativity, as shown by kinetic analyses and surface plasmon resonance detection.	Kinetic studies of tetrameric recombinant human tyrosine hydroxylase isoform 1 (hTH1) have revealed properties so far not reported for this enzyme. Firstly, with the natural cofactor (6R)-Lerythro-5,6,7, 8-tetrahydrobiopterin (H4biopterin) a time-dependent change (burst) in enzyme activity was observed, with a half-time of about 20 s for the kinetic transient. Secondly, nonhyperbolic saturation behaviour was found for H4biopterin with a pronounced negative cooperativity (0.39 < h < 0.58; [S]0.5 = 24 +/- 4 microM). On phosphorylation of Ser40 by protein kinase A, the affinity for H4biopterin increased ([S]0.5 = 11 +/- 2 microM) and the negative cooperativity was amplified (h = 0.27 +/- 0.03). The dimeric C-terminal deletion mutant (Delta473-528) of hTH1 also showed negative cooperativity of H4biopterin binding (h = 0.4). Cooperativity was not observed with the cofactor analogues 6-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin (h = 0.9 +/- 0.1; Km = 62.7 +/- 5.7 microM) and 3-methyl-5,6,7, 8-tetrahydropterin (H43-methyl-pterin)(h = 1.0 +/- 0.1; Km = 687 +/- 50 microM). In the presence of 1 mM H43-methyl-pterin, used as a competitive cofactor analogue to BH4, hyperbolic saturation curves were also found for H4biopterin (h = 1.0), thus confirming the genuine nature of the kinetic negative cooperativity. This cooperativity was confirmed by real-time biospecific interaction analysis by surface plasmon resonance detection. The equilibrium binding of H4biopterin to the immobilized iron-free apoenzyme results in a saturable positive resonance unit (DeltaRU) response with negative cooperativity (h = 0.52-0.56). Infrared spectroscopic studies revealed a reduced thermal stability both of the apo-and the holo-hTH1 on binding of H4biopterin and Lerythro-dihydrobiopterin (H2biopterin). Moreover, the ligand-bound forms of the enzyme also showed a decreased resistance to limited tryptic proteolysis. These findings indicate that the binding of H4biopterin at the active site induces a destabilizing conformational change in the enzyme which could be related to the observed negative cooperativity. Thus, our studies provide new insight into the regulation of TH by the concentration of H4biopterin which may have significant implications for the physiological regulation of catecholamine biosynthesis in neuroendocrine cells.
23149657	Short duration of diabetes and disuse of sulfonylurea have any association with insulin cessation of the patients with type 2 diabetes in a clinical setting in Japan (JDDM 30).	Insulin therapy is often required to achieve good glycemic control for the patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), while protraction of glycemic control without insulin therapy may be preferable for patients. To determine the characteristics of and therapeutic regimen in outpatients with T2DM who were able to stop insulin therapy with satisfactory glycemic control in a real clinical practice setting in Japan by a case-control study. The present study was performed on 928 patients with T2DM who started insulin therapy in 2007. Data regarding age, sex, body mass index, duration of diabetes, HbA1c, postprandial plasma glucose, plasma fasting C-peptide immunoreactivity and treatment modality were compared between patients who were able to stop insulin therapy and those who continued with insulin. Of the 928 patients, 37 had stopped insulin therapy within 1 year. In the patients who stopped insulin therapy, the duration of diabetes was significantly shorter and the daily insulin dosage at initiation and the prevalence of sulfonylurea pretreatment significantly lower compared with patients who continued on insulin. In conclusion, almost 4% of T2DM patients were able to stop insulin therapy with satisfactory glycemic control in a real clinical practice setting in Japan. Shorter duration of diabetes and disuse of sulfonylureas prior to insulin may associate with stopping insulin therapy as a near-normoglycemic remission in outpatients with T2DM in Japan.
23214926	Total synthesis of AMF-26, an antitumor agent for inhibition of the Golgi system, targeting ADP-ribosylation factor 1.	An effective method for the total synthesis of 1 (AMF-26), a potentially promising new anticancer drug that disrupts the Golgi system by inhibiting the ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1) activation, has been developed for the first time. The construction of the chiral linear precursor (a key to the synthesis) was achieved by the asymmetric aldol reaction followed by the computer-assisted predictive stereoselective intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction. The global antitumor activity of the totally synthetic 1 against a variety of human cancer cells was assessed using a panel of 39 human cancer cell lines (JFCR39), and it was shown that the synthetic 1 strongly inhibited the growth of several cancer cell lines at concentrations of less than 0.04 μM. Biological assays of novel derivatives, 26 and 31, which have different side-chains at the C-4 positions in the Δ¹,²-octalin backbone, disclosed the importance of the suitable structure of the side-chain containing conjugated multidouble bonds.
23537574	Amino acids as co-amorphous stabilizers for poorly water soluble drugs - Part 1: Preparation, stability and dissolution enhancement.	Poor aqueous solubility of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) is one of the most pressing problems in pharmaceutical research and development because up to 90% of new API candidates under development are poorly water soluble. These drugs usually have a low and variable oral bioavailability, and therefore an unsatisfactory therapeutic effect. One of the most promising approaches to increase dissolution rate and solubility of these drugs is the conversion of a crystalline form of the drug into its respective amorphous form, usually by incorporation into hydrophilic polymers, forming glass solutions. However, this strategy only led to a small number of marketed products usually because of inadequate physical stability of the drug (crystallization). In this study, we investigated a fundamentally different approach to stabilize the amorphous form of drugs, namely the use of amino acids as small molecular weight excipients that form specific molecular interactions with the drug resulting in co-amorphous forms. The two poorly water soluble drugs carbamazepine and indomethacin were combined with amino acids from the binding sites of the biological receptors of these drugs. Mixtures of drug and the amino acids arginine, phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine were prepared by vibrational ball milling. Solid-state characterization with X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) revealed that the various blends could be prepared as homogeneous, single phase co-amorphous formulations indicated by the appearance of an amorphous halo in the XRPD diffractograms and a single glass transition temperature (Tg) in the DSC measurements. In addition, the Tgs of the co-amorphous mixtures were significantly increased over those of the individual drugs. The drugs remained chemically stable during the milling process and the co-amorphous formulations were generally physically stable over at least 6months at 40°C under dry conditions. The dissolution rate of all co-amorphous drug-amino acid mixtures was significantly increased over that of the respective crystalline and amorphous pure drugs. Amino acids thus appear as promising excipients to solve challenges connected with the stability and dissolution of amorphous drugs.
23252711	Comparative structural and functional studies of 4-(thiazol-5-yl)-2-(phenylamino)pyrimidine-5-carbonitrile CDK9 inhibitors suggest the basis for isotype selectivity.	Cyclin-dependent kinase 9/cyclin T, the protein kinase heterodimer that constitutes positive transcription elongation factor b, is a well-validated target for treatment of several diseases, including cancer and cardiac hypertrophy. In order to aid inhibitor design and rationalize the basis for CDK9 selectivity, we have studied the CDK-binding properties of six different members of a 4-(thiazol-5-yl)-2-(phenylamino)pyrimidine-5-carbonitrile series that bind to both CDK9/cyclin T and CDK2/cyclin A. We find that for a given CDK, the melting temperature of a CDK/cyclin/inhibitor complex correlates well with inhibitor potency, suggesting that differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) is a useful orthogonal measure of inhibitory activity for this series. We have used DSF to demonstrate that the binding of these compounds is independent of the presence or absence of the C-terminal tail region of CDK9, unlike the binding of the CDK9-selective inhibitor 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazone-1-β-d-ribofuranoside (DRB). Finally, on the basis of 11 cocrystal structures bound to CDK9/cyclin T or CDK2/cyclin A, we conclude that selective inhibition of CDK9/cyclin T by members of the 4-(thiazol-5-yl)-2-(phenylamino)pyrimidine-5-carbonitrile series results from the relative malleability of the CDK9 active site rather than from the formation of specific polar contacts.
16199241	Duloxetine hydrochloride: a new dual-acting medication for the treatment of major depressive disorder.	BACKGROUND: Duloxetine hydrochloride has recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Duloxetine is a potent inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, with weak effects on dopamine reuptake. OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the literature on duloxetine with regard to its pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and tolerability. METHODS: A comprehensive search of MEDLINE was performed using the terms duloxetine, Cymbalta, and major depressive disorder, with no restriction on year. The Eli Lilly and Company clinical trial registry, and abstracts and posters from recent American Psychiatric Association meetings were also reviewed. RESULTS: Duloxetine exhibits linear, dose-dependent pharmacokinetics across the approved oral dosage range of 40 to 60 mg/d. No dose adjustment appears to be needed based on age. Duloxetine has shown efficacy in reducing depressive symptoms compared with placebo, and duloxetine recipients have shown significant improvements in global functioning compared with placebo (both, P < 0.05). Response and remission rates have been comparable to or greater than those seen with fluoxetine or paroxetine. Duloxetine is generally well tolerated, with nausea, dry mouth, and fatigue being the most common treatment-emergent adverse effects. Cardiovascular adverse effects do not appear to result in sustained blood pressure elevations, QTc-interval prolongation, or other electrocardiographic changes. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the available evidence, duloxetine is a well-tolerated and effective treatment for MDD in adults. Randomized head-to-head comparisons against established antidepressants are needed to determine the relative safety and efficacy of duloxetine.
11401111	Plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and adrenomedullin: prognostic utility and prediction of benefit from carvedilol in chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction. Australia-New Zealand Heart Failure Group.	OBJECTIVES: We sought to assess plasma concentrations of the amino (N)-terminal portion of pro-brain natriuretic peptide (N-BNP) and adrenomedullin for prediction of adverse outcomes and responses to treatment in 297 patients with ischemic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction who were randomly assigned to receive carvedilol or placebo. BACKGROUND: Although neurohormonal status has known prognostic significance in heart failure, the predictive power of either N-BNP or adrenomedullin in chronic ischemic LV dysfunction has not been previously reported. METHODS: Plasma N-BNP and adrenomedullin were measured in 297 patients with chronic ischemic (LV) dysfunction before randomization to carvedilol or placebo, added to established treatment with a converting enzyme inhibitor and loop diuretic (with or without digoxin). The patients' clinical outcomes, induding mortality and heart failure events, were recorded for 18 months. RESULTS: Above-median N-BNP and adrenomedullin levels conferred increased risks (all p < 0.001) of mortality (risk ratios [95% confidence intervals]: 4.67 [2-10.9] and 3.92 [1.76-8.7], respectively) and hospital admission with heart failure (4.7 [2.2-10.3] and 2.4 [1.3-4.5], respectively). Both of these predicted death or heart failure independent of age, New York Heart Association functional class, LV ejection fraction, previous myocardial infarction or previous admission with heart failure. Carvedilol reduced the risk of death or heart failure in patients with above-median levels of N-BNP or adrenomedullin, or both, to rates not significantly different from those observed in patients with levels below the median value. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with established ischemic LV dysfunction, plasma N-BNP and adrenomedullin are independent predictors of mortality and heart failure. Carvedilol reduced mortality and heart failure in patients with higher pre-treatment plasma N-BNP and adrenomedullin.
23402744	Sexually dimorphic behavior after developmental exposure to characterize endocrine-mediated effects of different non-dioxin-like PCBs in rats.	Many chemicals are known to exhibit endocrine activity and affect reproductive functions in vertebrates and invertebrates. Endocrine effects include influences on sexual differentiation of the brain during development and reproductive and non-reproductive behavior in adult offspring. We previously demonstrated that developmental exposure to a mixture of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) which was reconstituted according to the congener pattern found in human breast milk caused feminization of sweet preference as a sexually dimorphic behavior in adult male rats, following decreases in aromatase activity in the brain of newborn male pups. This result may be due to dioxin-like or non-dioxin-like (NDL) PCBs and their respective effects on steroid hormones. The aim of the present experiments was to determine if exposure to highly purified NDL-PCBs (to remove Ah receptor active contaminants) also results in alteration of sweet preference. Pregnant rats were orally exposed to PCB52 (6 dose groups, total dose of 0-3000mg/kg body weight) or PCB180 (6 dose groups, total dose of 0-1000mg/kg body weight). In a further experiment rat dams were treated with equimolar doses of PCB74 or PCB95 (total dose, 760μmol/kg body weight, corresponding to 229mg/kg or 248mg/kg body weight of PCB74 and PCB95, respectively). Adult male and female offspring were given a choice between a bottle of saccharin solution (0.25%) and a bottle of tap water on five consecutive days. Control females consumed approximately twice as much sweetened solution compared with control males, thus, demonstrating sexual dimorphism of this behavior. Only non-significant reduction of sweet preference was found at the top dose level in female offspring after exposure to PCB52. Female offspring exposed to PCB180 exhibited signs of supernormal behavior as illustrated by increased saccharin consumption at intermediate dose levels. Decreased sweet preference was observed in females after developmental PCB74, whereas males were unaffected. Only PCB95 increased saccharin consumption in exposed males, leading to decreased sexual dimorphism of this behavior and behavioral feminization. The results demonstrate that different NDL-PCBs exhibit differential effects on sexually dimorphic behavior and that feminization occurs after removal of Ah receptor active contaminants. Comparison with data from the literature reveals little evidence for a relation to anti-androgenic activity of the studied NDL-PCBs.
1318989	Further characterization of alpha N-acetyl beta-endorphin-(1-31) regulatory activity, I: Effect on opioid- and alpha 2-mediated supraspinal antinociception in mice.	Picomol doses of the acetylated derivative of beta-endorphin-(1-31), injected intracerebroventricularly (icv) in mice, reduced the analgesic activity of morphine, etorphine and beta-endorphin-(1-31), while the efficiency of DAGO and DADLE in producing analgesia was enhanced. The effects of the delta agonists DPDPE and [D-Ala2]-Deltorphin II were not altered by this treatment. After alpha N-acetyl beta-endorphin-(1-31) injection, morphine antagonized the analgesia of DAGO. The regulatory effect of alpha N-acetyl beta-endorphin-(1-31) was exhibited when giving the peptide both before (up to 24 h) and after the opioids. Naloxone did not prevent or reverse that modulatory activity; moreover, pretreatment with the acetylated peptide did not change the pA2 value displayed by the antagonist at the mu receptor. The antinociceptive activity of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine was also increased in mice treated with alpha N-acetyl beta-endorphin-(1-31). The reducing activity of alpha N-acetyl beta-endorphin-(1-31) upon morphine- and beta-endorphin-induced analgesia was not exhibited in mice undergoing treatment with pertussis toxin or N-ethylmaleimide, agents known to impair the function of Gi/Go transducer proteins. However, the enhancing activity displayed by this peptide upon DAGO- DADLE and clonidine-evoked antinociception was still manifested. These results confirm and strengthen the idea of alpha N-acetyl beta-endorphin-(1-31) acting as a non-competitive regulator of mu opioid- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated supraspinal antinociception. A neural substrate acted on by both receptors (likely Gi/Go transducer proteins) appears to be involved in the effects of that neuropeptide.
22935038	Postpartum corticosterone administration reduces dendritic complexity and increases the density of mushroom spines of hippocampal CA3 arbours in dams.	Postpartum depression (PPD) affects approximately 15% of mothers after giving birth. A complete understanding of depression during the postpartum period has yet to be established, although disruptions in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and stress during the postpartum may be involved. To model these components in rats, we administered high corticosterone (CORT) postpartum, which increases immobility in the forced swim test (FST), and reduces maternal care, body weight and hippocampal cell proliferation in dams. The hippocampus is altered in response to chronic stress, exposure to high glucocorticoids and in major depression in humans. In the present study, we examined whether high CORT reduced dendritic complexity and spines in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. Additionally, housing complexity was manipulated so that dams and litters were housed either with tubes (complex) or without tubes (impoverished) to investigate the consequences of new animal care regulations. Dams received 40 mg/kg/day of CORT or oil starting on day 2 postpartum for 23 days. Maternal behaviours were assessed on postpartum days 2-8 and dams were tested using the FST on days 21 and 22. Dams were killed on day 24 and brains were processed for Golgi impregnation. Pyramidal cells in the CA3 subfield were traced using a camera lucida and analysed for branch points and dendritic complexity, as well as spine density and type on both basal and apical arbours. As previously established, high CORT postpartum reduced maternal care and increased immobility in the FST, which is a measure of depressive-like behaviour. High CORT postpartum reduced the complexity of basal arbours and increased mushroom spines on both apical and basal dendrites. Housing complexity had no effect on spines of CA3 pyramidal cells but modest effects on cell morphology. These data show that chronic high CORT in postpartum females alters hippocampal morphology and may provide insight regarding the neurobiological consequences of high stress or CORT during the postpartum period, as well as be relevant for postpartum stress or depression.
16396637	Hepatic very-low-density lipoprotein and apolipoprotein B production are increased following in vivo induction of betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase.	We have previously reported a positive correlation between the expression of BHMT (betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase) and ApoB (apolipoprotein B) in rat hepatoma McA (McArdle RH-7777) cells [Sowden, Collins, Smith, Garrow, Sparks and Sparks (1999) Biochem. J. 341, 639-645]. To examine whether a similar relationship occurs in vivo, hepatic BHMT expression was induced by feeding rats a Met (L-methionine)-restricted betaine-containing diet, and parameters of ApoB metabolism were evaluated. There were no generalized metabolic abnormalities associated with Met restriction for 7 days, as evidenced by control levels of serum glucose, ketones, alanine aminotransferase and L-homocysteine levels. Betaine plus the Met restriction resulted in lower serum insulin and non-esterified fatty acid levels. Betaine plus Met restriction induced hepatic BHMT 4-fold and ApoB mRNA 3-fold compared with Met restriction alone. No changes in percentage of edited ApoB mRNA were observed on the test diets. An increase in liver ApoB mRNA correlated with an 82% and 46% increase in ApoB and triacylglycerol production respectively using in vivo Triton WR 1339. Increased secretion of VLDL (very-low-density lipoprotein) with Met restriction plus betaine was associated with a 45% reduction in liver triacylglycerol compared with control. Nuclear run-off assays established that transcription of both bhmt and apob genes was also increased in Met-restricted plus betaine diets. No change in ApoB mRNA stability was detected in BHMT-transfected McA cells. Hepatic ApoB and BHMT mRNA levels were also increased by 1.8- and 3-fold respectively by betaine supplementation of Met-replete diets. Since dietary betaine increased ApoB mRNA, VLDL ApoB and triacylglycerol production and decreased hepatic triacylglycerol, results suggest that induction of apob transcription may provide a potential mechanism for mobilizing hepatic triacylglycerol by increasing ApoB available for VLDL assembly and secretion.
23100159	Enhanced carcinogenicity by coexposure to arsenic and iron and a novel remediation system for the elements in well drinking water.	Various carcinomas including skin cancer are explosively increasing in arsenicosis patients who drink arsenic-polluted well water, especially in Bangladesh. Although well drinking water in the cancer-prone areas contains various elements, very little is known about the effects of elements except arsenic on carcinogenicity. In order to clarify the carcinogenic effects of coexposure to arsenic and iron, anchorage-independent growth and invasion in human untransformed HaCaT and transformed A431 keratinocytes were examined. Since the mean ratio of arsenic and iron in well water was 1:10 in cancer-prone areas of Bangladesh, effects of 1 μM arsenic and 10 μM iron were investigated. Iron synergistically promoted arsenic-mediated anchorage-independent growth in untransformed and transformed keratinocytes. Iron additionally increased invasion in both types of keratinocytes. Activities of c-SRC and ERK that regulate anchorage-independent growth and invasion were synergistically enhanced in both types of keratinocytes. Our results suggest that iron promotes arsenic-mediated transformation of untransformed keratinocytes and progression of transformed keratinocytes. We then developed a low-cost and high-performance adsorbent composed of a hydrotalcite-like compound for arsenic and iron. The adsorbent rapidly reduced concentrations of both elements from well drinking water in cancer-prone areas of Bangladesh to levels less than those in WHO health-based guidelines for drinking water. Thus, we not only demonstrated for the first time increased carcinogenicity by coexposure to arsenic and iron but also proposed a novel remediation system for well drinking water.
16982784	Role of Asp104 in the SHV beta-lactamase.	Among the TEM-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), an amino acid change at Ambler position 104 (Glu to Lys) results in increased resistance to ceftazidime and cefotaxime when found with other substitutions (e.g., Gly238Ser and Arg164Ser). To examine the role of Asp104 in SHV beta-lactamases, site saturation mutagenesis was performed. Our goal was to investigate the properties of amino acid residues at this position that affect resistance to penicillins and oxyimino-cephalosporins. Unexpectedly, 58% of amino acid variants at position 104 in SHV expressed in Escherichia coli DH10B resulted in beta-lactamases with lowered resistance to ampicillin. In contrast, increased resistance to cefotaxime was demonstrated only for the Asp104Arg and Asp104Lys beta-lactamases. When all 19 substitutions were introduced into the SHV-2 (Gly238Ser) ESBL, the most significant increases in cefotaxime and ceftazidime resistance were noted for both the doubly substituted Asp104Lys Gly238Ser and the doubly substituted Asp104Arg Gly238Ser beta-lactamases. Correspondingly, the overall catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of hydrolysis for cefotaxime was increased from 0.60 +/- 0.07 microM(-1) s(-1) (mean +/- standard deviation) for Gly238Ser to 1.70 +/- 0.01 microM(-1) s(-1) for the Asp104Lys and Gly238Ser beta-lactamase (threefold increase). We also showed that (i) k3 was the rate-limiting step for the hydrolysis of cefotaxime by Asp104Lys, (ii) the Km for cefotaxime of the doubly substituted Asp104Lys Gly238Ser variant approached that of the Gly238Ser beta-lactamase as pH increased, and (iii) Lys at position 104 functions in an energetically additive manner with the Gly238Ser substitution to enhance catalysis of cephalothin. Based on this analysis, we propose that the amino acid at Ambler position 104 in SHV-1 beta-lactamase plays a major role in substrate binding and recognition of oxyimino-cephalosporins and influences the interactions of Tyr105 with penicillins.
23022324	Inhibition of neurite outgrowth and alteration of cytoskeletal gene expression by sodium arsenite.	Arsenic compounds that are often found in drinking water increase the risk of developmental brain disorders. In this study, we performed live imaging analyses of Neuro-2a cells expressing SCAT3, a caspase-3 cleavage peptide sequence linking two fluorescent proteins; enhanced cyan fluorescence protein (ECFP) and Venus, to determine whether sodium arsenite (NaAsO(2); 0, 1, 5, or 10 μM) affects both neurite outgrowth and/or induces apoptosis with the same doses and in the same cell cultures. We observed that the area ratio of neurite to cell body in SCAT3-expressing cells was significantly reduced by 5 and 10 μM NaAsO(2), but not by 1 μM, although the emission ratio of ECFP to Venus, an endpoint of caspase-3 activity, was not changed. However, cytological assay using apoptotic and necrotic markers resulted in that apoptosis, but not necrosis, was significantly induced in Neuro-2a cells when NaAsO(2) exposure continued after the significant effects of NaAsO(2) on neurite outgrowth were found by live imaging. These results suggested that neurite outgrowth was suppressed by NaAsO(2) prior to NaAsO(2)-induced apoptosis. Next, we examined the effects of NaAsO(2) on cytoskeletal gene expression in Neuro-2a cells. NaAsO(2) increased the mRNA levels of the light and medium subunits of neurofilament and decreased the mRNA levels of tau and tubulin in a dose-dependent manner; no significant effect was found in the mRNA levels of the heavy subunit of neurofilament, microtubule-associated protein 2, or actin. The changes in cytoskeletal gene expression are likely responsible for the inhibitory effects of NaAsO(2) on neurite outgrowth.
8032658	Further characterization of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors (putative 5-HT2B) in rat stomach fundus longitudinal muscle.	1. The present study was undertaken to isolate and characterize pharmacologically homogeneous populations of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors from a possible mixed receptor population mediating concentration of the longitudinal muscle of rat stomach fundus. Our aim was to extend the pharmacological characterization of the 5-HT2B receptor which is reported to be expressed in this preparation. 2. To minimize spontaneous activity and any influence of circular muscle on the contractile response, narrow (1-1.5 x 20 mm) segments of mucosa-denuded longitudinal muscle were used. Under these conditions, blockade of monoamine oxidase with pargyline (100 microM for 15 min) caused a leftward displacement of concentration-effect curves for both 5-methoxytryptamine (5-MeO-T) and tryptamine. Neither pargyline nor a number of uptake inhibitors affected responses to 5-HT. 3. In pargyline pretreated preparations, the order of potency of a number of tryptamine analogues was as follows: 5-MeO-T > or = alpha-Me-5-HT > or = 5-HT > 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) > tryptamine > 2-Me-5-HT. In addition several ligands known to act as agonists at either 5-HT2A or 5-HT2C receptors including 1-m-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP), Ru 24969, MK 212 and SCH 23390 were also agonists in rat fundus whilst sumatriptan, renzapride and 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) were very weak or inactive. With the exception of 2-Me-5-HT and m-CPP, most agonists produced monophasic concentration-effect curves consistent with an interaction at a single site. High concentrations of 2-Me-5-HT evoked relaxations which were blocked by phentolamine (1 MicroM) suggesting an interaction with alpha-adrenoceptors. m-CPP often evoked biphasic concentration-effect curves with a second contractile phase which was insensitive to yohimbine at concentrations higher than required for antagonism of responses to 5-HT.4. LY 53857, methiothepin, methysergide, ritanserin and ICI 170809 were potent but non-surmountable antagonists of 5-HT in rat fundus. In contrast, several ligands behaved as surmountable antagonists with the following order of potency: rauwolscine >yohimbine = mesulergine > mianserin = SB 204070 >WY 26703 > SB 200646> pirenpirone> renzapride. DAU 6285, granisetron, spiperone, ketanserin,phentolamine and GR 127935 did not affect responses to 5-HT at concentrations up to 1 pM. The agonist and concentration independent profile of antagonism supported a single site interaction for both agonists and antagonists.5. We conclude that despite small differences concerning the enantiomeric selectivity and affinity of rauwolscine and yohimbine, the close pharmacological identity of 5-HT receptors in rat stomach fundus and the recently cloned 5-HT2B receptor is maintained. SB 200646, which demonstrates some selectivity for 5-HT receptors in rat stomach fundus, should provide a useful ligand for confirmation of this view and allow discrimination of 5-HT2B function both in vitro and in vivo.
10805052	Comparison of the AT1-receptor blocker, candesartan cilexetil, and the ACE inhibitor, lisinopril, in fixed combination with low dose hydrochlorothiazide in hypertensive patients.	AIM: To compare candesartan cilexetil and lisinopril in fixed combination with hydrochlorothiazide with respect to antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability. METHODS: This was a double-blind (double-dummy), randomised, parallel group comparison in patients with a mean sitting diastolic blood pressure 95-115 mm Hg on prior antihypertensive monotherapy. Treatments were candesartan cilexetil/hydrochlorothiazide 8/12.5 mg once daily (n = 237) and lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide 10/12.5 mg once daily (n = 116) for 26 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was change in trough sitting diastolic blood pressure. RESULTS: Changes in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure did not differ significantly between the groups (mean difference 0.5 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval -1.6, 2.7, P = 0.20). No significant differences between the groups was found for other haemodynamic variables (sitting systolic blood pressure, standing blood pressure, sitting/erect heart rate, and proportion of responders and controlled patients). Both drugs were well tolerated but the proportion of patients with at least one adverse event was significantly greater in the lisinopril group (80% vs 69%, P = 0.020). The proportion of patients spontaneously reporting cough (23.1% vs 4.6%) and discontinuing therapy due to adverse events (12.0% vs 5.9%) was also higher in the lisinopril group compared with the candesartan cilexetil group. CONCLUSIONS: The fixed combinations of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide 8/12.5 mg and lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide 10/12.5 mg once daily are equally effective as antihypertensive agents. The fixed combination containing candesartan cilexetil is better tolerated than that containing lisinopril.
23474645	Inverted CdSe/CdS/ZnS quantum dot light emitting devices with titanium dioxide as an electron-injection contact.	We demonstrated the fabrication of inverted CdSe/CdS/ZnS quantum dot light emitting devices (QD-LEDs) using titanium dioxide (TiO2) as an electron-injection layer and investigated the operating mechanism by utilizing different hole-transport materials, 4,4-N,N-dicarbazole-biphenyl (CBP) and 4,4',4''-tris(carbazol-9-yl)-triphenylamine (TCTA). A more efficient device with CBP as the hole-transport layer (HTL) was obtained compared with the TCTA based device. The peak efficiency of 6.70 cd A(-1) for the CBP based device was found to be about 74.5% higher than the TCTA based device (3.84 cd A(-1)). The studies on the time-resolved photoluminescence spectra of the QD-HTL composite structures showed that the energy transfer (ET) efficiencies from the two HTLs to the QD layer were similar and the charge separation between QDs and HTLs could be neglected. The enhancement in the performance of the CBP based device was attributed to the more efficient hole-injection from CBP to QDs.
23245513	A dimeric form of N-methoxycarbonyl-2-amino-1,8-naphthyridine bound to the A-A mismatch in the CAG/CAG base triad in dsRNA.	A dimeric form of N-methoxycarbonyl-2-amino-1,8-naphthyridine (MCND) connected at the C2 position with a three-atom linker was examined for the binding to mismatches in double stranded RNA. Despite the fully complementary hydrogen bonding groups to guanine, MCND did not bind to guanine-guanine mismatch but did to adenine-adenine mismatch. The base pairs flanking the mismatch had weak effect on the binding, with showing the strongest binding to the A-A mismatch in the CAG/CAG sequence. The A-A mismatch in the GAC/GAC sequence was a poor substrate for the MCND binding. A monomeric derivative of MCND and another derivative lacking a methylcarbamate group showed negligilble binding to the A-A mismatch and the sequence selectivity. These results are important clues for the better molecular design of RNA binding small molecules.
11716850	The effects of mitiglinide (KAD-1229), a new anti-diabetic drug, on ATP-sensitive K+ channels and insulin secretion: comparison with the sulfonylureas and nateglinide.	Mitiglinide (KAD-1229), a new anti-diabetic drug, is thought to stimulate insulin secretion by closing the ATP-sensitive K+ (K(ATP)) channels in pancreatic beta-cells. However, its selectivity for the various K(ATP) channels is not known. In this study, we examined the effects of mitiglinide on various cloned K(ATP) channels (Kir6.2/SUR1, Kir6.2/SUR2A, and Kir6.2/SUR2B) reconstituted in COS-1 cells, and compared them to another meglitinide-related compound, nateglinide. Patch-clamp analysis using inside-out recording configuration showed that mitiglinide inhibits the Kir6.2/SUR1 channel currents in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 value, 100 nM) but does not significantly inhibit either Kir6.2/SUR2A or Kir6.2/SUR2B channel currents even at high doses (more than 10 microM). Nateglinide inhibits Kir6.2/SUR1 and Kir6.2/SUR2B channels at 100 nM, and inhibits Kir6.2/SUR2A channels at high concentrations (1 microM). Binding experiments on mitiglinide, nateglinide, and repaglinide to SUR1 expressed in COS-1 cells revealed that they inhibit the binding of [3H]glibenclamide to SUR1 (IC50 values: mitiglinide, 280 nM; nateglinide, 8 microM; repaglinide, 1.6 microM), suggesting that they all share a glibenclamide binding site. The insulin responses to glucose, mitiglinide, tolbutamide, and glibenclamide in MIN6 cells after chronic mitiglinide, nateglinide, or repaglinide treatment were comparable to those after chronic tolbutamide and glibenclamide treatment. These results indicate that, similar to the sulfonylureas, mitiglinide is highly specific to the Kir6.2/SUR1 complex, i.e., the pancreatic beta-cell K(ATP) channel, and suggest that mitiglinide may be a clinically useful anti-diabetic drug.
8863001	Trimipramine: a challenge to current concepts on antidepressives.	Although it is chemically a classical tricyclic antidepressant agent, trimipramine shows atypical pharmacological properties. Its well-documented antidepressant action cannot be explained by noradrenaline or serotonin reuptake inhibition or by a down-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors. Furthermore, its receptor affinity profile resembles more that of clozapine, a neuroleptic drug, than that of tricyclic antidepressants. Trimipramine does not reduce, but rather increases, rapid eye movement sleep. It stimulates nocturnal prolactin secretion and inhibits nocturnal cortisol secretion and may act at the level of the hypothalamus on corticotropin-releasing hormone secretion. Trimipramine is of particular value in depressed patients with insomnia, and it has been shown to be effective in the therapy of primary insomnia. As the pharmacological profile indicates, and an open clinical study has shown, trimipramine might also be active as an antipsychotic. The drug is both a tool for increasing our understanding of depression and a potential therapy for several psychiatric disorders.
15894928	Epithelioid gastrointestinal stromal tumor with PDGFRA activating mutation and immunoreactivity.	The authors report a unique case of an intra-abdominal, epithelioid mesenchymal tumor that had an activating mutation of PDGFRA and a strong PDGFRA immunoreactivity but lacked both c-kit mutation and c-kit protein (CD117) expression. IHC study showed that the tumor cells were diffusely and strongly positive for PDGFRA, vimentin, CD34, and Bcl-2 but completely negative for CD117 as well as for muscle, epithelial, endothelial, endocrine, mesothelial, neural, and melanocytic cell markers. Molecular study revealed a mutation at the juxtamembrane domain of exon 12 in PDGFRA gene with GTC to GAC transition at codon 561 (V561D), as shown in the previous mutational studies on gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). This case likely represents an example of GIST with PDGFRA activating mutation and PDGFRA immunoreactivity without CD117 positivity, which has not been documented in the literature. STI 571 (imatinib mesylate [Gleevec]) might be an effective therapy in this case, since Gleevec targets both PDGFRA and c-kit oncoproteins.
15066664	Block of human NaV1.5 sodium channels by novel alpha-hydroxyphenylamide analogues of phenytoin.	Voltage-gated sodium (Na) channels are a critical component of electrically excitable cells. Phenytoin (diphenylhydantoin, DPH) is an established sodium channel blocker and is a useful anticonvulsant and class 1b antiarrhythmic, and has been effectively used in the treatment of neuropathic pain. In this study, we have synthesized novel alpha-hydroxyphenylamide analogues of diphenylhydantoin and examined their ability to inhibit human Na(V)1.5 sodium channels expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO-K1) cells. Phenyl ring substitutions were examined including para-methyl, para-fluoro, para-chloro, ortho-chloro and meta-chloro. We have found that phenyl ring substitutions with electron withdrawing properties resulted in compounds with greater activity. In comparison to diphenylhydantoin, the novel chloro-substituted alpha-hydroxyphenylamide compounds produced as much as a 20-fold greater tonic and frequency-dependent blockade of Na(V)1.5 channels with an IC(50) value of 14.5 microM. In addition, the chloro-substitutions have position specific state dependent blocking properties. The ortho-, meta- and para-chloro substitutions have an 8-, 13- and 3-fold increased affinity for the inactivated state, respectively. Molecular modeling suggests that these differences in affinity are due to a direct interaction with the receptor. Comparing models of diphenylhydantoin to the novel alpha-hydroxyphenlyamide compound suggests that the increased activity may be due to an optimized phenyl ring position and increased molecular volume. This information may be useful in the development of more potent sodium channel blockers.
23267840	NMDA and AMPA receptor mediated excitotoxicity in cerebral cortex of streptozotocin induced diabetic rat: ameliorating effects of curcumin.	Functional activity of neurotransmitter receptor and their sensitivity to regulation are altered in DM. We evaluated the neuroprotective effect of curcumin in glutamate mediated excitotoxicity in cerebral cortex of streptozotocin induced diabetic rats. Gene expression studies in diabetic rats showed a down regulation of glutamate decarboxylase mRNA leading to accumulation of glutamate. Radioreceptor binding assays showed a significant increase in α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors density which was confirmed by immunohistochemical studies. Decreased glutathione peroxidases gene expression indicates enhanced oxidative stress in diabetic rats. This leads to decreased expression of glutamate aspartate transporter, which in turn reduces glutamate transport. All these events lead to excitotoxic neuronal death in the cerebral cortex, which was confirmed by the increased expression of caspase 3, caspase 8 and BCL2-associated X protein. Curcumin and insulin treatment reversed these altered parameters to near control. We establish, a novel therapeutic role of curcumin by reducing the glutamate mediated excitotoxicity in cerebral cortex of diabetes through modulating the altered neurochemical parameters.
15572277	Adenosine A1 receptors and the anticonvulsant potential of drugs effective in the model of 3-nitropropionic acid-induced seizures in mice.	The role of adenosine A1 receptors in the activity of drugs and substances protecting against seizures evoked by mitochondrial toxin, 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NPA) was studied in mice. Non-selective A1/A2 adenosine receptor antagonist, aminophylline and selective A1 adenosine receptor antagonist, 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX) diminished the anticonvulsive effects of diazepam, phenobarbital, valproate and gabapentin. In contrast, A1/A2 adenosine receptor antagonist, 8-(p-sulfophenyl)theophylline (8pSPT) not penetrating via blood-brain barrier was ineffective. Aminophylline and DPCPX but not 8pSPT also reversed the protective action of A1/A2 adenosine receptor agonist, 2-chloroadenosine (2-CADO) and selective A1 adenosine receptor agonist, R-N6-phenylisopropyloadenosine (R-PIA), against 3-NPA-evoked convulsions. Obtained results suggest that the central adenosine A1 receptor stimulation may play a role in the anticonvulsive potential of diazepam, phenobarbital, valproate and gabapentin in a novel model of 3-NPA-evoked seizures. Moreover, concomitant application of aminophylline with these drugs may reduce their clinical antiepileptic efficacy, especially among patients suffering from seizures related to the disturbances of mitochondrial respiratory chain.
23567956	Analysis of the antioxidant properties of differently substituted 2- and 3-indolyl carbohydrazides and related derivatives.	Herein, we report the antioxidant properties of some selected substituted 2-indolyl carbohydrazides (JL34, JL40, JL71, JL87, JL317, JL432, JL436), the substituted 3-indolyl carbohydrazide JL344, 3-(3-hydrazinylpropyl)-1H-indole (JL72) and 3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanehydrazide (JL418), throughout the assessment of their antioxidative potential using different antioxidant assays such as DPPH, lipid peroxidation in the APPH, or the DMSO method. We conclude that these compounds are convenient templates for the design of useful drugs in to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD), a pathology characterized by extensive oxidative stress and inflammation, thus essentially affected by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Most of them are potent hydroxyl radical scavengers and inhibit in vitro lipid peroxidation. Compounds JL40 and JL432 presenting higher lipoxygenase inhibitory activity among the tested derivatives, were found to present a promising anti-inflammatory in vivo result, as well as antioxidant and LOX inhibitory profile. These results in combination to their known AChE/BuChE inhibitory activities led us to propose these indolyl carbohydrazides as new multifunctional compounds against AD.
10443304	[Brugada syndrome].	In 1992 we described a new syndrome consisting of syncopal episodes and/or sudden death in patients with a structurally normal heart and a characteristic electrocardiogram displaying a pattern resembling right bundle branch block with an ST segment elevation in leads V1 to V3. In 1998 it was described that the disease is genetically determined with an autosomal dominant pattern of transmission. Three different mutations have been identified. All three mutations affect the structure and the function of the sodium channel SCN5A. Two mutations result in total loss of function of the sodium channel. The other mutation results in acceleration of the recovery of the sodium channel from inactivation. The disease causes 4 to 10 sudden deaths per 10,000 inhabitants per year in areas like Thailand and Laos. Up to 50% of the yearly sudden deaths in patients with a normal heart might be caused by this syndrome. The diagnosis is easily made by means of the electrocardiogram (ECG). The presence of concealed and intermittent forms, however, makes the diagnosis difficult in some patients. The ECG can be modulated by changes in autonomic balance and the administration of antiarrhythmic drugs. Beta-adrenergic stimulation normalises the ECG, while i.v. ajmaline, flecainide or procainamide accentuate the ST segment elevation and are capable of unmasking concealed and intermittent forms of the disease. The prognosis is poor for patients who do not receive an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. Antiarrhythmic drugs like amiodarone or beta-blockers do not prevent sudden death in symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals.
23219525	Influence of sildenafil and tadalafil on the enzyme- and transporter-inducing effects of bosentan and ambrisentan in LS180 cells.	The combinations of the endothelin-1 receptor antagonists bosentan or ambrisentan with the phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors sildenafil or tadalafil are current standard therapies of advanced pulmonary arterial hypertension. However, these drugs have a number of drug interactions. Changes of bosentan pharmacokinetics by sildenafil are attributed to reduced hepatic uptake as a consequence of inhibition of organic anion transporting polypeptides. We therefore tested in vitro the hypothesis that sildenafil and tadalafil reduce the enzyme- and transporter-inducing effects of bosentan or ambrisentan by preventing cellular access. Although intracellular concentrations of bosentan and ambrisentan (measured by high pressure liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass-spectrometry) after four days of incubation of LS180 cells were lower when sildenafil or tadalafil were present, quantification of mRNA expression in these cells by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed that bosentan and ambrisentan-mediated induction was stable or even increased in combination with sildenafil or tadalafil. For the drug transporter P-glycoprotein this was confirmed at the protein and functional level with highly significant correlations between P-gp mRNA, protein, and function. Moreover, using a reporter gene assay in LS180 cells, our study demonstrates for the first time that tadalafil is a potent, ambrisentan a weak, and sildenafil no activator of pregnane X receptor. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that although sildenafil and tadalafil indeed reduce intracellular concentrations of bosentan and ambrisentan in LS180 cells, they do not mitigate the inducing effects of these endothelin-1 receptor antagonists.
12783542	Incorporation of trifluoroisoleucine into proteins in vivo.	Two fluorinated derivatives of isoleucine: d,l-2-amino-3-trifluoromethyl pentanoic acid (3TFI, 2) and d,l-2-amino-5,5,5-trifluoro-3-methyl pentanoic acid (5TFI, 3) were prepared. 5TFI was incorporated into a model target protein, murine dihydrofolate reductase (mDHFR), in an isoleucine auxotrophic Escherichia coli host strain suspended in 5TFI-supplemented minimal medium depleted of isoleucine. Incorporation of 5TFI was confirmed by tryptic peptide analysis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) of the protein product. Amino acid analysis showed that more than 93% of the encoded isoleucine residues were replaced by 5TFI. Measurement of the rate of activation of 5TFI by the E. coli isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS) yielded a specificity constant (k(cat)/K(m)) 134-fold lower than that for isoleucine. 5TFI was successfully introduced into the cytokine murine interleukin-2 (mIL-2) at the encoded isoleucine positions. The concentration of fluorinated protein that elicits 50% of the maximal proliferative response is 3.87 ng/mL, about 30% higher than that of wild-type mIL-2 (EC(50) = 2.70 ng/mL). The maximal responses are equivalent for the fluorinated and wild-type cytokines, indicating that fluorinated proteins can fold into stable and functional structures. 3TFI yielded no evidence for in vivo incorporation into recombinant proteins, and no evidence for activation by IleRS in vitro.
23284082	Amide hydrolysis of a novel chemical series of microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 inhibitors induces kidney toxicity in the rat.	A novel microsomal prostaglandin E synthase 1 (mPGES-1) inhibitor induced kidney injury at exposures representing less than 4 times the anticipated efficacious exposure in man during a 7-day toxicity study in rats. The findings consisted mainly of tubular lesions and the presence of crystalline material and increases in plasma urea and creatinine. In vitro and in vivo metabolic profiling generated a working hypothesis that a bis-sulfonamide metabolite (determined M1) formed by amide hydrolysis caused this toxicity. To test this hypothesis, rats were subjected to a 7-day study and were administered the suspected metabolite and two low-potency mPGES-1 inhibitor analogs, where amide hydrolysis was undetectable in rat hepatocyte experiments. The results suggested that compounds with a reduced propensity to undergo amide hydrolysis, thus having less ability to form M1, reduced the risk of inducing kidney toxicity. Rats treated with M1 alone showed no histopathologic change in the kidney, which was likely related to underexposure to M1. To circumvent rat kidney toxicity, we identified a potent mPGES-1 inhibitor with a low propensity for amide hydrolysis and superior rat pharmacokinetic properties. A subsequent 14-day rat toxicity study showed that this compound was associated with kidney toxicity at 42, but not 21, times the anticipated efficacious exposure in humans. In conclusion, by including metabolic profiling and exploratory rat toxicity studies, a new and active mPGES-1 inhibitor with improved margins to chemically induced kidney toxicity in rats has been identified.
18559268	Optimization of taxane binding to microtubules: binding affinity dissection and incremental construction of a high-affinity analog of paclitaxel.	The microtubule binding affinities of a series of synthetic taxanes have been measured with the aims of dissecting individual group contributions and obtaining a rationale for the design of novel compounds with the ability to overcome drug resistance. As previously observed for epothilones, the positive and negative contributions of the different substituents to the binding free energies are cumulative. By combining the most favorable substitutions we increased the binding affinity of paclitaxel 500-fold. Insight into the structural basis for this improvement was gained with molecular modeling and NMR data obtained for microtubule-bound docetaxel. Taxanes with affinities for microtubules well above their affinities for P-glycoprotein are shown not to be affected by multidrug resistance. This finding strongly indicates that optimization of the ligand-target interaction is a good strategy to overcome multidrug resistance mediated by efflux pumps.
9808077	Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in affective disorders--I. Basic pharmacology.	The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine and sertraline, are the result of rational research to find drugs that were as effective as the tricyclic antidepressants but with fewer safety and tolerability problems. The SSRIs selectively and powerfully inhibit serotonin reuptake and result in a potentiation of serotonergic neurotransmission. The property of potent serotonin reuptake appears to give a broad spectrum of therapeutic activity in depression, anxiety, obsessional and impulse control disorders. However, despite the sharing of the same principal mechanism of action, SSRIs are structurally diverse with clear variations in their pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles. The potency for serotonin reuptake inhibition varies amongst this group, as does the selectivity for serotonin relative to noradrenaline and dopamine reuptake inhibition. The relative potency of sertraline for dopamine reuptake inhibition differentiates it pharmacologically from other SSRIs. Affinity for neuroreceptors, such as sigma1, muscarinic and 5-HT2c, also differs widely. Furthermore, the inhibition of nitric oxide synthetase by paroxetine, and possibly other SSRIs, may have significant pharmacodynamic effects. Citalopram and fluoxetine are racemic mixtures of different chiral forms that possess varying pharmacokinetic and pharmacological profiles. Fluoxetine has a long acting and pharmacologically active metabolite. There are important clinical differences among the SSRIs in their pharmacokinetic characteristics. These include differences in their half-lives, linear versus non-linear pharmacokinetics, effect of age on their clearance and their potential to inhibit drug metabolising cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes. These pharmacological and pharmacokinetic differences underly the increasingly apparent important clinical differences amongst the SSRIs.
23146871	Manganese transport via the transferrin mechanism.	Excessive manganese (Mn) uptake by brain cells, particularly in regions like the basal ganglia, can lead to toxicity. Mn(2+) is transported into cells via a number of mechanisms, while Mn(3+) is believed to be transported similarly to iron (Fe) via the transferrin (Tf) mechanism. Cellular Mn uptake is therefore determined by the activity of the mechanisms transporting Mn into each type of cell and by the amounts of Mn(2+), Mn(3+) and their complexes to which these cells are exposed; this complicates understanding the contributions of each transporter to Mn toxicity. While uptake of Fe(3+) via the Tf mechanism is well understood, uptake of Mn(3+) via this mechanism has not been systematically studied. The stability of the Mn(3+)Tf complex allowed us to form and purify this complex and label it with a fluorescent (Alexa green) tag. Using purified and labeled Mn(3+)Tf and biophysical tools, we have developed a novel approach to study Mn(3+)Tf transport independently of other Mn transport mechanisms. This approach was used to compare the uptake of Mn(3+)Tf into neuronal cell lines with published descriptions of Fe(3+) uptake via the Tf mechanism, and to obtain quantitative information on Mn uptake via the Tf mechanism. Results confirm that in these cell lines significant Mn(3+) is transported by the Tf mechanism similarly to Fe(3+)Tf transport; although Mn(3+)Tf transport is markedly slower than other Mn transport mechanisms. This novel approach may prove useful for studying Mn toxicity in other systems and cell types.
7909690	Cytotoxic effects of inhibitors of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis upon Plasmodium falciparum.	The malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum can only synthesize pyrimidine nucleotides via the de novo pathway which is therefore a suitable target for development of antimalarial drugs. New assay procedures have been developed using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) which enable concurrent measurement of pyrimidine intermediates in malaria. Synchronized parasites growing in erythrocytes were pulse-labeled with [14C]bicarbonate at 6-h intervals around the 48-h asexual life cycle. Analysis of malarial extracts by HPLC showed tht incorporation of [14C]bicarbonate into pyrimidine nucleotides was maximal during the transition from trophozoites to schizonts. The reaction, N-carbamyl-L-aspartate-->L-dihydroorotate (CA-asp-->DHO) catalyzed by malarial dihydroorotase is inhibited by L-6-thiodihydroorotate (TDHO) in vitro (Ki = 6.5 microM), and TDHO, as the free acid or methyl ester, induces a major accumulation of CA-asp in malaria. Atovaquone, a naphthoquinone, is a moderate inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase in vitro (Ki = 27 microM) but induces major accumulations of CA-asp and DHO. Pyrazofurin induces accumulation of orotate and orotidine in malaria, consistent with inhibition of orotidine 5'-monophosphate (OMP) decarboxylase with subsequent dephosphorylation of the OMP accumulated. Although TDHO, atovaquone, and pyrazofurin arrest the growth of P. falciparum, only moderate decreases in UTP, CTP, and dTTP were observed. 5-Fluoroorotate also arrests the growth of P. falciparum with major accumulations of 5-fluorouridine mono-, di-, and triphosphates and the most significant inhibition of de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides.
17251447	RPE65 is essential for the function of cone photoreceptors in NRL-deficient mice.	"PURPOSE: Phototransduction in cones is initiated by the bleaching of their visual pigment, which comprises a protein component-cone opsin-and a vitamin A derivative-11-cis retinal. Little is known about the source of 11-cis retinal for cones. In the current study, neural retina leucine zipper-deficient (Nrl(-/-)) and rod opsin (Rho(-/-))-deficient mice were used, two mouse models that have been described as having a ""cone-only"" retina, to analyze the retinoid metabolism of cones. In addition, these mice were bred to retinal pigment epithelial protein 65 (Rpe65(-/-))-deficient mice to study the role of RPE65. METHODS: Mice were analyzed using morphology, Western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry, electroretinography (ERG), and retinoid profiling by HPLC. RESULTS: In comparison to wild-type mice, the retina of Nrl(-/-) mice contained elevated levels of RPE65 and cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein (CRALBP), suggesting a particular role of these two proteins for the retinoid metabolism of cones. In Nrl(-/-) mice, different retinoid species were present in proportions similar to wild type. Ablation of RPE65 in Nrl(-/-) and Rho(-/-) mice led to the absence of 11-cis retinal, but increased the total retinoid content, with retinyl esters representing the most abundant retinoid species. In the absence of RPE65, retinal sensitivity in Nrl(-/-) mice dropped by a factor of a thousand. CONCLUSIONS: The data show that RPE65, previously shown to be essential for rod function, is also indispensable for the production of 11-cis retinal for cones and thus for cone function."
23300000	Influence of rare earth elements on metabolism and related enzyme activity and isozyme expression in Tetrastigma hemsleyanum cell suspension cultures.	The effects of rare earth elements (REEs) not only on cell growth and flavonoid accumulation of Tetrastigma hemsleyanum suspension cells but also on the isoenzyme patterns and activities of related enzymes were studied in this paper. There were no significant differences in enhancement of flavonoid accumulation in T. hemsleyanum suspension cells among La(3+), Ce(3+), and Nd(3+). Whereas their inductive effects on cell proliferation varied greatly. The most significant effects were achieved with 100 μM Ce(3+)and Nd(3+). Under treatment over a 25-day culture period, the maximal biomass levels reached 1.92- and 1.74-fold and the total flavonoid contents are 1.45- and 1.49-fold, than that of control, respectively. Catalase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), and peroxidase (POD) activity was activated significantly when the REE concentration range from 0 to 300 μM, whereas no significant changes were found in superoxide dismutase activity. Differences of esterase isozymes under REE treatment only laid in expression level, and there were no specific bands. The expression level of some POD isozymes strengthened with increasing concentration of REEs within the range of 50-200 μM. When REE concentration was higher than 300 μM, the expression of some POD isozymes was inhibited; meanwhile, some other new POD isozymes were induced. Our results also showed REEs did not directly influence PAL activity. So, we speculated that 50-200 μM REEs could activate some of antioxidant enzymes, adjust some isozymes expression, trigger the defense responses of T. hemsleyanum suspension cells, and stimulate flavonoid accumulation by inducing PAL activity.
15169831	Ethanol suppression of ventral tegmental area GABA neuron electrical transmission involves N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors.	Ventral tegmental area (VTA) GABA neurons are critical substrates modulating the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system implicated in natural and drug reward. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of ethanol on glutamatergic and GABAergic modulation of VTA GABA neuron electrical synaptic transmission. We evaluated the effects of systemic ethanol (0.05-2.0 g/kg i.p.), the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist dizocilpine (MK-801; 0.05-0.2 mg/kg i.v.), the connexin-36 gap junction blocker quinidine (5-20 mg/kg i.v.), the fast-acting barbiturate methohexital (Brevital; 5-10 mg/kg i.v.), and the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide (Librium; 5-10 mg/kg i.v.), as well as in situ VTA administration of NMDA and the GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol, on VTA GABA neuron spontaneous activity and internal capsule stimulus-induced poststimulus spike discharges (ICPSDs). Systemic ethanol, quinidine, and dizocilpine reduced, whereas local NMDA enhanced, and the systemic and local GABA(A) receptor modulators did not significantly alter VTA GABA neuron ICPSDs. Ethanol potentiated dizocilpine inhibition of VTA GABA neuron ICPSDs, but not quinidine inhibition. In situ microelectrophoretic application of dopamine markedly enhanced VTA GABA neuron firing rate (131%), spike duration (124%), and spike coupling, which were blocked by systemic quinidine. These findings indicate that VTA GABA neurons are coupled electrically via gap junctions and that the inhibitory effect of ethanol on electrical transmission is primarily via inhibition of NMDA receptor-mediated excitation, not via enhancement of GABA receptor-mediated inhibition. Thus, the rewarding properties of ethanol may result from inhibitory effects on excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission between electrically coupled networks of midbrain GABA neurons.
23524663	Metabolism Studies of Unformulated Internally [3H]-labeled siRNAs in Mice.	Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion properties of two unformulated model siRNAs were determined using a single internal [(3)H]-radiolabeling procedure, where the full-length oligonucleotides were radiolabeled by Br/(3)H-exchange. Tissue distribution, excretion, and mass balance of radioactivity were investigated in male CD-1 mice, following a single intravenous administration of the [(3)H]-siRNAs, at a target dose level of 5 mg/kg. Quantitative whole-body autoradiography (QWBA) and liquid scintillation counting techniques were used to determine tissue distribution. Radiochromatogram profiles were determined in plasma, tissue extracts and urine. Metabolites were separated by liquid chromatography and identified by radiodetection and high-resolution accurate mass spectrometry. In general, there was little difference in the distribution of total radiolabeled components after administration of the two unformulated [(3)H]-siRNAs. The radioactivity was rapidly and widely distributed throughout the body, and remained detectable in all tissues investigated at later time points (24 and 48 hours for [(3)H]-MRP4 and [(3)H]-SSB siRNA, respectively). After an initial rapid decline, concentrations of total radiolabeled components in dried blood declined at a much slower rate. A nearly complete mass balance was obtained for the [(3)H]-SSB siRNA and renal excretion was the main route of elimination (38%). The metabolism of the two model siRNAs was rapid and extensive. Five minutes after administration, no parent compound could be detected in plasma. Instead, radiolabeled nucleosides resulting from nuclease hydrolysis were observed. In the metabolism profiles obtained from various tissues only radiolabeled nucleosides were found, suggesting that siRNAs are rapidly metabolized and that the distribution pattern of total radiolabeled components can be ascribed to small molecular weight metabolites.
23151612	A review of anti-inflammatory agents for symptoms of schizophrenia.	Schizophrenia is a chronic debilitating mental disorder that affects about 1% of the US population. The pathophysiology and etiology remain unknown, thus new treatment targets have been challenging and few novel treatments with new mechanisms of action have come to market in the past few decades. Increasing attention has been paid to the role of inflammation in schizophrenia and new data suggests that decreasing inflammation and inflammatory biomarkers may play some role in schizophrenia treatment. This review summarizes the clinical trial literature regarding medications that possess anti-inflammatory properties that have been tested for schizophrenia symptoms and covers such medications as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, such as the cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors and aspirin, omega-3 fatty acids, neurosteroids and minocycline. Overall, there is accumulating evidence, albeit mostly adjunctive treatments, that agents working on inflammatory pathways have some benefits in people with schizophrenia. In the next few years the field will begin to see data on many treatments with anti-inflammatory properties that are currently under study. Hopefully advancements in understanding inflammation and effective treatments having anti-inflammatory properties may help revolutionize our understanding and provide new targets for prevention and treatment in schizophrenia.
23396185	Quercetin prevents protein nitration and glycolytic block of proliferation in hydrogen peroxide insulted cultured neuronal precursor cells (NPCs): Implications on CNS regeneration.	Survival along with optimal proliferation of neuronal precursors determines the outcomes of the endogenous cellular repair in CNS. Cellular-oxidation based cell death has been described in several neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, this study was aimed at the identification of the potent targets of oxidative damage to the neuronal precursors and its effective prevention by a natural flavonoid, Quercetin. Neuronal precursor cells (NPCs), Nestin+ and GFAP (Glial fibrillary acidic protein)+ were isolated and cultured from adult rat SVZ (subventricular zone). These cells were challenged with a single dose of H2O2 (50μM) and/or pre-treated with different concentrations of Quercetin. H2O2 severely limited the cellular viability and expansion of the neurospheres. Cellular-oxidation studies revealed reduction in glutathione dependent redox buffering along with depletion of enzymatic cellular antioxidants that might potentiate the nitrite (NO2(-)) and superoxide anion (O2(-)) mediated peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) formation and irreversible protein nitration. We identified depleted PK-M2 (M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase) activity and apoptosis of NPCs revealed by the genomic DNA fragmentation and elevated PARP (poly ADP ribose polymerase) activity along with increased Caspase activity initiated by severely depolarised mitochondrial membranes. However, the pre-treatment of Quercetin in a dose-response manner prevented these changes and restored the expansion of neurospheres preferably by neutralizing the oxidative conditions and thereby reducing peroxynitrite formation, protein nitration and PK-M2 depletion. Our results unravel the potential interactions of oxidative environment and respiration in the survival and activation of precursors and offer a promise shown by a natural flavonoid in the protective strategy for neuronal precursors of adult brain.
23607712	Synaptotagmin 1 is required for vesicular Ca(2+) /H(+) -antiport activity.	A low-affinity Ca(2+) /H(+) -antiport was described in the membrane of mammalian brain synaptic vesicles. Electrophysiological studies showed that this antiport contributes to the extreme brevity of excitation-release coupling in rapid synapses. Synaptotagmin-1, a vesicular protein interacting with membranes upon low-affinity Ca(2+) -binding, plays a major role in excitation-release coupling, by synchronizing calcium entry with fast neurotransmitter release. Here, we report that synaptotagmin-1 is necessary for expression of the vesicular Ca(2+) /H(+) -antiport. We measured Ca(2+) /H(+) -antiport activity in vesicles and granules of pheochromocytoma PC12 cells by three methods: (1) Ca(2+) -induced dissipation of the vesicular H(+) -gradient; (2) bafilomycin-sensitive calcium accumulation and (3) pH-jump-induced calcium accumulation. The results were congruent and highly significant: Ca(2+) /H(+) -antiport activity is detectable only in acidic organelles expressing functional synaptotagmin-1. In contrast, synaptotagmin-1-deficient cells - and cells where transgenically encoded synaptotagmin-1 was acutely photo-inactivated - were devoid of any Ca(2+) /H(+) -antiport activity. Therefore, in addition to its previously described functions, synaptotagmin-1 is involved in a rapid vesicular Ca(2+) sequestration through a Ca(2+) /H(+) antiport.

14507899	P2Y(2) receptor agonist INS37217 enhances functional recovery after detachment caused by subretinal injection in normal and rds mice.	PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of INS37217 on the recovery of retinal function after experimental retinal detachment induced by subretinal injection. METHODS: Subretinal injections of 1 micro L of fluorescent microbeads, saline, or INS37217 (1-200 micro M) were made by the transvitreal method in normal (C57BL/6) mice and in mice heterozygous for the retinal degeneration slow (rds) gene. Control, mock-injected animals underwent corneal puncture without injection. Histologic and ERG evaluations were made at 0 to 1 and 8 hours, and 1, 3, 7, 10, 14, and 60 days post injection (PI). DNA fragmentation was evaluated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated uridine 5'-triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL). RESULTS: A single subretinal injection of saline solution containing fluorescent beads caused a histologically evident retinal detachment and distributed the microbeads to almost all the subretinal space. Spontaneous reattachment occurred within 24 hours after injection and was accompanied by evident retinal folding that appeared largely resolved by 6 days later. Relative to controls, injection of saline resulted in approximately 40% recovery of dark-adapted a-wave amplitude at 24 hours PI and gradually improved to approximately 90% of controls at 2 months PI. Subretinal injection of saline containing INS37217 (10 micro M) significantly increased rod and cone ERG of normal and rds(+/-) mice at 1 and 10 days PI, when compared with injection of saline alone. Additionally, INS37217 reduced the number of TUNEL-positive photoreceptors and the enhanced rate of reattachment. CONCLUSIONS: Enhancement of ERG recovery by INS37217 is likely due to reduced retinal folding and cell death associated with detachment. These results support the use of INS37217 to help restore function after therapies that involve subretinal administration of drugs in animal models of retinal diseases.
6621777	The effect of various amino acids and drugs on the para- and meta-hydroxyphenylacetic acid concentrations in the mouse caudate nucleus.	Injection of L-p-tyrosine (800 mg/kg, 2 h) increased the mouse striatal para-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (p-HPAA) concentrations. A smaller dose of D,L-m-tyrosine (20 mg/kg, 2 h) produced a larger increase in mouse striatal meta-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (m-HPAA) concentrations. The administration of L-phenylalanine to mice caused a slight increase in the p-HPAA concentration in the corpus striatum after 2 h while a larger dose of L-phenylalanine (800 mg/kg) produced a greater increase. Eight hours following L-phenylalanine injection, p-HPAA concentrations were still elevated. With D-phenylalanine a significant increase was observed at eight hours after drug administration. Two drugs which reduce dopamine synthesis, alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine and apomorphine, decreased m-HPAA striatal concentrations without affecting p-HPAA concentrations. From these results, it is proposed that tyrosine hydroxylase activity determines p-HPAA concentrations by regulating p-tyrosine availability. This enzyme may also synthesize m-tyrosine which is subsequently decarboxylated to form m-tyramine and then oxidatively deaminated to form m-HPAA.
10953053	Retigabine, a novel anti-convulsant, enhances activation of KCNQ2/Q3 potassium channels.	Retigabine [N-(2-amino-4-[fluorobenzylamino]-phenyl) carbamic acid; D-23129] is a novel anticonvulsant, unrelated to currently available antiepileptic agents, with activity in a broad range of seizure models. In the present study, we sought to determine whether retigabine could enhance current through M-like currents in PC12 cells and KCNQ2/Q3 K(+) channels expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-KCNQ2/Q3). In differentiated PC12 cells, retigabine enhanced a linopirdine-sensitive current. The effect of retigabine was associated with a slowing of M-like tail current deactivation in these cells. Retigabine (0.1 to 10 microM) induced a potassium current and hyperpolarized CHO cells expressing KCNQ2/Q3 cells but not in wild-type cells. Retigabine-induced currents in CHO-KCNQ2/Q3 cells were inhibited by 60.6 +/- 11% (n = 4) by the KCNQ2/Q3 blocker, linopirdine (10 microM), and 82.7 +/- 5.4% (n = 4) by BaCl(2) (10 mM). The mechanism by which retigabine enhanced KCNQ2/Q3 currents involved large, drug-induced, leftward shifts in the voltage dependence of channel activation (-33.1 +/- 2.6 mV, n = 4, by 10 microM retigabine). Retigabine shifted the voltage dependence of channel activation with an EC(50) value of 1.6 +/- 0.3 microM (slope factor was 1.2 +/- 0.1, n = 4 to 5 cells per concentration). Retigabine (0.1 to 10 microM) also slowed the rate of channel deactivation, predominantly by increasing the contribution of a slowly deactivating tail current component. Our findings identify KCNQ2/Q3 channels as a molecular target for retigabine and suggest that activation of KCNQ2/Q3 channels may be responsible for at least some of the anticonvulsant activity of this agent.
23481676	Cytotoxic and Anti-Inflammatory Eunicellin-Based Diterpenoids from the Soft Coral Cladiella krempfi.	Five new eunicellin-based diterpenoids, krempfielins E-I (1-5) and seven known compounds (6-12) were isolated from the organic extract of a Taiwanese soft coral Cladiella krempfi. The structures of the new metabolites were elucidated on the basis of extensive spectroscopic analysis. Metabolites 5, 6, 10 and 12 were shown to exhibit cytotoxicity against a limited panel of cancer cell lines. Furthermore, compounds 6 and 10 could potently inhibit the accumulation of the pro-inflammatory iNOS protein, and 6 and 12 could significantly reduce the expression of COX-2 protein in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophage cells.
22614014	Macrophage cathepsin K promotes prostate tumor progression in bone.	Bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) share common progenitors with osteoclasts and are critical components of bone-tumor microenvironment; however, their function in prostate tumor growth in the skeleton has not been explored. BMMs are the major source of inflammatory factors and proteases, including cysteine protease cathepsin K (CTSK). In this study, utilizing mice deficient in CTSK, we demonstrate the critical involvement of this potent collagenase in tumor progression in bone. We present the evidence that tumor growth and progression in the bone are impaired in the absence of CTSK. Most importantly, we show for the first time that BMM-supplied CTSK may be involved in CCL2- and COX-2-driven pathways that contribute to tumor progression in bone. Together, our data unravel novel roles for CTSK in macrophage-regulated processes, and provide evidence for close interplay between inflammatory, osteolytic and tumor cell-driven events in the bone-tumor microenvironment.
16477002	Crystal structure of the IL-2 signaling complex: paradigm for a heterotrimeric cytokine receptor.	IL-2 is a cytokine that functions as a growth factor and central regulator in the immune system and mediates its effects through ligand-induced hetero-trimerization of the receptor subunits IL-2R alpha, IL-2R beta, and gamma(c). Here, we describe the crystal structure of the trimeric assembly of the human IL-2 receptor ectodomains in complex with IL-2 at 3.0 A resolution. The quaternary structure is consistent with a stepwise assembly from IL-2/IL-2R alpha to IL-2/IL-2R alpha/IL-2R beta to IL-2/IL-2R alpha/IL-2R beta/gamma(c). The IL-2R alpha subunit forms the largest of the three IL-2/IL-2R interfaces, which, together with the high abundance of charge-charge interactions, correlates well with the rapid association rate and high-affinity interaction of IL-2R alpha with IL-2 at the cell surface. Surprisingly, IL-2R alpha makes no contacts with IL-2R beta or gamma(c), and only minor changes are observed in the IL-2 structure in response to receptor binding. These findings support the principal role of IL-2R alpha to deliver IL-2 to the signaling complex and act as regulator of signal transduction. Cooperativity in assembly of the final quaternary complex is easily explained by the extraordinarily extensive set of interfaces found within the fully assembled IL-2 signaling complex, which nearly span the entire length of the IL-2R beta and gamma(c) subunits. Helix A of IL-2 wedges tightly between IL-2R beta and gamma(c) to form a three-way junction that coalesces into a composite binding site for the final gamma(c) recruitment. The IL-2/gamma(c) interface itself exhibits the smallest buried surface and the fewest hydrogen bonds in the complex, which is consistent with its promiscuous use in other cytokine receptor complexes.
23299909	Interruption or deferral of antiretroviral therapy reduces markers of bone turnover compared with continuous therapy: The SMART Body Composition substudy.	Bone mineral density (BMD) declines significantly in HIV patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART). We compared the effects of intermittent versus continuous ART on markers of bone turnover in the Body Composition substudy of the Strategies for Management of AntiRetroviral Therapy (SMART) trial and determined whether early changes in markers predicted subsequent change in BMD. For 202 participants (median age 44 years, 17% female, 74% on ART) randomised to continuous or intermittent ART, plasma markers of inflammation and bone turnover were evaluated at baseline, months 4 and 12; BMD at the spine (dual X-ray absorptiometry [DXA] and computed tomography) and hip (DXA) was evaluated annually. Compared to the continuous ART group, mean bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bALP), osteocalcin, procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP), N-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type 1 collagen (NTX), and C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type 1 collagen (βCTX) decreased significantly in the intermittent ART group, whereas RANKL and the RANKL:osteoprotegerin (OPG) ratio increased (all p<0.002 at month 4 and month 12). Increases in bALP, osteocalcin, P1NP, NTX, and βCTX at month 4 predicted decrease in hip BMD at month 12, while increases in RANKL and the RANKL:OPG ratio at month 4 predicted increase in hip and spine BMD at month 12. This study has shown that compared with continuous ART, interruption of ART results in a reduction in markers of bone turnover and increase in BMD at hip and spine, and that early changes in markers of bone turnover predict BMD changes at 12 months. © 2013 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.
23643828	The C1 domain-targeted isophthalate derivative HMI-1b11 promotes neurite outgrowth and GAP-43 expression through PKCα activation in SH-SY5Y cells.	Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of serine/threonine phosphotransferases ubiquitously expressed and involved in multiple cellular functions, such as proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. The C1 domain of PKC represents an attractive drug target, especially for developing PKC activators. Dialkyl 5-(hydroxymethyl)isophthalates are a novel group of synthetic C1 domain ligands that exhibit antiproliferative effect in HeLa cervical carcinoma cells. Here we selected two isophthalates, HMI-1a3 and HMI-1b11, and characterized their effects in the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y. Both of the active isophthalates exhibited significant antiproliferative and differentiation-inducing effects. Since HMI-1b11 did not impair cell survival even at the highest concentration tested (20μM), and supported neurite growth and differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells, we focused on studying its downstream signaling cascades and effects on gene expression. Consistently, genome-wide gene expression microarray and gene set enrichment analysis indicated that HMI-1b11 (10μM) induced changes in genes mainly related to cell differentiation. In particular, further studies revealed that HMI-1b11 exposure induced up-regulation of GAP-43, a marker for neurite sprouting and neuronal differentiation. These effects were induced by a 7-minute HMI-1b11 treatment and specifically depended on PKCα activation, since pretreatment with the selective inhibitor Gö6976 abolished the up-regulation of GAP-43 protein observed at 12hours In parallel, we found that a 7-minute exposure to HMI-1b11 induced PKCα accumulation to the cytoskeleton, an effect that was again prevented by pretreatment with Gö6976. Despite similar binding affinities to PKC, the isophthalates had different effects on PKC-dependent ERK1/2 signaling: HMI-1a3-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation was transient, while HMI-1b11 induced a rapid but prolonged ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Overall our data are in accordance with previous studies showing that activation of the PKCα and ERK1/2 pathways participate in regulating neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, since PKC has been classified as one of the cognitive kinases, and activation of PKC is considered a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cognitive disorders, our findings suggest that HMI-1b11 represents a promising lead compound in research aimed to prevent or counteract memory impairment.
23578952	Monoacylglycerol lipase inhibition-induced changes in plasma corticosterone levels, anxiety and locomotor activity in male CD1 mice.	"The hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal-axis is strongly controlled by the endocannabinoid system. The specific impact of enhanced 2-arachidonoylglycerol signaling on corticosterone plasma levels, however, was not investigated so far. Here we studied the effects of the recently developed monoacylglycerol lipase inhibitor JZL184 on basal and stress-induced corticosterone levels in male CD1 mice, and found that this compound dramatically increased basal levels without affecting stress responses. Since acute changes in corticosterone levels can affect behavior, JZL184 was administered concurrently with the corticosterone synthesis inhibitor metyrapone, to investigate whether the previously shown behavioral effects of JZL184 are dependent on corticosterone. We found that in the elevated plus-maze, the effects of JZL184 on ""classical"" anxiety-related measures were abolished by corticosterone synthesis blockade. By contrast, effects on the ""ethological"" measures of anxiety (i.e. risk assessment) were not affected by metyrapone. In the open-field, the locomotion-enhancing effects of the compound were not changed either. These findings show that monoacylglycerol lipase inhibition dramatically increases basal levels of corticosterone. This endocrine effect partly affects the anxiolytic, but not the locomotion-enhancing effects of monoacylglycerol lipase blockade."
9710435	Ibuprofen inhibits cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator-mediated Cl- secretion.	We evaluated the acute effects of ibuprofen and salicylic acid on cAMP-mediated Cl- secretion (Isc) in both colonic and airway epithelia. In T84 cells, ibuprofen inhibited the forskolin-dependent Isc in a concentration-dependent manner, having an apparent Ki of 142 microM. Salicylic acid inhibited Isc with an apparent Ki of 646 microM. We determined whether ibuprofen would also inhibit the forskolin-stimulated Isc in primary cultures of mouse trachea epithelia (MTE) and human bronchial epithelia (HBE). Similar to our results in T84 cells, ibuprofen (500 microM) inhibited the forskolin-induced Isc in MTEs and HBEs by 59+/-4% (n = 11) and 39+/-6% (n = 8), respectively. Nystatin was employed to selectively permeabilize the basolateral or apical membrane to determine the effect of ibuprofen on apical Cl- (ICl) and basolateral K+ (IK) currents after stimulation by forskolin. After forskolin stimulation, ibuprofen (500 microM) reduced both the ICl and IK; reducing ICl and IK by 60 and 15%, respectively. To determine whether this inhibition of ICl was due to the inhibition of CFTR, the effects of ibuprofen and salicylic acid on CFTR Cl- channels in excised, inside-out patches from L-cells were evaluated. Ibuprofen (300 microM) reduced CFTR Cl- current by 60+/-16% and this was explained by a short-lived block (approximately 1.2 ms) which causes an apparent reduction in single channel amplitude from 1.07+/-0.04 pA to 0.59+/-0.04 pA (n = 3). Similarly, salicylic acid (3 mM) reduced CFTR Cl- current by 50+/-8% with an apparent reduction in single channel amplitude from 1.08+/-0.03 pA to 0.48+/-0.06 pA (n = 4). Based on these results, we conclude that the NSAIDs ibuprofen and salicylic acid inhibit cAMP-mediated Cl- secretion in human colonic and airway epithelia via a direct inhibition of CFTR Cl- channels as well as basolateral membrane K+ channels. This may reduce their efficacy in conjunction with other therapeutic strategies designed to increase CFTR expression and/or function in secretory epithelia.
23382381	Supervillin-mediated suppression of p53 protein enhances cell survival.	Integrin-based adhesions promote cell survival as well as cell motility and invasion. We show here that the adhesion regulatory protein supervillin increases cell survival by decreasing levels of the tumor suppressor protein p53 and downstream target genes. RNAi-mediated knockdown of a new splice form of supervillin (isoform 4) or both isoforms 1 and 4 increases the amount of p53 and cell death, whereas p53 levels decrease after overexpression of either supervillin isoform. Cellular responses to DNA damage induced by etoposide or doxorubicin include down-regulation of endogenous supervillin coincident with increases in p53. In DNA-damaged supervillin knockdown cells, p53 knockdown or inhibition partially rescues the loss of cell metabolic activity, a measure of cell proliferation. Knockdown of the p53 deubiquitinating enzyme USP7/HAUSP also reverses the supervillin phenotype, blocking the increase in p53 levels seen after supervillin knockdown and accentuating the decrease in p53 levels triggered by supervillin overexpression. Conversely, supervillin overexpression decreases the association of USP7 and p53 and attenuates USP7-mediated p53 deubiquitination. USP7 binds directly to the supervillin N terminus and can deubiquitinate and stabilize supervillin. Supervillin also is stabilized by derivatization with the ubiquitin-like protein SUMO1. These results show that supervillin regulates cell survival through control of p53 levels and suggest that supervillin and its interaction partners at sites of cell-substrate adhesion constitute a locus for cross-talk between survival signaling and cell motility pathways.
17203264	Fluorescent sensing layer for the determination of L-malic acid in wine.	An enzymatic method for determining L-malic acid in wine based on an L-malate sensing layer with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), L-malate dehydrogenase (L-MDH) and diaphorase (DI), immobilized by sol-gel technology, was constructed and evaluated. The sol-gel glass was prepared with tetramethoxysilane (TMOS), water and HCl. L-MDH catalyzes the reaction between L-malate and NAD+, producing NADH, whose fluorescence (lambdaexc=340 nm, lambdaem=430 nm) could be directly related to the amount of L-malate. NADH is converted to NAD+ by applying hexacyanoferrate(III) as oxidant in the presence of DI. Some parameters affecting sol-gel encapsulation and the pH of the enzymatic reaction were studied. The sensing layer has a dynamic range of 0.1-1.0 g/L of L-malate and a long-term storage stability of 25 days. It exhibits acceptable reproducibility [sr(%) approximately 10] and allows six regenerations. The content of L-malic acid was determined for different types of wine, and polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) was used as a bleaching agent with red wine. The results obtained for the wine samples using the sensing layer are comparable to those obtained from a reference method based on UV-vis molecular absorption spectrometry, if the matrix effect is corrected for.
23270965	Safrole-2',3'-oxide induces atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability in apolipoprotein E-knockout mice.	Safrole-2',3'-oxide (SFO) is the major electrophilic metabolite of safrole (4-allyl-1, 2-methylenedioxybenzene), a natural plant constituent found in essential oils of numerous edible herbs and spices and in food containing these herbs, such as pesto sauce, cola beverages and bologna sausages. The effects of SFO in mammalian systems, especially the cardiovascular system, are little known. Disruption of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques in atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory disease, is the main cause of cardiovascular events. In this study, we investigated SFO-induced atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability (possibility of rupture) in apolipoprotein E-knockout (apoE(-/-)) mice. Lipid area in vessel wall reached 59.8% in high dose SFO (SFO-HD) treated group, which is only 31.2% in control group. SFO treatment changed the lesion composition to an unstable phenotype, increased the number of apoptotic cells in plaque and the endothelium in plaques was damaged after SFO treatment. Furthermore, compared with control groups, the plaque endothelium level of p75(NTR) was 3-fold increased and the liver level of p75(NTR) was 17.4-fold increased by SFO-HD. Meanwhile, the serum level of KC (a functional homolog of IL-8 and the main proinflammatory alpha chemokine in mice) in apoE(-/-) mice was up to 357pg/ml in SFO-HD treated group. Thus, SFO contributes to the instability of atherosclerotic plaque in apoE(-/-) mice through activating p75(NTR) and IL-8 and cell apoptosis in plaque.
2506486	Effects of monoamine oxidase inhibitors on levels of catechols and homovanillic acid in striatum and plasma.	Levels of homovanillic acid (HVA), dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG) in plasma and the striatium were measured after inhibition of monoamine oxidase type A (MAO-A) by clorgyline (4 mg/kg i.p.), MAO-B by (-)deprenyl (1 mg/kg i.p.), both MAO-A and MAO-B by nialamide (75 mg/kg i.p.) or peripheral neuronal MAO by debrisoquin (40 mg/kg i.p.). Levels of HVA in plasma decreased by about 60% after single doses of nialamide or clorgyline, by about 80% after repeated doses of nialamide, by about 40% after a single dose of debrisoquin and by about 50% after repeated doses of debrisoquin. The administration of clorgyline, nialamide or debrisoquin significantly decreased concentrations of DOPAC and DHPG in plasma, whereas (-)deprenyl did not affect levels of DHPG or HVA. None of the MAO inhibitors produced more than about 80% depression of levels of any of the deaminated metabolites. The results suggest that most of the HVA in plasma is derived from deamination of DA by MAO-A in peripheral neurons; that DOPAC in plasma is derived from cells outside the central nervous system; that DHPG in plasma is derived virtually exclusively from the metabolism of norepinephrine in sympathetic nerve endings and that residual levels of HVA after treatment with debrisoquin provide an improved but limited indication of central dopaminergic activity.
23613012	HDL Cholesterol Subfractions and the Effect of Testosterone Replacement in Hypogonadism.	Metabolic disorders and cardiovascular events are increased in hypogonadism. Serum HDL composition is a better cardiovascular predictor than the HDL counts. However, there is no information about the HDL subfractions in patients with hypogonadism. We designed a prospective study to investigate the HDL subfractions in treatment naïve subjects with hypogonadism and the effects of 2 different testosterone replacement regimens on the HDL subfractions. Seventy young male patients with congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH) and 70 age and BMI-matched healthy males were enrolled in the present study. The patients were assigned to receive intramuscular injections of testosterone esters 250 mg every 3 weeks and transdermal testosterone applications 50 mg daily. Biochemical investigations including HDL subfractions and insulin resistance were done. Patients with CHH had higher levels of insulin, HOMA-IR, WC, triglyceride, and diastolic blood pressure. Although, the HDL cholesterol concentrations were similar in both groups, hypogonadal patients had lower HDL2 and higher HDL3 levels. The total testosterone levels were independent determinants of the HDL2 subfractions. During the follow-up, a significant increase in the BMI and WC values and a significant decrease in the levels of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and HDL3 were observed. No difference was present between the 2 treatment arms. These results show that patients with hypogonadism have unfavorable HDL compositions in addition to the other dysmetabolic features. However, testosterone replacement for about six months neither improves the metabolic problems nor the HDL composition. Mechanistic studies are warranted to better understand the cardiovascular effects of unfavorable HDL compositions in hypogonadism.
23623790	GABAA receptor modulation by piperine and a non-TRPV1 activating derivative.	The action of piperine (the pungent component of pepper) and its derivative SCT-66 ((2E,4E)-5-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl))-N,N-diisobutyl-2,4-pentadienamide) on different gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A (GABAA) receptors, transient-receptor-potential-vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) receptors and behavioral effects were investigated. GABAA receptor subtypes and TRPV1 receptors were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Modulation of GABA-induced chloride currents (IGABA) by piperine and SCT-66 and activation of TRPV1 was studied using the two-microelectrode-voltage-clamp technique and fast perfusion. Their effects on explorative behavior, thermoregulation and seizure threshold were analyzed in mice. Piperine acted with similar potency on all GABAA receptor subtypes (EC50 range: 42.8±7.6μM (α2β2)-59.6±12.3μM (α3β2)). IGABA modulation by piperine did not require the presence of a γ2S-subunit, suggesting a binding site involving only α and β subunits. IGABA activation was slightly more efficacious on receptors formed from β2/3 subunits (maximal IGABA stimulation through α1β3 receptors: 332±64% and α1β2: 271±36% vs. α1β1: 171±22%, p<0.05) and α3-subunits (α3β2: 375±51% vs. α5β2:136±22%, p<0.05). Replacing the piperidine ring by a N-di-isobutyl residue (SCT-66) prevents interactions with TRPV1 and simultaneously increases the potency and efficiency of GABAA receptor modulation. SCT-66 displayed greater efficacy on GABAA receptors than piperine, with different subunit-dependence. Both compounds induced anxiolytic, anticonvulsant effects and reduced locomotor activity; however, SCT-66 induced stronger anxiolysis without decreasing body temperature and without the proconvulsive effects of TRPV1 activation and thus may serve as a scaffold for the development of novel GABAA receptor modulators.
9486667	Molecular determinants of dofetilide block of HERG K+ channels.	The human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) encodes a K+ channel with biophysical properties nearly identical to the rapid component of the cardiac delayed rectifier K+ current (IKr). HERG/IKr channels are a prime target for the pharmacological management of arrhythmias and are selectively blocked by class III antiarrhythmic methanesulfonanilide drugs, such as dofetilide, E4031, and MK-499, at submicromolar concentrations. By contrast, the closely related bovine ether-a-go-go channel (BEAG) is 100-fold less sensitive to dofetilide. To identify the molecular determinants for dofetilide block, we first engineered chimeras between HERG and BEAG and then used site-directed mutagenesis to localize single amino acid residues responsible for block. Using constructs heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes, we found that transplantation of the S5-S6 linker from BEAG into HERG removed high-affinity block by dofetilide. A point mutation in the S5-S6 linker region, HERG S620T, abolished high-affinity block and interfered with C-type inactivation. Thus, our results indicate that important determinants of dofetilide binding are localized to the pore region of HERG. Since the loss of high-affinity drug binding was always correlated with a loss of C-type inactivation, it is possible that the changes observed in drug binding are due to indirect allosteric modifications in the structure of the channel protein and not to the direct interaction of dofetilide with the respective mutated site chains. However, the chimeric approach was not able to identify domains outside the S5-S6 linker region of the HERG channel as putative candidates involved in drug binding. Moreover, the reverse mutation BEAG T432S increased the affinity of BEAG K+ channels for dofetilide, whereas C-type inactivation could not be recovered. Thus, the serine in position HERG 620 may participate directly in dofetilide binding; however, an intact C-type inactivation process seems to be crucial for high-affinity drug binding.
17317527	Role of combined administration of Tiron and glutathione against aluminum-induced oxidative stress in rat brain.	The current study was carried out to investigate the potential role of 4,5 dihydroxy benzene 1,3 disulfonic acid di sodium salt (Tiron) and glutathione (GSH) either individually or in combination against aluminum (Al)-induced toxicity in Wistar rats. Animals were exposed to aluminum chloride at a dose of 172.5mg/kg/d orally for 10 weeks. Tiron and GSH were administered at a dose of 471-mg/kg/d i.p. and 100mg/kg/d orally, respectively, for 7 consecutive days. Tiron is a diphenolic chelating compound which forms water soluble complexes with a large number of metal ions. Induction of oxidative stress was recorded in brain and serum after Al exposure. Significant decrease was recorded in reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GP(x)), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), acetyl cholinesterase (AChE) and an increase was observed in thiobarbituric acid reacting substance (TBARS) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) in brain and serum. Most of the above parameters responded positively to individual therapy with Tiron, but more pronounced beneficial effects on the above-described parameters were observed when Tiron was administered in combination with GSH. Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES) studies also showed significantly high concentration of Al in brain and blood. Tiron was slightly more effective then GSH in reducing the concentration of Al from the brain and blood, however, no further improvement was recorded when Tiron was administered in combination with GSH in reducing the concentration of Al.
11156594	alpha(1B) adrenergic receptors in gonadotrophin-releasing hormone neurones: relation to Transport-P.	1. Peptidergic neurones accumulate amines via an unusual uptake process, designated Transport-P. [(3)H]-prazosin binds to alpha(1) adrenoceptors on these cells and is displaceable by unlabelled prazosin in concentrations up to 10(-7) M. However, at greater concentrations of prazosin, there is a paradoxical accumulation of [(3)H]-prazosin which we have attributed to Transport-P. Uptake of prazosin via Transport-P is detectable at 10(-10) M prazosin concentration, is linear up to 10(-7) M and at greater concentrations becomes non-linear. In contrast, in noradrenergic neurones, noradrenaline uptake is linear and saturates above 10(-7) M. In noradrenergic neurones and in non-neuronal cells, there is no uptake of prazosin in concentrations up to 10(-6) M, suggesting that Transport-P is a specialised function of peptidergic neurones. 2. Using a mouse peptidergic (gonadotrophin-releasing hormone, GnRH) neuronal cell line which possesses Transport-P, we have studied the interaction of alpha(1) adrenoceptors with Transport-P. Polymerase chain reactions and DNA sequencing of the products demonstrated that only the alpha(1B) sub-type of adrenoceptors is present in GnRH cells. 3. In COS cells transfected with alpha(1b) adrenoceptor cDNA and in DDT(1) MF-2 cells which express native alpha(1B) adrenoceptors, [(3)H]-prazosin was displaced by unlabelled prazosin in a normal equilibrium process, with no prazosin paradox in concentrations up to 10(-6) M. In DDT(1) MF-2 cells, [(3)H]-prazosin was displaced likewise by a series of alpha(1) adrenergic agonists, none of which increased the binding of [(3)H]-prazosin. Hence, the prazosin paradox is not due to some function of alpha(1) adrenoceptors, such as internalization of ligand-receptor complexes. 4. In neurones which possess Transport-P, transfection with alpha(1b) adrenoceptor cDNA resulted in over-expression of alpha(1B) adrenoceptors, but the prazosin paradox was unaltered. Thus, alpha(1) adrenoceptors and Transport-P mediate distinct functions in peptidergic neurones.
23432420	SNAIL Induces Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition and Cancer Stem Cell-like Properties in Aldehyde Dehydroghenase-Negative Thyroid Cancer Cells.	Background: Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been thought to play a critical role in invasion and metastasis of cancer and to be associated with cancer stem cell (CSC) properties. It is not clear if there is a link between EMT and CSCs in thyroid cancers. We therefore investigated CSC properties of thyroid cancers that underwent EMT. Method: To induce EMT (spindle-like cell morphology, loss and acquisition of expression of an epithelial marker E-cadherin and a mesenchymal marker vimentin, respectively) in an epithelial type thyroid cancer cell line ACT-1, we used transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), BRAFV600E and/or Snail homolog 1 (SNAI1, also known as SNAIL) . CSC properties were analyzed with assays for cell proliferation, chemosensitivity, in vitro and in vivo tumor formation ability, cell surface antigens and intracellular aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH; a known CSC marker) activities. Results: EMT was induced most efficiently by SNAIL (ACT-SNAIL cells), whereas TGF-beta and BRAFV600E were less efficient. ACT-SNAIL cells showed slightly but significantly enhanced tumor formation ability in in vitro sphere assay (~3 fold) but not in vivo subcutaneous tumor growth assay, and showed comparable chemosensitivity, as compared to the parental ACT-1 cells. However, of interest, although in vitro sphere formation ability of ALDH+ cells was almost unchanged after SNAIL induction, SNAIL overexpression induced much higher (~14 fold) spheres in ALDH- cells. Thus, ALDH was no longer a CSC marker in ACT-SNAIL cells. Conclusions: All these data indicate that EMT confers CSC properties in ALDH- cells and appears to influence the ability of ALDH to enrich CSCs.
23267011	DNA polymerase minor groove interactions modulate mutagenic bypass of a templating 8-oxoguanine lesion.	A major base lesion resulting from oxidative stress is 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxoG) that has ambiguous coding potential. Error-free DNA synthesis involves 8-oxoG adopting an anti-conformation to base pair with cytosine whereas mutagenic bypass involves 8-oxoG adopting a syn-conformation to base pair with adenine. Left unrepaired the syn-8-oxoG/dAMP base pair results in a G-C to T-A transversion. During base excision repair of this mispair, DNA polymerase (pol) β is confronted with gap filling opposite 8-oxoG. To determine how pol β discriminates between anti- and syn-8-oxoG, we introduced a point mutation (R283K) to alter insertion specificity. Kinetic studies demonstrate that this substitution results in an increased fidelity opposite 8-oxoG. Structural studies with R283K pol β show that the binary DNA complex has 8-oxoG in equilibrium between anti- and syn-forms. Ternary complexes with incoming dCTP resemble the wild-type enzyme, with templating anti-8-oxoG base pairing with incoming cytosine. In contrast to wild-type pol β, the ternary complex of the R283K mutant with an incoming dATP-analogue and templating 8-oxoG resembles a G-A mismatched structure with 8-oxoG adopting an anti-conformation. These results demonstrate that the incoming nucleotide is unable to induce a syn-8-oxoG conformation without minor groove DNA polymerase interactions that influence templating (anti-/syn-equilibrium) of 8-oxoG while modulating fidelity.
17125913	Cadmium induces mitogenic signaling in breast cancer cell by an ERalpha-dependent mechanism.	Breast cancer (BC) is linked to estrogen exposure. Estradiol (E2) stimulates BC cells proliferation by binding the estrogen receptor (ER). Hormone-related cancers have been linked to estrogenic environmental contaminants. Cadmium (Cd) a toxic pollutant, acts as estrogens in BC cells. Purpose of our study was to evaluate whether Cd regulates MCF-7 cell proliferation by activating ERK1/2, Akt and PDGFRalpha kinases. Cd increased cell proliferation and the ER-antagonist ICI 182,780 blunted it. To characterize an ER-dependent mechanism, ERalpha/beta expression was evaluated. Cd decreased ERalpha expression, but not ERbeta. Cd also increased ERK1/2, Akt and PDGFRalpha phosphorylation while ICI blocked it. Since stimulation of phosphorylation was slower than expected, c-fos and c-jun proto-oncogenes, and PDGFA were analyzed. Cd rapidly increased c-jun, c-fos and PDGFA expression. Cells were also co-incubated with the Cd and specific kinases inhibitors, which blocked the Cd-stimulated proliferation. In conclusion, our results indicate that Cd increases BC cell proliferation in vitro by stimulating Akt, ERK1/2 and PDGFRalpha kinases activity likely by activating c-fos, c-jun and PDGFA by an ERalpha-dependent mechanism.
3124610	Interleukin 2 toxin: a step toward selective immunomodulation.	We have used protein engineering and recombinant DNA methodologies to genetically replace the eukaryotic cell receptor binding domain of diphtheria toxin with interleukin 2 (IL-2). The toxin-related T cell growth factor fusion gene has been cloned in Escherichia coli K12. Recombinant strains of E coli produce a 68,086 K hybrid toxin, IL-2 toxin that retains immunologic properties intrinsic to both its diphtheria toxin and IL-2 components. IL-2 toxin has been found to selectively inhibit protein synthesis in both human and murine T cell lines that bear high affinity IL-2 receptors, whereas the hybrid toxin is not active against cells that do not bear this receptor. The cytotoxic action of IL-2 toxin is specifically blocked by free IL-2 and monoclonal antibodies that bind to the p55 (Tac antigen) subunit of the high affinity IL-2 receptor. In addition, IL-2 toxin, like diphtheria toxin itself, must pass through an acidic compartment in order to deliver its adenosine diphosphate ribosyl transferase activity to the cytosol of target T cells. In a murine delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) model system, we have shown that IL-2 toxin treatment induces a marked immunosuppression.
23455312	Cerebrovascular Dilation via Selective Targeting of the Cholane Steroid-Recognition Site in the BK Channel β1-Subunit by a Novel Nonsteroidal Agent.	The Ca(2+)/voltage-gated K(+) large conductance (BK) channel β1 subunit is particularly abundant in vascular smooth muscle. By determining their phenotype, BK β1 allows the BK channels to reduce myogenic tone, facilitating vasodilation. The endogenous steroid lithocholic acid (LCA) dilates cerebral arteries via BK channel activation, which requires recognition by a BK β1 site that includes Thr169. Whether exogenous nonsteroidal agents can access this site to selectively activate β1-containing BK channels and evoke vasodilation remain unknown. We performed a chemical structure database similarity search using LCA as a template, along with a two-step reaction to generate sodium 3-hydroxyolean-12-en-30-oate (HENA). HENA activated the BK (cbv1 + β1) channels cloned from rat cerebral artery myocytes with a potency (EC50 = 53 μM) similar to and an efficacy (×2.5 potentiation) significantly greater than that of LCA. This HENA action was replicated on native channels in rat cerebral artery myocytes. HENA failed to activate the channels made of cbv1 + β2, β3, β4, or β1T169A, indicating that this drug selectively targets β1-containing BK channels via the BK β1 steroid-sensing site. HENA (3-45 μM) dilated the rat and C57BL/6 mouse pressurized cerebral arteries. Consistent with the electrophysiologic results, this effect was larger than that of LCA. HENA failed to dilate the arteries from the KCNMB1 knockout mouse, underscoring BK β1's role in HENA action. Finally, carotid artery-infusion of HENA (45 μM) dilated the pial cerebral arterioles via selective BK-channel targeting. In conclusion, we have identified for the first time a nonsteroidal agent that selectively activates β1-containing BK channels by targeting the steroid-sensing site in BK β1, rendering vasodilation.
17202666	A novel vasopressin dual V1A/V2 receptor antagonist, conivaptan hydrochloride, improves hyponatremia in rats with syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH).	We investigated the effects of intravenous administration of conivaptan hydrochloride, a dual vasopressin V1A and V2 receptor antagonist, on blood electrolytes and plasma osmolality in rats with an experimental syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). The experimental SIADH rat model was developed by means of continuous administration of arginine vasopressin (AVP) via a subcutaneously implanted osmotic mini pump, and hyponatremia was induced by additional water loading. This model possesses similar characteristics to those observed in patients with SIADH, specifically decreases in blood sodium concentration and plasma osmolality. In this experimental model, intravenous administration of conivaptan (0.1, 1 mg/kg) significantly increased blood sodium concentration and plasma osmolality. On the other hand, intravenous administration of furosemide (10 mg/kg) did not increase either blood sodium concentration or plasma osmolality in the SIADH rats. Moreover, furosemide significantly lowered blood potassium concentration. These results show that conivaptan improves hyponatremia in rats with SIADH, supporting the therapeutic potential of conivaptan in treatment of patients with hyponatremia associated with SIADH.
10353334	Hyperammonemia: regulation of argininosuccinate synthetase and argininosuccinate lyase genes in aggregating cell cultures of fetal rat brain.	Hyperammonemia in the brain leads to poorly understood alterations of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis. Arginine, the substrate of nitric oxide synthases, might be recycled from the citrulline produced with NO by argininosuccinate synthetase (AS) and argininosuccinate lyase (AL). The regulation of AS and AL genes during hyperammonemia is unknown in the brain. We used brain cell aggregates cultured from dissociated telencephalic cortex of rat embryos to analyze the regulation of AS and AL genes in hyperammonemia. Using RNase protection assay and non-radioactive in situ hybridization on aggregate cryosections, we show that both AS and AL genes are induced in astrocytes but not in neurons of aggregates exposed to 5 mM NH4Cl. Our work suggests that the hyperammonemic brain might increase its recycling of citrulline to arginine.
2453744	Acute and long-term effects of acebutolol on systemic and renal hemodynamics, body fluid volumes, catecholamines, active renin, aldosterone, and lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptor density.	Acebutolol is a relatively new beta-adrenoceptor blocking antagonist, possessing both beta 1-adrenoceptor selectivity and partial agonist activity (PAA). Its acute (24 h, 400 mg, twice daily) and long-term effects (3 weeks) on systemic and renal hemodynamics, body fluid volumes, hormones, and beta-adrenoceptor density on lymphocytes were studied in a single-blind placebo-controlled trial, in 10 hypertensive patients. The initial response to acebutolol (1-2 h) was a fall in heart rate (HR) (-9.6 +/- 2.7%), cardiac output (-16.0 +/- 3%), and stroke volume (SV) (-10.7 +/- 0.2%), and an increase in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) (18.0 +/- 3.9%). Mean arterial pressure (MAP) began to fall 2-3 h after dosing in parallel with a decrease in SVR. At the end of the acute study, MAP and SVR were decreased by 18.1 +/- 2.7% and 15.6 +/- 5.6%, respectively. By that time, HR and SV had returned to control values despite blockade of beta-adrenoceptors. After 3 weeks of treatment (mean dose of acebutolol 480 mg twice daily), the fall in MAP was 10.1 +/- 2.7% and HR was decreased by 13.0 +/- 2.3%. Renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate did not change. Acute and long-term treatment had no effect on the density of lymphocyte-membrane beta-adrenoceptors. This could be explained by acebutolol's beta 1 selectivity or, alternatively, this could be due to the drug's PAA.
23246469	Non-ionic Gd-based MRI contrast agents are optimal for encapsulation into phosphatidyldiglycerol-based thermosensitive liposomes.	Thermosensitive liposomes (TSL) with encapsulated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) longitudinal relaxation time (T(1)) contrast agents (CAs) have been proposed for MRI assisted interventional thermotherapy in solid tumors. Here the feasibility of 6 clinically approved CAs (Gd-DTPA, Gd-BOPTA, Gd-DOTA, Gd-BT-DO3A, Gd-DTPA-BMA, and Gd-HP-DO3A) for formulation into TSL was investigated. CAs were passively encapsulated with 323 mOs kg(-1) into 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine/1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine/1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphodiglycerol 50/20/30 (mol/mol) TSL (DPPG(2)-TSL) to obtain stable formulations. T(1) relaxivity (r(1)) and diffusive permeability to water (P(d)) across the membrane were determined. Shelf life at 4°C was investigated by determining lysolipid content up to 10 weeks after preparation. All preparations were monodispersed with comparable small vesicle sizes (~135 nm). Neither zeta potential nor phase transition temperature (T(m)) was affected by the CA. The formulations showed an increase in r(1) in the temperature range between 38 and 44°C. This correlated with the phase transition. Change in r(1) (Δr(1)=r(1)(45.3°C)-r(1)(37.6°C)) and r(1) (T<T(m)) depended on the encapsulated CA concentration. P(d) at T≤37.6°C was lower for DPPG(2)-TSL encapsulating non-ionic Gd-BT-DO3A, Gd-DTPA-BMA, and Gd-HP-DO3A. All CAs except Gd-DTPA-BMA induced phospholipid hydrolysis, which resulted in unwanted CA leakage. The serum proteins HSA and IgG both contributed to the increase of MRI signal at 30°C by increasing P(d). A high concentration of encapsulated CA is a prerequisite to achieve a sufficiently high Δr(1) during heat triggered CA release combined with a low r(1) at 37°C. Hence, the optimal CA is characterized by a non-ionic structure and a low contribution to osmolality.
23103563	Ibandronate increases the expression of the pro-apoptotic gene FAS by epigenetic mechanisms in tumor cells.	There is growing evidence that aminobisphosphonates like ibandronate show anticancer activity by an unknown mechanism. Biochemically, they prevent posttranslational isoprenylation of small GTPases, thus inhibiting their activity. In tumor cells, activated RAS-GTPase, the founding member of the gene family, down-regulates the expression of the pro-apoptotic gene FAS via epigenetic DNA-methylation by DNMT1. We compared ibandronate treatment in neoplastic human U-2 osteosarcoma and in mouse CCL-51 breast cancer cells as well as in the immortalized non-neoplastic MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells. Ibandronate attenuated cell proliferation in all cell lines tested. In the neoplastic cells we found up-regulation of caspases suggesting apoptosis. Further we found stimulation of FAS-expression as a result of epigenetic DNA demethylation that was due to down-regulation of DNMT1, which was rescued by re-isoprenylation by both geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate and farnesylpyrophosphate. In contrast, ibandronate did not affect FAS and DNMT1 expression in MC3T3-E1 non-neoplastic cells. Data suggest that bisphosphonates via modulation of the activity of small-GTPases induce apoptosis in neoplastic cells by DNA-CpG-demethylation and stimulation of FAS-expression. In conclusion the shown epigenetic mechanism underlying the anti-neoplastic activity of farnesyl-transferase-inhibition, also explains the clinical success of other drugs, which target this pathway.
7739347	Opioid receptor interaction and adenylyl cyclase inhibition of dihydroetorphine: direct comparison with etorphine.	To find out the reason of weak addiction property of dihydroetorphine, we compared the affinities of dihydroetorphine to the type selective opioid receptor and inhibition effect on the adenylyl cyclase activity with those of etorphine. Dihydroetorphine and etorphine have almost the same binding affinities to all types (mu, delta, and kappa) of opioid receptors and antagonist binding sites, and have similar inhibition activities to forskolin stimulated adenylyl cyclase. However, dihydroetorphine showed significantly smaller value of DTNB-index compared with that of etorphine. This differentiation may explain partly the high analgesic with low dependence properties of dihydroetorphine.
23616376	Flexible Low-Voltage Organic Transistors with High Thermal Stability at 250 °C.	Low-operating-voltage flexible organic thin-film transistors with high thermal stability using DPh-DNTT and SAM gate dielectrics are reported. The mobility of the transistors are decreased by 23% after heating to 250 °C for 30 min. Furthermore, flexible organic pseudo-CMOS inverter circuits, which are functional after heating to 200 °C.
23604722	Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced dysfunction of blood-brain barrier.	Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), a glycolytic intermediate, has neuroprotective effects in various brain injury models. However, its effects on blood-brain barrier (BBB) are largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of FBP on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BBB dysfunction in in vitro BBB model comprising co-culture of mouse brain endothelial cell line, bEnd.3 and mouse primary astrocyte and explored its action mechanism therein involved. LPS induced the impairment of endothelial permeability and transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER). The functional changes were confirmed by alterations in immunostaining for junctional proteins occludin, ZO-1 and VE-cadherin, such as the loss of cortical staining pattern and appearance of intercellular gaps in endothelial cells. Co-administration of FBP alleviated the deleterious effects of LPS on BBB permeability and TEER in a dose dependent manner. And also FBP inhibited the LPS-induced changes in the distribution of endothelial junctional proteins, resulting in the better preservation of monolayer integrity. FBP suppressed the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) but did not affect cyclooxygenase-2 expression and prostaglandin E2 production in endothelial cells stimulated with LPS. Taken together, these data suggest that FBP could ameliorate LPS-induced BBB dysfunction through the maintenance of junctional integrity, which might be mediated by downregulation of ROS production.
23122070	Syzygium aqueum leaf extract and its bioactive compounds enhances pre-adipocyte differentiation and 2-NBDG uptake in 3T3-L1 cells.	The insulin-like and/or insulin-sensitising effects of Syzygium aqueum leaf extract and its six bioactive compounds; 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, myricetin-3-O-rhamnoside, europetin-3-O-rhamnoside, phloretin, myrigalone-G and myrigalone-B were investigated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We observed that, S. aqueum leaf extract (0.04-5 μg/ml) and its six bioactive compounds (0.08-10 μM) at non-cytotoxic concentrations were effectively enhance adipogenesis, stimulate glucose uptake and increase adiponectin secretion in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Clearly, the compounds myricetin-3-O-rhamnoside and europetin-3-O-rhamnoside showed insulin-like and insulin-sensitising effects on adipocytes from a concentration of 0.08 μM. These compounds were far better than rosiglitazone and the other isolated compounds in enhancing adipogenesis, stimulating 2-NBDG uptake and increasing adiponectin secretion at all the concentrations tested. These suggest the antidiabetic potential of S. aqueum leaf extract and its six bioactive compounds. However, further molecular interaction studies to explain the mechanisms of action are highly warranted.
17497253	[Short QT syndrome].	Short QT syndrome is a new genetic disorder associated with familial atrial fibrillation and/or sudden death or syncope. To date, different mutations in genes encoding for cardiac ion channels (KCNH2, KCNQ1, and KCNJ2) have been identified to cause the short QT syndrome. The mutations lead to a gain of function of the affected current (IKr, IKs, and IK1). The phenotype is characterized by a shortened QT interval<335 ms after correction for heart rate at rates<80 beats/min. Furthermore, the QT interval poorly adapts to heart rate. Patients exhibit shortened atrial and ventricular effective refractory periods and, in the majority, inducibility of ventricular fibrillation. Death occurs already in newborns. Therapy of choice seems to be the implantable cardioverter defibrillator because of the high incidence of sudden death. Pharmacological treatment has been studied and it could be demonstrated, that some mutant currents may be insufficiently suppressed by drugs targeted to block the specific current such as, e.g., sotalol or ibutilide in patients with a mutation in the IKr-coding gene KCNH2 (HERG). Quinidine proved to be efficient in prolonging the QT interval and normalizing the effective refractory periods in some patients.
18708991	ABCB1 polymorphisms influence steady-state plasma levels of 9-hydroxyrisperidone and risperidone active moiety.	Risperidone is metabolized to its active metabolite, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, mainly by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2D6 and 3A4. Its antipsychotic effect is assumed to be related to the active moiety, that is, the sum of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone. Both risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone are substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a transport protein involved in drug absorption, distribution, and elimination. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of polymorphisms in genes encoding CYP3A5 and P-gp (ABCB1) on the steady-state plasma levels of risperidone, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, and the active moiety, taking CYP2D6 genotype status into account. Forty-six white patients with schizophrenia treated with risperidone (1-10 mg/d) in monotherapy for 4-6 weeks were genotyped, and their plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone were measured. Dose-corrected plasma concentrations (C/D) of risperidone, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, and active moiety showed up to 68-, 9-, and 10-fold interindividual variation, respectively. Six patients carried 1 CYP3A5*1 allele and therefore were likely to express the CYP3A5 enzyme. The CYP3A5 genotype did not influence risperidone, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, or active moiety C/Ds. The CYP2D6 genotype in these 46 patients was again associated with risperidone C/D (P = 0.001) but not with 9-hydroxyrisperidone C/D or active moiety C/D, as previously shown by our group in 37 of these patients. Patients homozygous for the ABCB1 3435T/2677T/1236T haplotype had significantly lower C/Ds of 9-hydroxyrisperidone (P = 0.026) and active moiety (P = 0.028) than patients carrying other ABCB1 genotypes. In conclusion, our results confirmed the significant effect of CYP2D6 genotype on the steady-state plasma levels of risperidone and showed that ABCB1 polymorphisms have a moderate effect on those of 9-hydroxyrisperidone and the active moiety.
23421757	p53-mediated autophagy adjustment is involved in the protection of silibinin against murine dermal inflammation and epidermal apoptosis induced by UVB irradiation.	Apoptosis in murine dermal cells is retarded by ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation-induced autophagic intervention while simultaneously epidermal cells commit apoptosis, during which inflammatory cytokines released from the lost epidermal cells promote immune responses of dermal inflammatory cells, forming morphological symptoms of acute cutaneous diseases. Autophagy is involved in prevention or provocation of apoptosis of dermal or epidermal cells of UVB-irradiated mice via modulation of intracellular metabolism, intervening the balance between cell death and survival in dermis and epidermis. p53 expressed in immune system affects autophagy function through activating or inactivating genes encoding apoptotic factors and inflammatory cytokines. Silibinin protects dermal and epidermal cells of UVB irradiated skin against abnormally autophagy-mediated apoptosis adjustments. In this study, how UVB irradiation intervenes autophagy in dermal and epidermal cells as well as how silibinin protects UVB irradiated skin through physiological recovering of autophagy function in dermis and epidermis are focused and elucidated preliminarily. Silibinin treatment (50 mg/kg/day for 4 days) reversed dermal and epidermal autophagy levels from UVB irradiation-induced improper autophagy intervention, repaired the balance between cell survival and death in dermis and epidermis, and protected skin against damage through mediation of p53 activation in dermal and epidermal cells.
8986981	Characterization of alpha-adrenoceptor activity in the preterm piglet mesentery.	To characterize neonatal mesenteric alpha-adrenoceptor populations, an extracorporeal perfusion circuit was established to control intestinal blood flow in prematurely delivered (by cesarean section at 90% of gestational age) piglets. Activation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors was documented by observing dose-dependent increases in mesenteric perfusion pressure after intramesenteric arterial injection of methoxamine; alpha 2-adrenoceptor activity was confirmed by finding similar increases in mesenteric perfusion pressure after intramesenteric arterial injections of BHT 933. Peripheral intravenous injections of WB 4101 (a competitive alpha 1A-adrenoceptor antagonist), but not clorethylclonidine (CEC, an alpha 1B-adrenoceptor antagonist), significantly blunted (P < .05, ANOVA) the mesenteric vasoconstrictor responses to methoxamine. The mesenteric vasoconstrictor response to BHT 933 (an alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist) also was blunted by WB 4101, but not by CEC. These data suggest that alpha 1A- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors can be activated in the small intestinal mesentery of piglets well before they reach full-term maturation, although receptor specificity has not been fully established.
23265474	Comparative formation of 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) in creatinine/phenylalanine and creatinine/phenylalanine/4-oxo-2-nonenal reaction mixtures.	The comparative formation of the heterocyclic aromatic amine 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) in both creatinine/phenylalanine (CRN/Phe) and creatinine/phenylalanine/4-oxo-2-nonenal (CRN/Phe/ON) systems was studied to analyse the ability of lipid-derived reactive carbonyls to promote PhIP formation. Although PhIP was produced to some extent in the CRN/Phe system, the presence of the oxidized lipid increased considerably the amount of PhIP produced. This increase seemed to be a consequence of the decrease in the E(a) of the reaction when the lipid was present, which diminished from 112.9 to 80.9 kJ/mol. On the other hand, the addition of the lipid did not seem to produce PhIP by an alternative mechanism because PhIP was formed analogously in both CRN/Phe and CRN/Phe/ON systems as a function of pH, creatinine concentration, phenylalanine concentration, time, temperature, oxygen concentration in the reaction atmosphere, and the addition of different amounts of ammonia. All these results suggest that the ability of lipid oxidation products to produce PhIP is related to their capacity to induce the Strecker degradation of phenylalanine to phenylacetaldehyde. Therefore, any other reactive carbonyl compound that can produce the Strecker degradation of phenylalanine should also be considered as a potential inducer of PhIP formation under appropriate conditions.
10531013	Caffeine inhibits the checkpoint kinase ATM.	The basis of many anti-cancer therapies is the use of genotoxic agents that damage DNA and thus kill dividing cells. Agents that cause cells to override the DNA-damage checkpoint are predicted to sensitize cells to killing by genotoxic agents. They have therefore been sought as adjuncts in radiation therapy and chemotherapy. One such compound, caffeine, uncouples cell-cycle progression from the replication and repair of DNA [1] [2]. Caffeine therefore servers as a model compound in establishing the principle that agents that override DNA-damage checkpoints can be used to sensitize cells to the killing effects of genotoxic drugs [3]. But despite more than 20 years of use, the molecular mechanisms by which caffeine affects the cell cycle and checkpoint responses have not been identified. We investigated the effects of caffeine on the G2/M DNA-damage checkpoint in human cells. We report that the radiation-induced activation of the kinase Cds1 [4] (also known as Chk2 [5]) is inhibited by caffeine in vivo and that ATM kinase activity is directly inhibited by caffeine in vitro. Inhibition of ATM provides a molecular explanation of the attenuation of DNA-damage checkpoint responses and for the increased radiosensitivity of caffeine-treated cells [6] [7] [8].
23116938	Endocrine disruptive potential of endosulfan on the reproductive axis of Cichlasoma dimerus (Perciformes, Cichlidae).	Endosulfan (ES), a persistent organochlorine pesticide, is widely used despite its toxicity to non-target animals. Upon reaching water bodies, ES can cause negative effects on aquatic animals, including disruption of hormonal systems. However, the action of ES on fish reproductive axis has been hardly studied thus far. The aim of the present work was to assess the endocrine disruptive potential of endosulfan on the pituitary gonadotropins levels and on the testes function due to ES in the South American freshwater fish Cichlasoma dimerus, using in vitro and in vivo approaches. In vitro experiments showed that ES inhibited the LH-stimulated steroidogenesis in gonads; no change was observed in gonadotropins release from pituitaries in culture. Laboratory waterborne ES (0.1, 0.3 and 1 μg/L) exposure for two months caused decrease in βFSH pituitary content and γGT activity in the testes (Sertoli cell function marker). Testicular histology revealed pathologies such as scarce intermediate stages of spermatogenesis, release of immature germ cells into the lobular lumen, presence of foam cells and interstitial fibrosis. As FSH and FSH-mediated steroidogenesis regulate spermatogenesis and Sertoli cell function, the effect of ES on FSH could be responsible for the morphological alterations observed in testes. In vitro, ES disrupted steroidogenesis in gonads, therefore similar effects in vivo cannot be ruled out. Based on this evidence, ES exhibits an endocrine disruptive action on the reproductive axis of C. dimerus, causing disruption at the pituitary and/or at the gonad level. These effects could acquire ecological significance under prolonged exposure to the pesticide in nature.
23639875	Prostaglandin E2 acts via bone marrow macrophages to block PTH-stimulated osteoblast differentiation in vitro.	Intermittent PTH is the major anabolic therapy for osteoporosis while continuous PTH causes bone loss. PTH acts on the osteoblast (OB) lineage to regulate bone resorption and formation. PTH also induces cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), producing prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), that can act on both OBs and osteoclasts (OCs). Because intermittent PTH is more anabolic in Cox-2 knockout (KO) than wild type (WT) mice, we hypothesized COX-2 might contribute to the effects of continuous PTH by suppressing PTH-stimulated differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into OBs. We compared effects of continuous PTH on bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and primary OBs (POBs) from Cox-2 KO mice, mice with deletion of PGE2 receptors (Ptger4 and Ptger2 KO mice), and WT controls. PTH increased OB differentiation in BMSCs only in the absence of COX-2 expression or activity. In the absence of COX-2, PTH stimulated differentiation if added during the first week of culture. In Cox-2 KO BMSCs, PTH-stimulated differentiation was prevented by adding PGE2 to cultures. Co-culture of POBs with M-CSF-expanded bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) showed that the inhibition of PTH-stimulated OB differentiation required not only COX-2 or PGE2 but also BMMs. Sufficient PGE2 to mediate the inhibitory effect was made by either WT POBs or WT BMMs. The inhibitory effect mediated by COX-2/PGE2 was transferred by conditioned media from RANKL-treated BMMs and could be blocked by osteoprotegerin, which interferes with RANKL binding to its receptor on OC lineage cells. Deletion of Ptger4, but not Ptger2, in BMMs prevented the inhibition of PTH-stimulated OB differentiation. As expected, PGE2 also stimulated OB differentiation, but when given in combination with PTH, the stimulatory effects of both were abrogated. These data suggest that PGE2, acting via EP4R on BMMs committed to the OC lineage, stimulated secretion of a factor or factors that acted to suppress PTH-stimulated OB differentiation. This suppression of OB differentiation could contribute to the bone loss seen with continuous PTH in vivo.
15694653	Atypical and typical antipsychotic drug interactions with the dopamine D2 receptor.	A model of the dopamine D2 receptor was used to study the receptor interactions of dopamine, the typical antipsychotics haloperidol and loxapine, and the atypical antipsychotics clozapine and melperone. The atypical antipsychotics interacted with the halogen atom of the ring system in the direction of the transmembrane helices (TMHs) 2, 3 and 7, while the typical had the corresponding halogen atom in the direction of TMH5. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the average helical displacement upon binding increased in the order: typical < atypical < dopamine. Upon binding, the atypical induced larger displacements into TMH5 than did the typical. The typical had stronger non-bonded interactions with the receptor than had the atypical, which is in agreement with the experimental observation that the atypical antipsychotic drugs dissociate faster from the receptor than the typical antipsychotic drugs.
23180341	Chemical constituents from the fungus Amauroderma amoiensis and their in vitro acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities.	One new compound named amauroamoienin (1), together with thirteen known compounds (2-14), was isolated from the EtOAc extract of Amauroderma amoiensis. The structures of these compounds were elucidated by the analysis of 1D and 2D spectroscopic data and the MS technique. The bioassays of inhibitory activities of these isolates against acetylcholinesterase were evaluated, and compounds 1, 3, and 5 exhibited acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities.
16851960	Methyl transfer in glycine N-methyltransferase. A theoretical study.	Density functional theory calculations using the hybrid functional B3LYP have been performed to study the methyl transfer step in glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT). This enzyme catalyzes the S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent methylation of glycine to form sarcosine. The starting point for the calculations is the recent X-ray crystal structure of GNMT complexed with SAM and acetate. Several quantum chemical models with different sizes, employing up to 98 atoms, were used. The calculations demonstrate that the suggested mechanism, where the methyl group is transferred in a single S(N)2 step, is thermodynamically plausible. By adding or eliminating various groups at the active site, it was furthermore demonstrated that hydrogen bonds to the amino group of the glycine substrate lower the reaction barrier, while hydrogen bonds to the carboxylate group raise the barrier.
23198819	Bioinspired and highly oriented clay nanocomposites with a xyloglucan biopolymer matrix: extending the range of mechanical and barrier properties.	"The development of clay bionanocomposites requires processing routes with nanostructural control. Moreover, moisture durability is a concern with water-soluble biopolymers. Here, oriented bionanocomposite coatings with strong in-plane orientation of clay platelets are for the first time prepared by continuous water-based processing. Montmorillonite (MTM) and a ""new"" unmodified biological polymer (xyloglucan (XG)) are combined. The resulting nanocomposites are characterized by FE-SEM, TEM, and XRD. XG adsorption on MTM is measured by quartz crystal microbalance analysis. Mechanical and gas barrier properties are measured, also at high relative humidity. The reinforcement effects are modeled. XG dimensions in composites are estimated using atomistic simulations. The nanostructure shows highly oriented and intercalated clay platelets. The reinforcement efficiency and effects on barrier properties are remarkable and are likely to be due to highly oriented and well-dispersed MTM and strong XG-MTM interactions. Properties are well preserved in humid conditions and the reasons for this are discussed."
23592780	Structural mechanism of ring opening reaction of glucose by human serum albumin.	Glucose reacts with proteins non-enzymatically under physiological conditions. Such glycation is exacerbated in diabetic patients with high level of blood sugar, and induces various complications. Human albumin serum (HSA) is the most abundant protein in plasma and is glycated by glucose. The glycation sites on HSA remain controversial among different studies. Here, we report two protein crystal structures of HSA in complex with either glucose or fructose. These crystal structures reveal that the presence of linear forms of sugar for both monosaccharides. The linear form of glucose forms a covalent bond to Lys195 of HSA, but not the case for fructose. Based on these structures, we propose a mechanism for glucose ring opening involving both residues Lys195 and Lys199. These results provide mechanistic insights to understand the glucose ring opening reaction and the glycation of proteins by monosaccharides.
23313663	Benzo[α]pyrene repressed DNA mismatch repair in human breast cancer cells.	DNA mismatch repair (MMR) has been recently implicated to play a significant role in breast cancer progression, however, few studies have examined how various carcinogens affect MMR system in breast cancer cells. The present study employs an in vivo MMR assay developed in our laboratory to assess how prevalent environmental carcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) affect MMR activity in human breast carcinoma cells. Specifically, we quantitatively measured MMR activity in ZR75-1 cells after they were exposed to benzo[α]pyrene (BaP), a prototypical PAH, at various concentrations. Our findings revealed that BaP exposure at high concentrations of 1 and 5 μM induced significant inhibition of MMR activity in ZR75-1 cells. Further, we also identified that MMR repression induced by 5 μM BaP was mediated through one of the MMR key proteins MSH6 as significant reduction in protein level was detected by western blot. More importantly, ectopic expression of hMSH6 restored MMR activity in the BaP treated cells to the same level as in the control cells. Impaired MMR plays an important role in carcinogenesis. Our findings suggest that BaP induced repression of MMR activity may also contribute to the progression of mutagenesis event. Meanwhile, the present study also for the first demonstrated that our in vivo DNA MMR assay can be applied in the field of environmental toxicology.
12650833	Effects of serine/threonine protein phosphatase inhibitors on morphine-induced antinociception in the tail flick test in mice.	The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of serine/threonine protein phosphatase (PP) inhibitors on morphine-induced antinociception in the tail flick test in mice, and on [3H]naloxone binding to the forebrain crude synaptosome fraction. Neither okadaic acid nor cantharidin (1-10000 nM) displaced [3H]naloxone from its specific binding sites, which indicates that they do not interact at the opioid receptor level. The i.c.v. administration of very low doses of okadaic acid (0.001-1 pg/mouse) and cantharidin (0.001-1 ng/mouse), which inhibit PP2A, produced a dose-dependent antagonism of the antinociception induced by morphine (s.c.). However, L-nor-okadaone (0.001 pg/mouse-1 ng/mouse, i.c.v.), an analogue of okadaic acid lacking activity against protein phosphatases, did not affect the antinociceptive effect of morphine. On the other hand, high doses of okadaic acid (10 ng/mouse, i.c.v.) and cantharidin (1 microg/mouse, i.c.v.), which also block PP1, and calyculin-A (0.1 fg/mouse-1 ng/mouse, i.c.v.), which inhibits equally both PP1 and PP2A, did not modify the morphine-induced antinociception. These results suggest that the activation of type 2A serine/threonine protein phosphatases may play a role in the antinociceptive effect of morphine, and that PP1 might counterbalace this activity.
23261677	Shikonin induces programmed necrosis-like cell death through the formation of receptor interacting protein 1 and 3 complex.	An alternative cell demise programmed necrosis has also been proposed when apoptotic machinery is impaired or blocked during tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) stimulation. Shikonin (SKN), an herbal extract from the Chinese plant, has been reported to induce either apoptosis or necrosis depending on cell types or its concentrations. In this presentation, SKN caused cell death of NIH3T3 in a dose-dependent manner. Intriguingly, SKN-mediated cell death was in part protected by necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), a specific inhibitor of programmed necrosis, but not zVAD a pan-caspase inhibitor. SKN directly mediated cell death via receptor interacting protein1 and 3 (RIP1-RIP3) complex formation, which is required for TNFα-mediated programmed necrosis. Additionally, SKN-caused cell death was reversed by a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) whereas TNFα-mediated necrosis was successfully protected by butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), implying that ROS may be differentially derived from death inducing agents. Concurrently with the protective effect of the ROS scavenger or Nec-1 on TNFα or SKN, the RIP1-RIP3 complex was significantly affected in the presence of those agents. Here, it is highlighted that SKN as well as TNFα can directly mediate cell death via a pronecrotic complex, but ROS were generated via different routes depending on cell death-inducing agents.
23558600	Lixisenatide: first global approval.	The selective once-daily prandial glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist lixisenatide (Lyxumia(®)) is under development with Sanofi for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Lixisenatide belongs to a class of GLP-1 compounds designed to mimic the endogenous hormone GLP-1. Native GLP-1 stimulates insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner, as well as suppressing glucagon production and slowing gastric emptying. A once-daily subcutaneous formulation of lixisenatide has been approved in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Mexico for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, and is under regulatory review in the USA, Switzerland, Brazil, Canada, Ukraine, South Africa, Japan and Australia. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of lixisenatide, leading to this first approval for use in adults with type 2 diabetes.
15078100	Kinetic mechanism of quinone oxidoreductase 2 and its inhibition by the antimalarial quinolines.	Quinone oxidoreductase 2 (QR2) purified from human red blood cells was recently shown to be a potential target of the quinoline antimalarial compounds [Graves et al., (2002) Mol. Pharmacol. 62, 1364]. QR2 catalyzes the two-electron reduction of menadione via the oxidation of N-alkylated or N-ribosylated nicotinamides. To investigate the mechanism and consequences of inhibition of QR2 by the quinolines further, we have used steady-state and transient-state kinetics to define the mechanism of QR2. Importantly, we have shown that QR2 when isolated from an overproducing strain of E. coli is kinetically equivalent to the enzyme from the native human red blood cell source. We observe ping-pong kinetics consistent with one substrate/inhibitor binding site that shows selectivity for the oxidation state of the FAD cofactor, suggesting that selective inhibition of the liver versus red blood cell forms of malaria may be possible. The reductant N-methyldihydronicotinamide and the inhibitor primaquine bind exclusively to the oxidized enzyme. In contrast, the inhibitors quinacrine and chloroquine bind exclusively to the reduced enzyme. The quinone substrate menadione, on the other hand, binds nonspecifically to both forms of the enzyme. Single-turnover kinetics of the reductive half-reaction are chemically and kinetically competent and confirm the inhibitor selectivity seen in the steady-state experiments. Our studies shed light on the possible in vivo potency of the quinolines and provide a foundation for future studies aimed at creating more potent QR2 inhibitors and at understanding the physiological significance of QR2.
23473030	Iron and diabetes risk.	Iron overload is a risk factor for diabetes. The link between iron and diabetes was first recognized in pathologic conditions-hereditary hemochromatosis and thalassemia-but high levels of dietary iron also impart diabetes risk. Iron plays a direct and causal role in diabetes pathogenesis mediated both by β cell failure and insulin resistance. Iron also regulates metabolism in most tissues involved in fuel homeostasis, with the adipocyte in particular serving an iron-sensing role. The underlying molecular mechanisms mediating these effects are numerous and incompletely understood but include oxidant stress and modulation of adipokines and intracellular signal transduction pathways.
17015817	Ramelteon: a novel hypnotic lacking abuse liability and sedative adverse effects.	CONTEXT: Ramelteon is a novel MT1 and MT2 melatonin receptor selective agonist recently approved for insomnia treatment. Most approved insomnia medications have potential for abuse and cause motor and cognitive impairment. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential for abuse, subjective effects, and motor and cognitive-impairing effects of ramelteon compared with triazolam, a classic benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic drug. DESIGN: In this double-blind crossover study, each participant received oral doses of ramelteon (16, 80, or 160 mg), triazolam (0.25, 0.5, or 0.75 mg), and placebo during approximately 18 days. All participants received each treatment on different days. Most outcome measures were assessed at 0.5 hours before drug administration and repeatedly up to 24 hours after drug administration. SETTING: Residential research facility. PARTICIPANTS: Fourteen adults with histories of sedative abuse. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Subject-rated measures included items relevant to potential for abuse (eg, drug liking, street value, and pharmacological classification), as well as assessments of a broad range of stimulant and sedative subjective effects. Observer-rated measures included assessments of sedation and impairment. Motor and cognitive performance measures included psychomotor and memory tasks and a standing balance task. RESULTS: Compared with placebo, ramelteon (16, 80, and 160 mg) showed no significant effect on any of the subjective effect measures, including those related to potential for abuse. In the pharmacological classification, 79% (11/14) of subjects identified the highest dose of ramelteon as placebo. Similarly, compared with placebo, ramelteon had no effect at any dose on any observer-rated or motor and cognitive performance measure. In contrast, triazolam showed dose-related effects on a wide range of subject-rated, observer-rated, and motor and cognitive performance measures, consistent with its profile as a sedative drug with abuse liability. CONCLUSION: Ramelteon demonstrated no significant effects indicative of potential for abuse or motor and cognitive impairment at up to 20 times the recommended therapeutic dose and may represent a useful alternative to existing insomnia medications.
22830954	Effects of clopidogrel and clarithromycin on the disposition of sibutramine and its active metabolites M1 and M2 in relation to CYP2B6*6 polymorphism.	Plasma concentrations of sibutramine and its two active metabolites after single oral dose of sibutramine were determined in Korean healthy male subjects with different CYP2B6 genotypes (CYP2B6*1/*1, *1/*6 and *6/*6), either alone or after four-day pretreatment with clopidogrel or clarithromycin. The pretreatment with clopidogrel and clarithromycin raised the mean area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of sibutramine by 163% and 255%, respectively. Co-administration of clarithromycin, combined with CYP2B6*6/*6 genotype, led to highest concentration of sibutramine. The molar sum AUC (M1 + M2) was raised by 35% in the clopidogrel phase but not significantly affected by clarithromycin or CYP2B6 genotype. The CYP2B6*6/*6 subjects in the clopidogrel phase showed the highest molar AUC (M1 + M2) among three genotype groups throughout the three phases. The exposure of sibutramine and its metabolites seemed to be associated with the CYP2B6 genotype. The treatment of clopidogrel significantly altered the disposition of active metabolites as well as sibutramine, but clarithromycin only affects the disposition of sibutramine. These results suggest that the perturbation of CYP2B6 activity may contribute to the inter-individual variation of sibutramine drug responses although the clinical relevance is remained to be established.
23238103	Age dependent differences in the regulation of hippocampal steroid hormones and receptor genes: relations to motivation and cognition in male rats.	Estrogen and estrogenic functions are age-dependently involved in the modulation of learning, memory and mood in female humans and animals. However, the investigation of estrogenic effects in males has been largely neglected. Therefore, we investigated the hippocampal gene expression of estrogen receptors α and β (ERα, β) in 8-week-old, 12-week-old and 24-week-old male rats. To control for possible interactions between the expression of the estrogen receptor genes and other learning-related steroid receptors, androgen receptors (AR), corticosterone-binding glucocorticoid receptors (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) were also measured. Furthermore, the concentrations of the ligands 17β-estradiol, testosterone and corticosterone were measured. The spatial training was conducted in a hole-board. The 8-week-old rats exhibited higher levels of general activity and exploration during the training and performed best with respect to spatial learning and memory, whereas no difference was found between the 12-week-old and 24-week-old rats. The trained 8-week-old rats exhibited increased gene expression of ERα compared with the untrained rats in this age group as well as the trained 12-week-old and 24-week-old rats. The concentrations of estradiol and testosterone, however, were generally higher in the 24-week-old rats than in the 8-week-old and 12-week-old rats. The ERα mRNA concentrations correlated positively with behavior that indicate general learning motivation. These results suggest a specific role of ERα in the age-related differences in motivation and subsequent success in the task. Thus, estrogen and estrogenic functions may play a more prominent role in young male behavior and development than has been previously assumed.
11689471	Aspirin and salicylate bind to immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BiP) and inhibit its ATPase activity in human fibroblasts.	Salicylic acid (SA), an endogenous signaling molecule of plants, possesses anti-inflammatory and anti-neoplastic actions in human. Its derivative, aspirin, is the most commonly used anti-inflammatory and analgesic drug. Aspirin and sodium salicylate (salicylates) have been reported to have multiple pharmacological actions. However, it is unclear whether they bind to a cellular protein. Here, we report for the first time the purification from human fibroblasts of a approximately 78 kDa salicylate binding protein with sequence identity to immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BiP). The Kd values of SA binding to crude extract and to recombinant BiP were 45.2 and 54.6 microM, respectively. BiP is a chaperone protein containing a polypeptide binding site recognizing specific heptapeptide sequence and an ATP binding site. A heptapeptide with the specific sequence displaced SA binding in a concentration-dependent manner whereas a control heptapeptide did not. Salicylates inhibited ATPase activity stimulated by this specific heptapeptide but did not block ATP binding or induce BiP expression. These results indicate that salicylates bind specifically to the polypeptide binding site of BiP in human cells that may interfere with folding and transport of proteins important in inflammation.
17550897	The calponin homology domain of Vav1 associates with calmodulin and is prerequisite to T cell antigen receptor-induced calcium release in Jurkat T lymphocytes.	Vav1 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that is expressed specifically in hematopoietic cells and plays important roles in T cell development and activation. Vav1 consists of multiple structural domains so as to facilitate both its guanine nucleotide exchange activity and scaffold function following T cell antigen receptor (TCR) engagement. Previous studies demonstrated that the calponin homology (CH) domain of Vav1 is required for TCR-stimulated calcium mobilization and thus downstream activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells. However, it remained obscure how Vav1 functions in regulating calcium flux. In an effort to explore molecules interacting with Vav1, we found that calmodulin bound to Vav1 in a calcium-dependent and TCR activation-independent manner. The binding site was mapped to the CH domain of Vav1. Reconstitution of vav1-null Jurkat T cells (J.Vav1) with CH-deleted Vav1 exhibited a severe deficiency in calcium release to the same extent as that of Jurkat cells treated with the calmodulin inhibitor or J.Vav1 cells. The defect persisted even when phospholipase-Cgamma1 was fully activated, indicating a prerequisite role of Vav1 CH domain in calcium signaling. The results suggest that Vav1 and calmodulin function cooperatively to potentiate TCR-induced calcium release. This study unveiled a mechanism by which the Vav1 CH domain is involved in calcium signaling and provides insight into our understanding of the role of Vav1 in T cell activation.
23296101	Lack of transient receptor potential melastatin 8 activation by phthalate esters that enhance contact hypersensitivity in mice.	We studied the involvement of sensory neurons in skin sensitization to allergens using a mouse model in which the T-helper type 2 response is essential. Skin sensitization to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) has been shown to be enhanced by several phthalate esters, including dibutyl phthalate (DBP). For different types of phthalate esters, we found a correlation between the ability of transient receptor potential (TRP) A1 activation and that of enhancing skin sensitization. A TRPA1-specific antagonist, HC-030031, was shown to suppress skin sensitization in the presence of DBP. However, since phthalate esters also activate TRPV1, phthalate esters could activate other types of TRP channels non-selectively. Furthermore, sensitization to FITC is also enhanced by menthol, which activates TRPA1 and TRPM8. Here we established an in vitro system for measuring TRPM8 activation. The selectivity for TRPM8 was established by the fact that two TRPM8 agonists (menthol and icilin) induced calcium mobilization, whereas agonists of TRPA1 and TRPV1 did not. We demonstrated that phthalate esters do not activate TRPM8. TRPA1-antagonist HC-030031 did not inhibit TRPM8 activation induced by menthol or icilin. These results show that phthalate esters activate TRPA1 and TRPV1 with selectivity. TRPM8 activation is not likely to be involved in the sensitization to FITC.
23396090	Overcoming chemotherapy resistance of ovarian cancer cells by liposomal cisplatin: molecular mechanisms unveiled by gene expression profiling.	Previously we reported that liposomal cisplatin (CDDP) overcomes CDDP resistance of ovarian A2780cis cancer cells (Krieger et al., Int. J. Pharm. 389, 2010, 10-17). Here we find that the cytotoxic activity of liposomal CDDP is not associated with detectable DNA platination in resistant ovarian cancer cells. This suggests that the mode of action of liposomal CDDP is different from the free drug. To gain insight into mechanisms of liposomal CDDP activity, we performed a transcriptome analysis of untreated A2780cis cells, and A2780cis cells in response to exposure with IC50 values of free or liposomal CDDP. A process network analysis of upregulated genes showed that liposomal CDDP induced a highly different gene expression profile in comparison to the free drug. p53 was identified as a key player directing transcriptional responses to free or liposomal CDDP. The free drug induced expression of essential genes of the intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptosis pathway (BAX, BID, CASP9) most likely through p38MAPK activation. In contrast, liposomal CDDP induced expression of genes from DNA damage pathways and several genes of the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis (TNFRSF10B-DR5, CD70-TNFSF7). It thus appears that liposomal CDDP overcomes CDDP resistance by inducing DNA damage and in consequence programmed cell death by the extrinsic pathway. Predictions from gene expression data with respect to apoptosis activation were confirmed at the protein level by an apoptosis antibody array. This sheds new light on liposomal drug carrier approaches in cancer and suggests liposomal CDDP as promising strategy for the treatment of CDDP resistant ovarian carcinomas.
2484931	Evaluation of vitamin K3 feed additive for prevention of sweet clover disease.	Sweet clover poisoning in cattle is caused by an anticoagulant (dicumarol) that is formed in moldy sweet clover hay. Previous experiments with vitamin K3 and vitamin K1 in therapy trials indicated that vitamin K1 was effective in reducing prothrombin times but vitamin K3 was not. As a possible alternative in the use of toxic sweet clover hays, vitamin K3 was evaluated to see if it would prevent hemorrhagic crises when fed to cattle consuming toxic sweet clover hay. Vitamin K3 levels of 0, 0.45, 4.5, 11, and 45 mg/kg body weight/day were fed to 173-235-kg steers consuming toxic (40-50 ppm dicumarol) sweet clover. The 45-mg K3/kg/day supplement was not palatable and had to be discontinued. The 0.45, 4.5, and 11-mg K3/kg/day supplements did not significantly reduce the prothrombin times as compared to the 0-mg K3/kg/day group.
23159479	The impact of oxytocin administration and maternal love withdrawal on event-related potential (ERP) responses to emotional faces with performance feedback.	This is the first experimental study on the effect of oxytocin administration on the neural processing of facial stimuli conducted with female participants that uses event-related potentials (ERPs). Using a double-blind, placebo-controlled within-subjects design, we studied the effects of 16 IU of intranasal oxytocin on ERPs to pictures combining performance feedback with emotional facial expressions in 48 female undergraduate students. Participants also reported on the amount of love withdrawal they experienced from their mothers. Vertex positive potential (VPP) and late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes were more positive after oxytocin compared to placebo administration. This suggests that oxytocin increased attention to the feedback stimuli (LPP) and enhanced the processing of emotional faces (VPP). Oxytocin heightened processing of the happy and disgusted faces primarily for those reporting less love withdrawal. Significant associations with LPP amplitude suggest that more maternal love withdrawal relates to the allocation of attention toward the motivationally relevant combination of negative feedback with a disgusted face.
23266452	N-acetylgalactosamine functionalized mixed micellar nanoparticles for targeted delivery of siRNA to liver.	Due to its efficient and specific gene silencing ability, RNA interference has shown great potential in the treatment of liver diseases. However, achieving in vivo delivery of siRNA to critical liver cells remains the biggest obstacle for this technique to be a real clinic therapeutic modality. Here, we describe a promising liver targeting siRNA delivery system based on N-acetylgalactosamine functionalized mixed micellar nanoparticles (Gal-MNP), which can efficiently deliver siRNA to hepatocytes and silence the target gene expression after systemic administration. The Gal-MNP were assembled in aqueous solution from mixed N-acetylgalactosamine functionalized poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(ε-caprolactone) and cationic poly(ε-caprolactone)-b-poly(2-aminoethyl ethylene phosphate) (PCL-b-PPEEA); the properties of nanoparticles, including particle size, zeta potential and the density of poly(ethylene glycol) could be easily regulated. The hepatocyte-targeting effect of Gal-MNP was demonstrated by significant enriching of fluorescent siRNA in primary hepatocytes in vitro and in vivo. Successful down-regulation of liver-specific apolipoprotein B (apoB) expression was achieved in mouse liver, at both the transcriptional and protein level, following intravenous injection of Gal-MNP/siapoB to BALB/c mice. Systemic delivery of Gal-MNP/siRNA did not induce the innate immune response or positive hepatotoxicity. The results of this study suggested therapeutic potential for the Gal-MNP/siRNA system in liver disease.
14722255	The antileukemia drug 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine: an intrinsic transcriptional antagonist.	The nucleoside analog 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (CldAdo; cladribine) is effective in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. CldAdo is phosphorylated and incorporated into cellular DNA but is not an absolute chain terminator. We demonstrated by in vitro gel-shift assays that binding interactions of the human TATA box-binding protein (TBP) were disrupted on 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine monophosphate (CldAMP)-substituted TATA box consensus sequences. We hypothesized that human RNA polymerase II (pol II) transcriptional processes would therefore be affected by 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine triphosphate (CldATP) incorporation into a promoter TATA element. Double-stranded DNA templates containing the adenovirus major late promoter and coding sequences were enzymatically synthesized as control or with site-specific CldAMP residues, incubated with HeLa extract, and the synthesis of radiolabeled 44-base transcripts was assessed. With increasing amounts of HeLa extract, CldAMP substitution for dAMP within the TATA box decreased in vitro pol II transcription by approximately 35% compared with control substrates. Time-course studies showed that transcript production increased in a linear fashion on control substrates. In contrast, transcription on CldAMP-substituted TATA sequences reached a plateau after 20 min. Furthermore, CldAMP-substituted promoter sequences trapped or sequestered TBP, preventing its dissociation from DNA and subsequent binding to additional TATA elements to reinitiate transcription. CldAdo thus represents the first example of a nucleoside analog that acts as a transcriptional antagonist. CldATP incorporation into gene regulatory sequences may provide a novel strategy to modulate specific protein/DNA interactions.
21318872	Use of (Gyro) Gy and spermine synthase transgenic mice to study functions of spermine.	The polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and spermine are essential for mammalian cell growth, -differentiation, and cell death and have important physiological roles in all tissues. Many of the properties of polyamines that can be demonstrated in vitro are common to all three molecules with differences only in potency. Loss of any of the enzymes needed to make either putrescine or spermidine (which also -prevent the production of spermine) is lethal, but male mice lacking spermine synthase (SpmS) due to a deletion of part of the X chromosome are viable on the B6C3H background. These mice are termed Gyro (Gy) due to their circling behavior. They have a variety of abnormalities including deafness, neurological problems, small size, and a tendency to early death. They can therefore be used to evaluate the physiological function(s) uniquely provided by spermine. They also provide a potential animal model for Snyder-Robinson syndrome (SRS), a rare human inherited disease due to a loss of SpmS activity. An essential control in experiments using Gy mice is to demonstrate that the abnormal phenotypes exhibited by these mice are abolished by providing replacement spermine and this can be accomplished by breeding with CAG-SMS mice that express SpmS from a ubiquitous promoter. Techniques for identifying, characterizing, and using these mouse strains and limitations of this approach are described in this chapter.
23387288	Cytotoxic activity of Guettarda pohliana Müll. Arg. (Rubiaceae).	The cytotoxic activity of crude extracts and their fractions from leaves and roots of G. pohliana was assessed against nine human cancer cell lines: melanoma (UACC-62), breast (MCF-7), breast expressing the multidrug resistance phenotype (NCI-ADR), lung (NCI-460), prostate (PCO-3), kidney (786-0), ovarian (OVCAR), colon (HT-29) and leukaemia (K-562). The hexane fraction from leaves (HL) and ethyl acetate (EAR), chloroform (CR) and hydromethanolic (HMR) fractions from roots were the most active fractions against K-562 with GI(50) values being lower than 1 μg mL(- 1). Also, CR and HMR fractions were active against UACC-62 cell line in the same order of magnitude. The phytochemical study of the CR fraction allowed identifying the known iridoids secoxyloganin, sweroside and loganin.
16765071	Detection of 6-nitrotryptophan in proteins by Western blot analysis and its application for peroxynitrite-treated PC12 cells.	We have previously reported on the formation of 6-nitrotryptophan by the reaction of reactive nitrogen species with a tryptophan residue in human Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) (F. Yamakura et al., J. Biochem. 138 (2005) 57-69). Here, we report on the preparation of anti-6-nitrotryptophan antiserum by using synthesized 6-nitrotryptophan-conjugated keyhole limpet hemocyanin as an antigen and the purification of the antibody by using a 6-nitrotryptophan-conjugated affinity column. The purified antibody was immunoreactive with 6-nitrotryptophan residue containing Cu, Zn-SOD but not immunoreactive with Cu, Zn-SOD, Mn-SOD, bovine serum albumin, and 3-nitrotyrosine residue containing Mn-SOD. Nitro group of 6-nitrotryptophan was reduced by sodium hydrosulfite to form 6-aminotryptophan as a major product. The reduced 6-nitrotryptophan residues lost its immunoreactivity with the antibody. We detected different immunoreactive bands between using antibody for 6-nitrotryptophan residues and that for 3-nitrotyrosine residues in crude extracts of neuron-like PC12 cells treated with peroxynitrite by a Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed nine intensively stained immunoreactive spots for 6-nitrotryptophan residues in the peroxynitrite-treated PC12 cells, which were subjected to trypsin digestion and LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis. We identified M2 pyruvate kinase, elongation factor 2, mitochondrial aconitase, pyruvate carboxylase, and heat shock protein HSP90alpha as candidates for 6-nitrotryptophan residues containing proteins, with peptide coverage over 10%, in crude extracts of peroxynitrite-treated PC12 cells.
23371303	Ceftazidime-avibactam: a novel cephalosporin/β-lactamase inhibitor combination.	Avibactam (formerly NXL104, AVE1330A) is a synthetic non-β-lactam, β-lactamase inhibitor that inhibits the activities of Ambler class A and C β-lactamases and some Ambler class D enzymes. This review summarizes the existing data published for ceftazidime-avibactam, including relevant chemistry, mechanisms of action and resistance, microbiology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy and safety data from animal and human trials. Although not a β-lactam, the chemical structure of avibactam closely resembles portions of the cephem bicyclic ring system, and avibactam has been shown to bond covalently to β-lactamases. Very little is known about the potential for avibactam to select for resistance. The addition of avibactam greatly (4-1024-fold minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] reduction) improves the activity of ceftazidime versus most species of Enterobacteriaceae depending on the presence or absence of β-lactamase enzyme(s). Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the addition of avibactam also improves the activity of ceftazidime (~fourfold MIC reduction). Limited data suggest that the addition of avibactam does not improve the activity of ceftazidime versus Acinetobacter species or most anaerobic bacteria (exceptions: Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Prevotella spp. and Porphyromonas spp.). The pharmacokinetics of avibactam follow a two-compartment model and do not appear to be altered by the co-administration of ceftazidime. The maximum plasma drug concentration (C(max)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of avibactam increase linearly with doses ranging from 50 mg to 2,000 mg. The mean volume of distribution and half-life of 22 L (~0.3 L/kg) and ~2 hours, respectively, are similar to ceftazidime. Like ceftazidime, avibactam is primarily renally excreted, and clearance correlates with creatinine clearance. Pharmacodynamic data suggest that ceftazidime-avibactam is rapidly bactericidal versus β-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacilli that are not inhibited by ceftazidime alone.Clinical trials to date have reported that ceftazidime-avibactam is as effective as standard carbapenem therapy in complicated intra-abdominal infection and complicated urinary tract infection, including infection caused by cephalosporin-resistant Gram-negative isolates. The safety and tolerability of ceftazidime-avibactam has been reported in three phase I pharmacokinetic studies and two phase II clinical studies. Ceftazidime-avibactam appears to be well tolerated in healthy subjects and hospitalized patients, with few serious drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events reported to date.In conclusion, avibactam serves to broaden the spectrum of ceftazidime versus ß-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacilli. The exact roles for ceftazidime-avibactam will be defined by efficacy and safety data from further clinical trials. Potential future roles for ceftazidime-avibactam include the treatment of suspected or documented infections caused by resistant Gram-negative-bacilli producing extended-spectrum ß-lactamase (ESBL), Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPCs) and/or AmpC ß-lactamases. In addition, ceftazidime-avibactam may be used in combination (with metronidazole) for suspected polymicrobial infections. Finally, the increased activity of ceftazidime-avibactam versus P. aeruginosa may be of clinical benefit in patients with suspected or documented P. aeruginosa infections.
23395804	Prolactin regulates transcription of the ion uptake Na+/Cl- cotransporter (ncc) gene in zebrafish gill.	Prolactin (PRL) is a well-known regulator of ion and water transport within osmoregulatory tissues across vertebrate species, yet how PRL acts on some of its target tissues remains poorly understood. Using zebrafish as a model, we show that ionocytes in the gill directly respond to systemic PRL to regulate mechanisms of ion uptake. Ion-poor conditions led to increases in the expression of PRL receptor (prlra), Na(+)/Cl(-) cotransporter (ncc; slc12a10.2), Na(+)/H(+) exchanger (nhe3b; slc9a3.2), and epithelial Ca(2+) channel (ecac; trpv6) transcripts within the gill. Intraperitoneal injection of ovine PRL (oPRL) increased ncc and prlra transcripts, but did not affect nhe3b or ecac. Consistent with direct PRL action in the gill, addition of oPRL to cultured gill filaments stimulated ncc in a concentration-dependent manner, an effect blocked by a pure human PRL receptor antagonist (Δ1-9-G129R-hPRL). These results suggest that PRL signaling through PRL receptors in the gill regulates the expression of ncc, thereby linking this pituitary hormone with an effector of Cl(-) uptake in zebrafish for the first time.
8882618	Interactions of 2,3-benzodiazepines and cyclothiazide at AMPA receptors: patch clamp recordings in cultured neurones and area CA1 in hippocampal slices.	1. The 2,3-benzodiazepines GYKI 52466, GYKI 53405 and GYKI 53655 antagonized AMPA-induced currents in cultured superior colliculus neurones in a non use-dependent manner (steady state IC50s: GYKI 52466 9.8 +/- 0.6 microM; GYKI 53405 3.1 +/- 0.6 microM; GYKI 53655 0.8 +/- 0.1 microM). 2. Higher concentrations of all three antagonists slowed the onset kinetics and quickened the offset kinetics of AMPA-induced currents indicative of an allosteric interaction with the AMPA recognition site. 3. Cyclothiazide (3-300 microM) dramatically slowed desensitization of AMPA-induced currents and potentiated steady state currents (EC50 10.0 +/- 2.5 microM) to a much greater degree than peak currents. Both tau on and tau off were also increased by cyclothiazide in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50: tau on 42.1 +/- 4.5 microM; tau off 31.6 +/- 6.6 microM). 4. Cyclothiazide (10-100 microM) shifted the concentration-response curves of the 2,3-benzodiazepines to the right. For example, with 10 microM cyclothiazide the IC50s of GYKI 52466 and GYKI 53405 on steady-state AMPA-induced currents were 57.9 +/- 9.5 and 41.6 +/- 1.5 microM, respectively. 5. GYKI 53405 and GYKI 52466 concentration-dependently reversed the effects of cyclothiazide (100 microM) on offset kinetics (GYKI 53405 IC50 16.6 +/- 4.2 microM). However, the 2,3-benzodiazepines were unable to reintroduce desensitization in the presence of cyclothiazide and even concentration-dependently slowed the onset kinetics of AMPA responses further (GYKI 53405 EC50 8.0 +/- 2.8 microM). 6. GYKI 52466 decreased the peak amplitude of hippocampal area CA1 AMPA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (e.p.s.cs) (IC50 10.8 +/- 0.8 microM) with no apparent effect on response kinetics. Cyclothiazide prolonged the decay time constant of AMPA receptor-mediated e.p.s.cs (EC50 35.7 +/- 6.5 microM) with less pronounced effects in slowing e.p.s.c. onset kinetics and increasing e.p.s.c. amplitude. 7. Cyclothiazide (330 microM) shifted the concentration-response curve for the effects of GYKI 52466 on AMPA receptor-mediated e.p.s.c. peak amplitude to the right (GYKI 52466 IC50 26.9 +/- 9.4 microM). Likewise, GYKI 52466 (30-100 microM)) shifted the concentration-response curve for the effects of cyclothiazide on AMPA receptor-mediated e.p.s.c. decay time constants to the right. 8. In conclusion, cyclothiazide and the 2,3-benzodiazepines seem to bind to different sites on AMPA receptors but exert strong allosteric interactions with one another and with other domains such as the agonist recognition site. The interactions of GYKI 52466 and cyclothiazide on AMPA receptor-mediated e.p.s.cs in area CA1 of hippocampal slices provide evidence that the decay time constant of these synaptic events are not governed by desensitization.
23318445	Evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired ROS detoxifying machinery in Fanconi Anemia cells.	Fanconi Anemia (FA) is a rare genetic disorder associated with a bone-marrow failure, cancer predisposition and hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents. Majority of the 15 FA genes and encoded proteins characterized so far are integrated into DNA repair pathways, however, other important functions cannot be excluded. FA cells are sensitive to oxidants, and accumulation of oxidized proteins has been characterized for several FA subgroups. Clinical phenotypes of both FA and other closely related diseases suggest altered functions of mitochondria, organelles responsible for cellular energetic metabolism, and also serving as an important producer and the most susceptible target from reactive oxidative species (ROS). In this study, we have shown that elevated level of mitochondrial ROS in FA cells is in parallel with the decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential, the decrease of ATP production, impaired oxygen uptake and pathological changes in the morphology of mitochondria. This is accompanied by inactivation of enzymes that are essential for the energy production (F1F0ATPase and cytochrome C oxidase) and detoxification of ROS (superoxide dismutase, SOD1). In turn, overexpression of SOD1 could rescue oxygen consumption rate in FA-deficient cells. Importantly, the depletion of mitochondria improved survival rate of mitomycin C treated FA cells suggesting that hypersensitivity of FA cells to chemotherapeutic drugs could be in part due to the mitochondria-mediated oxidative stress. On the basis of our results, we propose that deficiency in FA genes lead to disabling mitochondrial ROS-scavenging machinery further affecting mitochondrial functions and suppressing cell respiration.Oncogene advance online publication, 14 January 2013; doi:10.1038/onc.2012.583.
17381051	The role of glutathione transferases M1 and T1 in individual susceptibility to bladder cancer in a Tunisian population.	BACKGROUND: Susceptibility to bladder cancer is thought to depend on interplay between genetic factors and environmental chemical carcinogens. AIM: This study seeks to determine the role of the glutathione transferases M1 and T1 null genotypes (GSTM1*0 and GSTT1*0) in individual susceptibility to bladder cancer in a Tunisian population. METHOD: Sixty-two patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder cancer and 79 controls were examined with respect to the frequency of GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotypes. RESULTS: The frequencies of the GSTT1 null in the total group of bladder cancer cases vs. controls did not differ statistically. The proportion of GSTM1 null genotype in patients was 63% compared to 45% in controls group (OR = 2.03; 95% CI 0.97-4.24; p = 0.04). A significantly higher incidence of GSTM1 deletion genotype was found in smokers with bladder cancer compared to the controls (65.38% vs. 45.5%). Smokers lacking the GSTM1 gene are at an approximately 2.2-fold higher risk of bladder cancer (OR= 2.23, 95% CI 1-5.15; p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that in Tunisian subjects the GSTM1 null genotype may be associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer. This association appears to depend upon smoking status.
23557688	Environmental pesticide exposure modulates cytokines, arginase and ornithine decarboxylase expression in human placenta.	To evaluate the cytokine balance and enzymatic alterations induced by environmental pesticide exposure during pregnancy, this transversal study explored placentas derived from non-exposed women (control group-CG), and from women living in a rural area (rural group-RG), collected during intensive organophosphate (OP) pesticide spraying season (RG-SS) and during non-spraying season (RG-NSS). The exposure biomarkers blood cholinesterase and placental carboxylesterase (CaE) were significantly decreased in RG-SS. Among the cytokines studied IL-8, IL-6, TNFα, IL-10, TGFβ and IL-13, the expression frequency of IL-13 increased in RG-SS. Arginase and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) enzymes were induced in syncytiotrophoblast and endothelial cells. Interestingly, the decrease in CaE activity was associated with arginase and ODC activity induction. These findings suggest that environmental pesticide exposure impacts the placenta by increasing the expression frequency of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-13, which may be related to the up-regulation of enzymes implicated in tissue repair.
23298577	Synthesis, characterization and targeting potential of zidovudine loaded sialic acid conjugated-mannosylated poly(propyleneimine) dendrimers.	The present investigation was aimed at exploring dual targeting of anti-HIV drug, zidovudine (ZDV) via sialic acid conjugated-mannosylated poly(propyleneimine) (PPI) dendritic nano-constructs. Fourth generation PPI dendrimers, sialic acid conjugated PPI dendrimers (SPPI), mannose conjugated PPI dendrimers (MPPI) and dual ligand system i.e. sialic acid conjugated-mannosylated PPI dendrimers (SMPPI) were synthesized and characterized by FT-IR and (1)H NMR spectroscopies and were further confirmed by size exclusion chromatography and differential scanning calorimetry. Various parameters like drug loading, pH dependent in vitro release, hemolytic toxicity, macrophage uptake and cytotoxicity concerning PPI, SPPI, MPPI and SMPPI dendrimers were evaluated. ZDV loaded SMPPI, SPPI and MPPI have shown reduced hemolytic toxicity, cytotoxicity and in vitro drug release at pH 7.4. Extremely significant (P<0.001) increase in cellular uptake of ZDV by macrophage cells was observed in case of SMPPI as compared to PPI and free drug. The in vivo blood level and tissue distribution studies in albino rats also demonstrated potential of dual targeted system towards sialoadhesin and carbohydrate receptors. The drug concentration in lymph nodes was increased to about 28 times in case of SMPPI (1335 ± 17.6 ng/g) as compared to free drug (48 ± 5.8 ng/g) at 6th hr. The results suggested that such dual ligand dendritic system (SMPPI) hold potential to enhance biocompatibility and site specific delivery of antiretroviral drug, ZDV.
9336833	The structures of thymidine kinase from herpes simplex virus type 1 in complex with substrates and a substrate analogue.	Thymidine kinase from Herpes simplex virus type 1 (TK) was crystallized in an N-terminally truncated but fully active form. The structures of TK complexed with ADP at the ATP-site and deoxythymidine-5'-monophosphate (dTMP), deoxythymidine (dT), or idoxuridine-5'-phosphate (5-iodo-dUMP) at the substrate-site were refined to 2.75 A, 2.8 A, and 3.0 A resolution, respectively. TK catalyzes the phosphorylation of dT resulting in an ester, and the phosphorylation of dTMP giving rise to an anhydride. The presented TK structures indicate that there are only small differences between these two modes of action. Glu83 serves as a general base in the ester reaction. Arg163 parks at an internal aspartate during ester formation and binds the alpha-phosphate of dTMP during anhydride formation. The bound deoxythymidine leaves a 35 A3 cavity at position 5 of the base and two sequestered water molecules at position 2. Cavity and water molecules reduce the substrate specificity to such an extent that TK can phosphorylate various substrate analogues useful in pharmaceutical applications. TK is structurally homologous to the well-known nucleoside monophosphate kinases but contains large additional peptide segments.
16940412	Comparison of the activities of the truncated halichondrin B analog NSC 707389 (E7389) with those of the parent compound and a proposed binding site on tubulin.	The complex marine natural product halichondrin B was compared with NSC 707389 (E7389), a structurally simplified, synthetic macrocyclic ketone analog, which has been selected for clinical trials in human patients. NSC 707389 was invariably more potent than halichondrin B in its interactions with tubulin. Both compounds inhibited tubulin assembly, inhibited nucleotide exchange on beta-tubulin, and were noncompetitive inhibitors of the binding of radiolabeled vinblastine and dolastatin 10 to tubulin. Neither compound seemed to induce an aberrant tubulin assembly reaction, as occurs with vinblastine (tight spirals) or dolastatin 10 (aggregated rings and spirals). We modeled the two compounds into a shared binding site on tubulin consistent with their biochemical properties. Of the two tubulin structures available, we selected for modeling the complex of a stathmin fragment with two tubulin heterodimers with two bound colchicinoid molecules and a single bound vinblastine between the two heterodimers (Nature (Lond) 435:519-522, 2005). Halichondrin B and NSC 707389 fit snugly between the two heterodimers adjacent to the exchangeable site nucleotide. Fitting the compounds into this site, which was also close to the vinblastine site, resulted in enough movement of amino acid residues at the vinblastine site to cause the latter compound to bind less well to tubulin. The model suggests that halichondrin B and NSC 707389 most likely form highly unstable, small aberrant tubulin polymers rather than the massive stable structures observed with vinca alkaloids and antimitotic peptides.
12522078	Evidence against beta 3-adrenoceptors or low affinity state of beta 1-adrenoceptors mediating relaxation in rat isolated aorta.	"1 The presence of beta(3)-adrenoceptors and the low affinity state of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor (formerly ""putative beta(4)-adrenoceptor"") was investigated in ring preparations of rat isolated aorta preconstricted with phenylephrine or prostaglandin F(2alpha) (PGF(2alpha)). Relaxant responses to isoprenaline, selective beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonists (BRL 37344, SR 58611A, CL 316243) and non-conventional partial agonists (CGP 12177A, cyanopindolol, pindolol) were obtained. 2 In phenylephrine-constricted, but not PGF(2alpha)-constricted rings, relaxations to isoprenaline showed a propranolol-resistant component. 3 In phenylephrine-constricted rings, relaxations to BRL 37344 (pEC(50), 4.64) and SR 58611A (pEC(50), 4.94) were not antagonized by the selective beta(3)-adrenoceptor antagonist SR 59230A (< or =1 microM). CL 316243 (< or =100 microM) failed to produce relaxation. In PGF(2alpha)-constricted rings only SR 58611A produced relaxation, which was not affected by SR 59230A (< or =3 microM). 4 Non-conventional partial agonists produced relaxation in phenylephrine-constricted but not PGF(2alpha)-constricted rings. The relaxation to CGP 12177A was unaffected by SR 59230A (< or =1 microM) or by CGP 20712A (10 microM), reported to block the low affinity state of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor. 5 beta-adrenoceptor antagonists also produced relaxation in phenylephrine-constricted rings with an order of potency of (pEC(50) values): bupranolol (5.5) approximately 38;SR 59230A (5.47) approximately 38;cyanopindolol (5.47)>pindolol (5.30)>alprenolol (5.10)>propranolol (4.83)>ICI 118551 (4.60)>CGP 12177A (4.38) approximately 38;CGP 20712A (4.35). Bupranolol (100 microM), alprenolol (30 microM), propranolol (100 microM) and SR 59230A (10 microM) produced no relaxation in PGF(2alpha)-constricted rings. 6 These results provide no evidence for the presence of functional beta(3)-adrenoceptors or the low affinity state of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor in rat aorta."
23483103	The induction of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells by ruthenium(ii) asymmetric complexes.	Four ruthenium(ii) asymmetric complexes, [Ru(bpy)2(PAIDH)](2+) (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine, PAIDH = 2-pyridyl-1H-anthra[1,2-d]imidazole-6,11-dione, ), [Ru(phen)2(PAIDH)](2+) (phen = 1,10-phenanthroline, ), [Ru(dmp)2(PAIDH)](2+) (dmp = 4,7-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline, ) and [Ru(dip)2(PAIDH)](2+) (dip = 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline, ), have been synthesized and characterized. These complexes displayed potent anti-proliferation activity against various cancer cell lines and had high selectivity between tumor cells and normal cells. HeLa cells exhibited the highest sensitivity to complex , accounting for the greatest cellular uptake. Complex was shown to accumulate preferentially in the mitochondria of HeLa cells and induced apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway, which involved ROS generation, mitochondrial membrane potential depolarisation, and Bcl-2 and caspase family members activation. These results demonstrated that complex induced cancer cell apoptosis by acting on mitochondrial pathways.
23611835	Molecular Mechanisms of the antitumor activity of SB225002: A novel microtubule inhibitor.	SB225002 (SB) is an IL-8 receptor B (IL-8RB) antagonist that has previously been shown to inhibit IL-8-based cancer cell invasion, and to possess in vivo anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects. The present study presented an evidence for the cell cycle-targeting activity of SB in a panel of p53-mutant human cancer cell lines of different origin, and investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms. A combination of cell cycle analysis, immunocytometry, immunoblotting, and RNA interference revealed that SB induced a BubR1-dependent mitotic arrest. Mechanistically, SB was shown to possess a microtubule destabilizing activity evidenced by hyperphosphorylation of Bcl2 and BclxL, suppression of microtubule polymerization and induction of a prometaphase arrest. Molecular docking studies suggested that SB has a good affinity towards vinblastine-binding site on β-tubulin subunit. Of note, SB265610 which is a close structural analogue of SB225002 with a potent IL-8RB antagonistic activity did not exhibit a similar antimitotic activity. Importantly, in P-glycoprotein overexpressing NCI/Adr-Res cells the antitumor activity of SB was unaffected by multidrug resistance. Interestingly, the mechanisms of SB-induced cell death were cell-line dependent, where in invasive hepatocellular carcinoma HLE cells the significant contribution of BAK-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis was demonstrated. Conversely, SB activated p38 MAPK signaling in colorectal adenocarcinoma cells SW480, and pharmacologic inhibition of p38 MAPK activity revealed its key role in mediating SB-induced caspase-independent cell death. In summary, the present study introduced SB as a promising antitumor agent which has the potential to exert its activity through dual mechanisms involving microtubules targeting and interference with IL-8-drivin cancer progression.
22422627	Berberine inhibits myofibroblast differentiation in nasal polyp-derived fibroblasts via the p38 pathway.	The purposes of this study were to determine whether berberine has any effect on phenotype changes and extracellular matrix (ECM) production in nasal polyp-derived fibroblasts (NPDFs) and to investigate the underlying molecular mechanism. NPDFs were pre-treated with berberine prior to induction by transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1. The expression of α-smooth muscle actin (SMA) and collagen type I mRNA was determined by a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and the expression of α-SMA protein and collagen type I was determined by western blotting and/or immunofluorescent staining. The total soluble collagen production was analysed by the SirCol collagen assay. The expression of several signaling molecules of the TGF-β1 pathway was evaluated by western blot analysis. In TGF-β1-induced NPDFs, berberine significantly inhibited the expression of α-SMA and collagen type I mRNA and reduced α-SMA and collagen protein levels. Berberine only suppressed the expression of pp38 among the evaluated signaling molecules. SB203580 (a specific inhibitor of p38 kinase) markedly suppressed the increased expression of collagen type I and α-SMA in TGF-β1-induced NPDFs. Berberine exerts suppressive effects on phenotype changes and ECM production in NPDFs via p38 signaling pathway interference. The findings provide new therapeutic options for ECM production in nasal polyps.
22406476	Aspirin inhibits mTOR signaling, activates AMP-activated protein kinase, and induces autophagy in colorectal cancer cells.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Aspirin reduces the incidence of and mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC) by unknown mechanisms. Cancer cells have defects in signaling via the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), which regulates proliferation. We investigated whether aspirin affects adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mTOR signaling in CRC cells. METHODS: The effects of aspirin on mTOR signaling, the ribosomal protein S6, S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) were examined in CRC cells by immunoblotting. Phosphorylation of AMPK was measured; the effects of loss of AMPKalpha on the aspirin-induced effects of mTOR were determined using small interfering RNA (siRNA) in CRC cells and in AMPK(alpha1/alpha2-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts. LC3 and ULK1 were used as markers of autophagy. We analyzed rectal mucosa samples from patients given 600 mg aspirin, once daily for 1 week. RESULTS: Aspirin reduced mTOR signaling in CRC cells by inhibiting the mTOR effectors S6K1 and 4E-BP1. Aspirin changed nucleotide ratios and activated AMPK in CRC cells. mTOR was still inhibited by aspirin in CRC cells after siRNA knockdown of AMPKalpha, indicating AMPK-dependent and AMPK-independent mechanisms of aspirin-induced inhibition of mTOR. Aspirin induced autophagy, a feature of mTOR inhibition. Aspirin and metformin (an activator of AMPK) increased inhibition of mTOR and Akt, as well as autophagy in CRC cells. Rectal mucosal samples from patients given aspirin had reduced phosphorylation of S6K1 and S6. CONCLUSIONS: Aspirin is an inhibitor of mTOR and an activator of AMPK, targeting regulators of intracellular energy homeostasis and metabolism. These could contribute to its protective effects against development of CRC.
17603545	Alpha1-adrenoceptors are required for normal male sexual function.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists are extensively used in the treatment of hypertension and lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Among the side effects, ejaculatory dysfunction occurs more frequently with drugs that are relatively selective for alpha(1A)-adrenoceptors compared with other drugs of this class. This suggests that alpha(1A)-adrenoceptors may contribute to ejaculation. However, this has not been studied at the molecular level. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The physiological contribution of each alpha(1)-adrenoceptor subtype was characterized using alpha(1)-adrenoceptor subtype-selective knockout (KO) mice (alpha(1A)-, alpha(1B)- and alpha(1D)-AR KO mice) since the subtype-specific drugs available are only moderately selective. We analysed the role of alpha(1)-adrenoceptors in the blood pressure and vascular response as well as ejaculation by determining these variables in alpha(1)-adrenoceptor subtype-selective KO mice and in mice with all their alpha(1)-adrenoceptor subtypes deleted (alpha(1)-AR triple-KO mice). KEY RESULTS: The pregnancy rate was reduced by 50% in alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor KO mice, and this reduction was dramatically enhanced in alpha(1)-adrenoceptor triple-KO mice. Contractile tension of the vas deferens in response to noradrenaline was markedly decreased in alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor KO mice, and this contraction was completely abolished in alpha(1)-adrenoceptor triple-KO mice. This attenuation of contractility was also observed in the electrically stimulated vas deferens. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These results demonstrate that alpha(1)-adrenoceptors, particularly alpha(1A)-adrenoceptors, are required for normal contractility of the vas deferens and consequent sperm ejaculation as well as having a function in fertility.
16199482	Metabolite ligands of estrogen receptor-beta reduce primate coronary hyperreactivity.	Previous reports showed that 17beta-estradiol implants attenuate in vivo coronary hyperreactivity (CH), characterized by long-duration vasoconstrictions (in coronary angiographic experiments), in menopausal rhesus monkeys. Prolonged Ca2+ contraction signals that correspond with CH in coronary vascular muscle cells (VMC) to the same dual-constrictor stimulus, serotonin + the thromboxane analog U-46619, in estrogen-deprived VMC were suppressed by >72 h in 17beta-estradiol. The purpose of this study was to test whether an endogenous estrogen metabolite with estrogen receptor-beta (ER-beta) binding activity, estriol (E3), suppresses in vivo and in vitro CH. E3 treatment in vivo for 4 wk significantly attenuated the angiographically evaluated vasoconstrictor response to intracoronary serotonin + U-46619 challenge. In vitro treatment of rhesus coronary VMC for >72 h with nanomolar E3 attenuated late Ca2+ signals. This reduction of late Ca2+ signals also appeared after >72 h of treatment with subnanomolar 5alpha-androstane-3beta,17beta-diol (3beta-Adiol), an endogenous dihydrotestosterone metabolite with ER-beta binding activity. R,R-tetrahydrochrysene, a selective ER-beta antagonist, significantly blocked the E3- and 3beta-Adiol-mediated attenuation of late Ca2+ signal increases. ER-beta and thromboxane-prostanoid receptor (TPR) were coexpressed in coronary arteries and aorta. In vivo E3 treatment attenuated aortic TPR expression. Furthermore, in vitro treatment with E3 or 3beta-Adiol downregulated TPR expression in VMC, which was blocked for both agonists by pretreatment with R,R-tetrahydrochrysene. E3- and 3beta-Adiol-mediated reduction in persistent Ca2+ signals is associated with ER-beta-mediated attenuation of TPR expression and may partly explain estrogen benefits in coronary vascular muscle.
23161868	Ras-dva is a novel Pit-1- and glucocorticoid-regulated gene in the embryonic anterior pituitary gland.	Glucocorticoids play a role in functional differentiation of pituitary somatotrophs and lactotrophs during embryogenesis. Ras-dva was identified as a gene regulated by anterior neural fold protein-1/homeobox expressed in embryonic stem cells-1, a transcription factor known to be critical in pituitary development, and has an expression profile in the chicken embryonic pituitary gland that is consistent with in vivo regulation by glucocorticoids. The objective of this study was to characterize expression and regulation of ras-dva mRNA in the developing chicken anterior pituitary. Pituitary ras-dva mRNA levels increased during embryogenesis to a maximum on embryonic day (e) 18 and then decreased and remained low or undetectable after hatch. Ras-dva expression was highly enriched in the pituitary gland on e18 relative to other tissues examined. Glucocorticoid treatment of pituitary cells from mid- and late-stage embryos rapidly increased ras-dva mRNA, suggesting it may be a direct transcriptional target of glucocorticoids. A reporter construct driven by 4 kb of the chicken ras-dva 5'-flanking region, containing six putative pituitary-specific transcription factor-1 (Pit-1) binding sites and two potential glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding sites, was highly activated in embryonic pituitary cells and up-regulated by corticosterone. Mutagenesis of the most proximal Pit-1 site decreased promoter activity in chicken e11 pituitary cells, indicating regulation of ras-dva by Pit-1. However, mutating putative GR binding sites did not substantially reduce induction of ras-dva promoter activity by corticosterone, suggesting additional DNA elements within the 5'-flanking region are responsible for glucocorticoid regulation. We have identified ras-dva as a glucocorticoid-regulated gene that is likely expressed in cells of the Pit-1 lineage within the developing anterior pituitary gland.
8052854	Inhibition of NF-kappa B by sodium salicylate and aspirin.	The transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) is critical for the inducible expression of multiple cellular and viral genes involved in inflammation and infection including interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and adhesion molecules. The anti-inflammatory drugs sodium salicylate and aspirin inhibited the activation of NF-kappa B, which further explains the mechanism of action of these drugs. This inhibition prevented the degradation of the NF-kappa B inhibitor, I kappa B, and therefore NF-kappa B was retained in the cytosol. Sodium salicylate and aspirin also inhibited NF-kappa B-dependent transcription from the Ig kappa enhancer and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) long terminal repeat (LTR) in transfected T cells.
14967461	Emerging role of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition in therapy for advanced malignancy: focus on NSCLC.	Combination chemotherapy regimens have emerged as the standard approach in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. Meta-analyses have demonstrated a 2-month increase in median survival after platinum-based therapy vs. best supportive care, and an absolute 10% improvement in the 1-year survival rate. Just as importantly, cytotoxic therapy has produced benefits in symptom control and quality of life. Newer agents, including the taxanes, vinorelbine, gemcitabine, and irinotecan, have expanded our therapeutic options in the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. Despite their contributions, we have reached a therapeutic plateau, with response rates seldom exceeding 30-40% in cooperative group studies and 1-year survival rates stable between 30% and 40%. It is doubtful that substituting one agent for another in various combinations will lead to any further improvement in these rates. The thrust of current research has focused on targeted therapy, and epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition is one of the most promising clinical strategies. Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors currently under investigation include the small molecules gefitinib (Iressa, ZD1839) and erlotinib (Tarceva, OSI-774), as well as monoclonal antibodies such as cetuximab (IMC-225, Erbitux). Agents that have only begun to undergo clinical evaluation include CI-1033, an irreversible pan-erbB tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and PKI166 and GW572016, both examples of dual kinase inhibitors (inhibiting epidermal growth factor receptor and Her2). Preclinical models have demonstrated synergy for all these agents in combination with either chemotherapy or radiotherapy, leading to great enthusiasm regarding their ultimate contribution to lung cancer therapy. However, serious clinical challenges persist. These include the identification of the optimal dose(s); the proper integration of these agents into popular, established cytotoxic regimens; and the selection of the optimal setting(s) in which to test these compounds. Both gefitinib and erlotinib have shown clinical activity in pretreated, advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, but placebo-controlled randomized Phase III studies evaluating gefitinib in combination with standard cytotoxic therapy, to our chagrin, have failed to demonstrate a survival advantage compared with chemotherapy alone.
10368402	Maturation of neuromuscular transmission during early development in zebrafish.	We have examined the rapid development of synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in zebrafish embryos and larvae by patch-clamp recording of spontaneous miniature endplate currents (mEPCs) and single acetylcholine receptor (AChR) channels. Embryonic (24-36 h) mEPCs recorded in vivo were small in amplitude (<50 pA). The rate of mEPCs increased in larvae (3.5-fold increase measured by 6 days), and these mEPCs were mostly of larger amplitude (10-fold on average) with (</=5-fold) faster kinetics. Intracellular labeling with Lucifer yellow indicated extensive coupling between muscle cells in both embryos and larvae (</=10 days). Blocking acetylcholinesterase (AChE) with eserine had no effect on mEPC kinetics in embryos at 1 day and only partially slowed (by approximately 1/2) the decay rate in larvae at 6 days. In acutely dissociated muscle cells, we observed the same two types of AChR with conductances of 45 and 60 pS and with similar, brief (<0.5 ms) mean open times in both embryos and larvae. We conclude that AChR properties are set early during development at these early stages; functional maturation of the NMJ is only partly shaped by expression of AChE and may also depend on postsynaptic AChR clustering and presynaptic maturation.
23578392	The time point of β-catenin knockout in hepatocytes determines their response to xenobiotic activation of the constitutive androstane receptor.	The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) controls the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and regulates hepatocyte proliferation. Studies with transgenic mice with an early postnatal conditional hepatocyte-specific knockout of the β-catenin gene Ctnnb1 revealed that β-catenin deficiency decreases the magnitude of induction of drug-metabolizing enzymes by CAR activators, abrogates zonal differences in the hepatocytes' susceptibility to these compounds, and impacts on hepatocyte proliferation. These data, however, do not allow distinguishing between effects caused by β-catenin deficiency during postnatal liver development and acute effects of β-catenin deficiency in the adult animal at the time point of CAR activation. Therefore, CAR activation was now studied in a different mouse model allowing for the hepatocyte-specific knockout of β-catenin in adult mice. Treatment of these mice with 3mg/kg body weight of the model CAR activator 1,4-bis-[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene (TCPOBOP) confirmed previous findings related to the coordinate regulation of drug metabolism by β-catenin and CAR. More importantly, the present study clarified that the impact of β-catenin signaling on CAR-mediated enzyme induction in the liver is not merely due to developmental defects caused by a postnatal lack of β-catenin, but depends on the presence of β-catenin at the time point of xenobiotic treatment. The study also revealed interesting differences between the two mouse models: hepatic zonation of TCPOBOP-dependent induction of drug-metabolizing enzymes was restored in mice with late knockout of β-catenin, and the strong proliferative response of female mice was exclusively abolished when using animals with a late β-catenin knockout. This suggests a β-catenin-dependent postnatal priming of hepatocytes during postnatal liver development, later affecting the proliferative response of adult animals to CAR-activating xenobiotics.
23164673	The glycogen synthase kinase-3β/nuclear factor-kappa B pathway is involved in cinobufagin-induced apoptosis in cultured osteosarcoma cells.	Cinobufagin, a major component of cinobufacini (huachansu), is an important cardenolidal steroid. Several studies have suggested that cinobufagin has potent anti-cancer effects. The present study examines the apoptosis-inducing activity and the underlying mechanism of action of cinobufagin in osteosarcoma (OS) cells. Our results showed that cinobufagin potently inhibited the proliferation of U2OS, MG63 and SaOS-2 cells. Significant increases in G2/M cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in OS cells were also observed. The expression levels of several apoptotic proteins were assessed after cinobufagin treatment in U2OS cells. Among them, xIAP, cIAP-1, survivin and Bcl-2 levels decreased remarkably, while the levels of Bax and cleaved-PARP increased. Furthermore, we validated the inhibition of GSK-3β/NF-κB signaling following cinobufagin treatment. Western blots showed a decrease in nuclear p65 protein expression after exposure to different concentrations of cinobufagin, while the phosphorylation of GSK-3β was simultaneously increased. Transduction with constitutively active forms of GSK-3β could protect against the downregulation of p65 and upregulation of cleaved-PARP that are induced by cinobufagin treatment. However, combined treatment with cinobufagin and SB216367 resulted in a significant reduction in p65 and an increase in cleaved-PARP in U2OS cells. Altogether, these results show that cinobufagin is a promising agent for the treatment of OS. These studies are the first to reveal the involvement of the GSK-3β/NF-κB pathway in cinobufagin-induced apoptosis.
16842172	Dopaminergic enhancement of cognitive function.	The ascending dopamine system of the mammalian brain has been associated with motor, mnemonic and goal-directed or reward-related behaviour. The most progress in understanding the cortical mechanisms of dopaminergic modulation of function has been made with regards to short-term mnemonic (or working memory) function. Research in experimental animals strongly suggests that stimulation of dopamine D1 receptors in the prefrontal cortex can ameliorate spatial working memory related cognitive deficits, and may even enhance cognitive function in healthy animals. Research in humans has not been able to clearly replicate these findings, partly due to the lack of available agents that can safely be used. Low doses of dopamine D2 receptor agonists such as bromocriptine and pergolide may be able to enhance working memory and executive functions, but these effects may be dependent on the nature of the tasks used and the baseline performance levels of the subjects. Thus, the effects of dopaminergic cognitive enhancers may not be simple, or uniform across subjects. Systematic studies in humans carefully controlling task parameters are needed in order to specify the potential cognitive processes open to enhancement with dopaminergics. However, since the DA receptor subtypes in different brain regions appear to differentially influence similar functions, carefully defining the cognitive processes to be tested against potential therapeutics is an equally important goal. Studies in patients groups using selective dopaminergics are rather restricted, but show promise for designing large-scale clinical trials into the cognitive enhancing properties of potential therapeutic agents that act through the dopamine system.
23425969	Synthesis, in vitro antiplatelet activity and molecular modelling studies of 10-substituted 2-(1-piperazinyl)pyrimido[1,2-a]benzimidazol-4(10H)-ones.	The multistep preparation of the new 10-substituted 2-(1-piperazinyl)pyrimido[1,2-a]benzimidazol-4(10H)-ones 6a-o, and of the two isomers 10-ethyl-2-(diethylamino)pyrimido[1,2-a]benzimidazol-4(10H)-one 6p and 10-ethyl-4-(diethylamino)pyrimido[1,2-a]benzimidazol-2(10H)-one 13, as well as the in vitro evaluation of their inhibitory activity on human platelet aggregation induced in platelet-rich plasma by ADP, collagen or the Ca(2+) ionophore A23187 were here described. Nine out of fifteen 2-(1-piperazinyl)derivatives (6g-o) showed good inhibitory properties towards all the platelet aggregation agonists used. Moreover, a molecular modelling study has been performed on two of the best compounds of this series (6i and 6o) to confirm in silico their interactions with the catalytic site of human platelet PDE3, using the X-ray data of the PDE3B isoform in complex with an inhibitor.
23274898	Electrical Stimuli Release ATP to Increase GLUT4 Translocation and Glucose Uptake via PI3Kγ-Akt-AS160 in Skeletal Muscle Cells.	Skeletal muscle glucose uptake in response to exercise is preserved in insulin-resistant conditions, but the signals involved are debated. ATP is released from skeletal muscle by contractile activity and can autocrinely signal through purinergic receptors, and we hypothesized it may influence glucose uptake. Electrical stimulation, ATP, and insulin each increased fluorescent 2-NBD-Glucose (2-NBDG) uptake in primary myotubes, but only electrical stimulation and ATP-dependent 2-NBDG uptake were inhibited by adenosine-phosphate phosphatase and by purinergic receptor blockade (suramin). Electrical stimulation transiently elevated extracellular ATP and caused Akt phosphorylation that was additive to insulin and inhibited by suramin. Exogenous ATP transiently activated Akt and, inhibiting phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) or Akt as well as dominant-negative Akt mutant, reduced ATP-dependent 2-NBDG uptake and Akt phosphorylation. ATP-dependent 2-NBDG uptake was also inhibited by the G protein βγ subunit-interacting peptide βark-ct and by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-γ (PI3Kγ) inhibitor AS605240. ATP caused translocation of GLUT4myc-eGFP to the cell surface, mechanistically mediated by increased exocytosis involving AS160/Rab8A reduced by dominant-negative Akt or PI3Kγ kinase-dead mutants, and potentiated by myristoylated PI3Kγ. ATP stimulated 2-NBDG uptake in normal and insulin-resistant adult muscle fibers, resembling the reported effect of exercise. Hence, the ATP-induced pathway may be tapped to bypass insulin resistance.
23244580	Effects and mechanism of organ protection by cardiotrophin-1.	Cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), a member of the interleukin (IL)-6 family, is reported to exhibit a plethora of pleiotropic effects in the heart such as cytoprotective, pro-proliferative and pro-fibrotic ones. An extensive research has been devoted on proliferative and profibrotic effects of CT-1 on the heart. Thus the present review has been aimed to critically define the cytoprotective effects of CT-1 and the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in them. Although many effects of CT-1 have been described on the heart, CT-1 has now also been reported to exhibit important protective effects in other organs such as liver, kidney or nervous system. CT-1 produces its effects through a unique receptor system comprising LIF receptor (LIFRβ) and a common signal transducer, the glycoprotein 130 (gp130). The signaling pathway downstream from gp130 is based on at least, three distinct pathways: 1) the janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway, 2) the p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p42/44 MAPK) pathway, also known as the extracellular receptor kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway, and 3) the phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. Since CT-1 easily achieves its cytoprotective effects via a combination of the above three signaling pathways, it becomes quite necessary to determine which pathway(s) is involved in each particular effect of CT-1. In each of its target organs, CT-1 may also display differential mechanisms of cytoprotection, and thus it is relevant to understand how these mechanisms are locally regulated.
10212269	Fibroblast growth factor-10. A second candidate stromal to epithelial cell andromedin in prostate.	Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-10, a homologue of FGF-7, is expressed significantly in normal rat prostate tissue, well differentiated rat prostate tumors with an epithelial and stromal compartment and only in derived prostate stromal cells in culture. Similar to FGF-7, recombinant rat FGF-10 was a specific mitogen for prostate epithelial cells. In contrast to FGF-7 which is widely expressed among stromal cells in tissues, the expression of FGF-10 correlated with the presence of stromal cells of muscle origin. Radioreceptor binding assays and covalent cross-linking analysis revealed that FGF-10 binds with an affinity equal to FGF-7 to resident epithelial cell receptor, FGFR2IIIb, but unlike FGF-7 also binds the IIIb splice variant of FGFR1. Analysis of mRNA expression by RNase protection revealed that, similar to FGF-7, the expression of FGF-10 was responsive to androgen in stromal cells from normal prostate and non-malignant differentiated tumors. Although FGF-10 cDNA exhibits a signal sequence for secretion, cultured stromal cells exhibit strictly a cell-associated FGF-10 antigen that correlates with an alternately translated intracellular isoform. FGF-10 requires 1.4 times higher NaCl for elution from immobilized heparin than does FGF-7 and binds to four times the number of sites on the pericellular matrix of epithelial cells. The results show that prostate stromal cell-derived FGF-10, like FGF-7, exhibits the properties of an andromedin which may indirectly mediate control of epithelial cell growth and function by androgen. Although FGF-10 and FGF-7 bind and activate the same resident epithelial cell receptor (FGFR2IIIb), differences in cell type of origin, compartmentation by alternate translation, the affinity for FGFR1IIIb, and access to FGFR by differential interaction with pericellular matrix heparan sulfate suggest they may play both independent and compensatory roles in prostate homeostasis.
22397675	Injectable PLA-based in situ forming implants for controlled release of Ivermectin a BCS Class II drug: solvent selection based on physico-chemical characterization.	In situ forming implants (ISI) prepared from biodegradable polymers such as poly(D,L-lactide) (PLA) and biocompatible solvents can be used to obtain sustained drug release after parenteral administration. The aim of this work was to study the effect of several biocompatible solvents with different physico-chemical properties on the release of ivermectin (IVM), an antiparasitic BCS II drug, from in situ forming PLA-based implants. The solvents evaluated were N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), 2-pyrrolidone (2P), triacetine (TA) and benzyl benzoate (BB). Hansen's solubility parameters of solvents were used to explain polymer/solvent interactions leading to different rheological behaviours. The stability of the polymer and drug in the solvents were also evaluated by size exclusion and high performance liquid chromatography, respectively. The two major factors determining the rate of IVM release from ISI were miscibility of the solvent with water and the viscosity of the polymer solutions. In general, the release rate increased with increasing water miscibility of the solvent and decreasing viscosity in the following order NMP>2P>TA>BB. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a relationship between the rate of IVM release and the surface porosity of the implants, release being higher as implant porosity increased. Finally, drug and polymer stability in the solvents followed the same trends, increasing when polymer-solvent affinities and water content in solvents decreased. IVM degradation was accelerated by the acid environment generated by the degradation of the polymer but the drug did not affect PLA stability.
23274887	Fetal PGC-1α overexpression programs adult pancreatic β-cell dysfunction.	Adult β-cell dysfunction, a hallmark of type 2 diabetes, can be programmed by adverse fetal environment. We have shown that fetal glucocorticoids (GCs) participate in this programming through inhibition of β-cell development. Here we have investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying this regulation. We showed that GCs stimulate the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), a coregulator of the GCs receptor (GR), and that the overexpression of PGC-1α represses genes important for β-cell development and function. More precisely, PGC-1α inhibited the expression of the key β-cell transcription factor pancreatic duodenal homeobox 1 (Pdx1). This repression required the GR and was mediated through binding of a GR/PGC-1α complex to the Pdx1 promoter. To explore PGC-1α function, we generated mice with inducible β-cell PGC-1α overexpression. Mice overexpressing PGC-1α exhibited at adult age impaired glucose tolerance associated with reduced insulin secretion, decreased β-cell mass, and β-cell hypotrophy. Interestingly, PGC-1α expression in fetal life only was sufficient to impair adult β-cell function whereas β-cell PGC-1α overexpression from adult age had no consequence on β-cell function. Altogether, our results demonstrate that the GR and PGC-1α participate in the fetal programming of adult β-cell function through inhibition of Pdx1 expression.
15240882	Thyroid hormone receptor alpha is a molecular switch of cardiac function between fetal and postnatal life.	Thyroid hormones are involved in the regulation of many physiological processes and regulate gene transcription by binding to their nuclear receptors TRalpha and TRbeta. In the absence of triiodothyronine (T3), the unliganded receptors (aporeceptors) do bind DNA and repress the transcription of target genes. The role of thyroid hormone aporeceptors as repressors was observed in hypothyroid adult mice, but its physiological relevance in nonpathological hypothyroid conditions remained to be determined. Here we show that, in the normal mouse fetus, TRalpha aporeceptors repress heart rate as well as the expression of TRbeta and several genes encoding ion channels involved in cardiac contractile activity. Right after birth, when T3 concentration sharply increases, liganded TRalpha (holoreceptors) turn on the expression of some of these same genes concomitantly with heart rate increase. These data describe a physiological situation under which conversion of TRalpha from apo-receptors into holo-receptors, upon changes in T3 availability, plays a determinant role in a developmental process.
11237340	Enzymatic determination of homocysteine in cell extracts.	Determination of homocysteine levels in cells and serum is important because high homocysteine is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The currently used methods for homocysteine analysis either are time consuming or rely on the use of expensive equipment. Described in this study is an enzymatic assay that determines levels of homocysteine in multiple samples in less than 30 min at levels from 5 to 50 pmol using only a spectrophotometer. The reproducibility of the assay is consistent with the other methods currently used. A second assay, that is about 5-fold more sensitive, follows the enzymatic catalyzed solvent exchange of protons on glycine, which requires a scintillation counter. Both the spectrophotometric and the radiometric methods are based on the conversion of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate by methionine synthase. The tetrahydrofolate is formed in stoichiometric amounts to the homocysteine in the sample. In the spectrophotometric method the tetrahydrofolate is used at catalytic levels by three enzymes to form a metabolic cycle that generates NADPH from NADP(+). In the radiometric assay tetrahydrofolate is required for the enzymatic exchange of the pro 2S proton of glycine with solvent. L-Cysteine, at levels more than 30-fold higher than the upper level of homocysteine used in these assays, does not give any measurable response.
23330847	Hydroxy-terminated conjugated polymer nanoparticles have near-unity bright fraction and reveal cholesterol-dependence of IGF1R nanodomains.	Fluorescent nanoparticles have enabled many discoveries regarding how molecular machines function. Quantum dots have been the dominant class of fluorescent nanoparticles but suffer from blinking and from a substantial dark fraction--particles where the fluorescence is never seen--complicating any analysis of biological function. Nanoparticles composed of conjugated fluorescent polymers (Pdots) have recently been shown to have high brightness and no blinking. Here we develop a robust and efficient means to measure the dark fraction of Pdots, conjugating Atto dyes to the nanoparticles and testing fluorescence colocalization of dye and Pdot puncta. This established that the Pdots we generated had minimal dark fraction: ∼3%. The application of nanoparticles in biological environments is highly sensitive to surface functionalization. For Pdots we found that passivation with uncharged hydroxy-terminated polyethylene glycol caused a dramatic reduction in nonspecific cell binding and aggregation compared to a charged coating. Using carbonyl di-imidazole the hydroxy-Pdots were functionalized efficiently with streptavidin for high stability targeting, allowing specific labeling of mammalian cells. Type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R) regulates cell survival and development, with roles in aging, heart disease, and cancer. We used hydroxy-Pdots to track the dynamics of IGF1R on a breast cancer cell-line, determining the diffusion characteristics and showing cholesterol-containing membrane nanodomains were important for receptor mobility at the plasma membrane. The near-unity bright fraction and low nonspecific binding of hydroxy-Pdots, combined with Pdot photostability and lack of blinking, provides many advantages for investigations at the single molecule level.
23587648	Regulation of connexin hemichannel activity by membrane potential and the extracellular calcium in health and disease.	Connexins are thought to solely mediate cell-to-cell communication by forming gap junction channels composed of two membrane-spanning hemichannels positioned end-to-end. However, many if not all connexin isoforms also form functional hemichannels (i.e., the precursors of complete channels) that mediate the rapid exchange of ions, second messengers and metabolites between the cell interior and the interstitial space. Electrical and molecular signaling via connexin hemichannels is now widely recognized to be important in many physiological scenarios and pathological conditions. Indeed, mutations in connexins that alter hemichannel function have been implicated in several diseases. Here, we present a comprehensive overview of how hemichannel activity is tightly regulated by membrane potential and the external calcium concentration. In addition, we discuss the genetic mutations known to alter hemichannel function and their deleterious effects, of which a better understanding is necessary to develop novel therapeutic approaches for diseases caused by hemichannel dysfunction. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Connexin based channels'.
11103883	In-vivo assessment of 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C antagonistic properties of newer antipsychotics.	The effects of serotonin (5-HT) receptor ligands on the MK 212 (6-chloro-2[1-piperazinyl]pyrazine) discriminative stimulus and quipazine-induced head twitches were studied in rats. 5-HT1A (8-OH-DPAT) and preferential 5-HT2A (DOI) receptor agonists did not generalize to the discriminative stimulus. The 5-HT2B/2C-receptor antagonist, SB 206553 (5-methyl-1-(3-pyridylcarbamoyl)-1,2,3,5-tetrahydropyrrolo[2 ,3-f]indole), and the 5-HT2A/2C-receptor antagonist, ritanserin, acted as potent antagonists, whereas the 5-HT2A-receptor antagonist, MDL 100.151 ([(+/-)-alpha-(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-[2-(4-fluorophenylethyl)]-4- piperidine-methanol), produced minor and inconsistent inhibition. SB 206553 was a weak antagonist against quipazine-induced head twitches, whereas MDL 100.151 and ritanserin were potent antagonists. This suggests that the MK 212 discriminative stimulus is mediated by 5-HT2C receptors, while quipazine-induced head twitches are mediated primarily by 5-HT2A receptors. The effects on quipazine-induced head twitches were comparable to previously published effects on the DOI discriminative stimulus. 5-HT2A- and 5-HT2C-receptor antagonistic potencies of clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, sertindole and ziprasidone were compared in the same models. Clozapine showed similar potencies in both models, while sertindole, olanzapine and risperidone inhibited quipazine-induced effects more potently than the MK 212 discriminative stimulus. Ziprasidone exerted a minor preference for 5-HT2A- compared to 5-HT2C-receptor-mediated effects. The ratio between in vivo inhibitory potencies at 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors did not correlate with corresponding ratios from in-vitro affinity and ex-vivo occupancy studies in the literature.
23340252	The endocrine disrupting chemical tolylfluanid alters adipocyte metabolism via glucocorticoid receptor activation.	Glucocorticoid signaling plays a critical role in regulating energy metabolism. Emerging data implicate environmental endocrine-disrupting chemicals as contributors to the obesity and diabetes epidemics. Previous studies have shown that the phenylsulfamide fungicide tolylfluanid (TF) augments glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-dependent luciferase expression in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes while modulating insulin action in primary murine and human adipocytes. Studies were performed to interrogate glucocorticoid signaling in primary adipocytes exposed to TF. TF mimicked the gene transcription profile of the murine glucocorticoid corticosterone (Cort). Cellular fractionation assays demonstrated that TF treatment promoted the activating serine phosphorylation of GR, augmenting its cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation as well as its enrichment at glucocorticoid response elements on the glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper gene promoter. After acute treatment, Cort or TF promoted insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) gene and protein expression. Either treatment also enriched GR binding at an identified glucocorticoid response element in the IRS-1 gene. TF or Cort each increased insulin-stimulated lipogenesis, an effect resulting from increased lipogenic gene expression and enhanced insulin-stimulated dephosphorylation of acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase. The augmentation of insulin-stimulated lipogenesis was mediated through a specific enhancement of Akt phosphorylation at T308. These findings support modulation of IRS-1 levels as a mechanism for glucocorticoid-mediated changes in insulin action in primary adipocytes. Albeit with less affinity than Cort, in silico analysis suggests that TF can interact with the ligand binding pocket of GR. Collectively, these studies identify TF as a structurally unique environmental glucocorticoid. Glucocorticoid signaling may thus represent a novel pathway by which environmental toxicants promote the development of metabolic diseases.
23394555	Thymidylate kinase: an old topic brings new perspectives.	Thymidylate kinase (TMPK) is a key enzyme for pyrimidine synthesis that catalyzes the phosphorylation of thymidine 5'-monophosphate (dTMP) in the presence of ATP and Mg(2+) to form thymidine 5'-diphosphate (dTDP), which is then converted to thymidine 5'-triphosphate (dTTP) by nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (NDK). TMPK has an important function in cell proliferation and its enzyme kinetics and related structures have been determined in various organisms. TMPK is well recognized as a potential drug target, with the most notable function being in the activation of anti-HIV nucleoside prodrugs. Recent studies have shown that TMPK is a validated target for antibiotic development against gram-positive bacterium of Staphylococcus aureus. In addition, inhibition of human TMPK increases the potential of anticancer agent doxorubicin toward colon cancer cells regardless of p53 status. Following the rapid expanding knowledge on TMPKs and the rising interests in TMPKs as a drug target, in this review we try to describe current research on TMPKs in various organisms of eukaryotes, prokaryotes and viruses and to provide information for designing new potential inhibitors against TMPKs.
17194761	Structure of aspartoacylase, the brain enzyme impaired in Canavan disease.	Aspartoacylase catalyzes hydrolysis of N-acetyl-l-aspartate to aspartate and acetate in the vertebrate brain. Deficiency in this activity leads to spongiform degeneration of the white matter of the brain and is the established cause of Canavan disease, a fatal progressive leukodystrophy affecting young children. We present crystal structures of recombinant human and rat aspartoacylase refined to 2.8- and 1.8-A resolution, respectively. The structures revealed that the N-terminal domain of aspartoacylase adopts a protein fold similar to that of zinc-dependent hydrolases related to carboxypeptidases A. The catalytic site of aspartoacylase shows close structural similarity to those of carboxypeptidases despite only 10-13% sequence identity between these proteins. About 100 C-terminal residues of aspartoacylase form a globular domain with a two-stranded beta-sheet linker that wraps around the N-terminal domain. The long channel leading to the active site is formed by the interface of the N- and C-terminal domains. The C-terminal domain is positioned in a way that prevents productive binding of polypeptides in the active site. The structures revealed that residues 158-164 may undergo a conformational change that results in opening and partial closing of the channel entrance. We hypothesize that the catalytic mechanism of aspartoacylase is closely analogous to that of carboxypeptidases. We identify residues involved in zinc coordination, and propose which residues may be involved in substrate binding and catalysis. The structures also provide a structural framework necessary for understanding the deleterious effects of many missense mutations of human aspartoacylase.
11350861	The broad-spectrum anti-emetic activity of AS-8112, a novel dopamine D2, D3 and 5-HT3 receptors antagonist.	The anti-emetic and pharmacological profile of AS-8112 ((R)-5-bromo-N-(1-ethyl-4-methylhexahydro-1H-1,4-diazepin-6-yl)-2-methoxy-6-methy lamino-3-pyridinecarboxamide.2 fumarate), a novel and potent dopamine D2, D3 and 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) receptors ligand, was investigated in the present study. In guinea-pig isolated colon, AS-8112 produced a rightward shift of the concentration-response curves of 2-methyl-5HT, a 5-HT3 receptor agonist (pA2 value of 7.04). Other 5-HT3 receptor antagonists also produced such a shift in the following antagonistic-potency order: granisetron> ondansetron=AS-8112>>metoclopramide. In mice, AS-8112 (1.0 - 3.0 mg kg(-1) s.c.) potently inhibited hypothermia induced by the dopamine D3 receptor agonist; R(+)-7-OH-DPAT (R(+)-7-hydroxy-2-(N,N-di-n-propylamino)tetraline) (0.3 mg kg(-1) s.c.). Domperidone and haloperidol, which have affinity for dopamine D3 receptor, also inhibited R(+)-7-OH-DPAT-induced hypothermia. In ferrets or dogs, AS-8112 dose-dependently inhibited emesis induced by R(+)-7-OH-DPAT, apomorphine, morphine or cisplatin with ID50 values of 2.22 microg kg(-1) s.c., 10.5 microg kg(-1) s.c., 14.2 microg kg(-1) i.v. and 17.6 microg kg(-1) i.v., respectively. Moreover, oral administration of AS-8112 significantly inhibited emesis induced by these emetogens. AS-8112 (0.3 mg kg(-1) i.v.) significantly inhibited emesis induced by cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin. In conclusion, AS-8112 is a potent dopamine D2, D3 and 5-HT3 receptors antagonist, and a novel anti-emetic agent with a broad-spectrum of anti-emetic activity. These results suggest that this compound is worthy of clinical investigation.
16801455	Mitochondrial arginase II modulates nitric-oxide synthesis through nonfreely exchangeable L-arginine pools in human endothelial cells.	Reduced synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) contributes to the endothelial dysfunction and may be related to limited availability of L-arginine, the common substrate of constitutive nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) and cytosolic arginase I and mitochondrial arginase II. To determine whether arginases modulate the endothelial NO synthesis, we investigated the effects of the competitive arginase inhibitor N(omega)-hydroxy-nor-L-arginine (Nor-NOHA) on the activity of NOS, arginases, and L-arginine transporter and on NO release at surface of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In unstimulated cells, Nor-NOHA dose-dependently reduced the arginase activity with maximal inhibition at 20 microM. When HUVECs were stimulated by thrombin without extracellular L-arginine, Nor-NOHA dose-dependently increased the NOS activity and the NO release with maximal effects at 20 microM. Extracellular L-arginine also dose-dependently increased NO release and arginase activity. When HUVECs were stimulated by thrombin in the presence of 100 microM L-arginine, NOS activity and NO release were similar in untreated and Nor-NOHA-treated cells. However, despite activation of L-arginine uptake, the inhibition of arginase activity by Nor-NOHA was still significant. The depletion of freely exchangeable L-arginine pools with extracellular L-lysine did not prevent Nor-NOHA from increasing the NO release. This indicates the presence of pools, which are accessible to NOS and arginase, but not exchangeable. Interestingly, the mitochondrial arginase II was constitutively expressed, whereas the cytosolic arginase I was barely detectable in HUVECs. These data suggest that endothelial NO synthesis depends on the activity of arginase II in mitochondria and l-arginine carriers in cell membrane.
23270990	The interactions of apamin and tetraethylammonium are differentially affected by single mutations in the pore mouth of small conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels.	Valine residues in the pore region of SK2 (V366) and SK3 (V520) were replaced by either an alanine or a phenylalanine to evaluate the impact on the interactions with the allosteric blocker apamin. Unlike TEA which showed high sensitivity to phenylalanine mutated channels, the binding affinity of apamin to the phenylalanine mutants was strongly reduced. In addition, currents from phenylalanine mutants were largely resistant to block by apamin. On the other hand, when the valine residue was replaced by an alanine residue, an increase of the binding affinity and the amount of block by apamin was observed for alanine mutated SK2 channels, but not for mutated SK3 channels. Interestingly, the VA mutation reduced the sensitivity to TEA. In silico data confirmed these experimental results. Therefore, such mutations in the pore region of SK channels show that the three-dimensional structure of the SK tetramers can be disorganized in the outer pore region leading to reduced interaction of apamin with its target.
23562496	2-Hydroxychalcone and xanthohumol inhibit invasion of triple negative breast cancer cells.	Breast cancer is estimated as one of the most common causes of cancer death among women. In particular, triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs), which do not express the genes for estrogen/progesterone receptors (ER/PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), have been associated with poor prognosis and metastasis. Chalcones, the biosynthetic precursors of flavonoids present in edible plants, exert cytotoxic and chemopreventive activities. Although mounting evidence suggests the anticancer properties of chalcones, limited information is available regarding the inhibitory effects of chalcones on the aggressiveness of breast cancer cells. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of chalcone and its derivatives on the growth and the invasiveness of TNBC cells. Here, we showed that treatment with chalcone, 2-hydroxychalcone, and xanthohumol for 24h inhibited the growth of MDA-MB-231cells with IC50 values of 18.1, 4.6, and 6.7μM, respectively. Similarly, Chalcone, 2-hydroxychalcone, and xanthohumol also exerted cytotoxicity in another TNBC cell line, Hs578T. Neohesperidin dihydrochalcone, 4-methoxychalcone, and hesperidin methylchalcone did not show the cytotoxicity on the MDA-MB-231cells. Xanthohumol and 2-hydroxychalcone induced apoptosis by Bcl-2 downregulation. Importantly, 2-hydroxychalcone and xanthohumol exerted more potent inhibitory effects on the proliferation, MMP-9 expression and invasive phenotype of MDA-MB-231 than chalcone. These results suggest a potential application of these chalcones as anticancer agents that can alleviate malignant progression of TNBC.
23235156	70-kDa heat shock cognate protein hsc70 mediates calmodulin-dependent nuclear import of the sex-determining factor SRY.	We recently showed that the developmentally important family of SOX (SRY (sex determining region on the Y chromosome)-related high mobility group (HMG) box) proteins require the calcium-binding protein calmodulin (CaM) for optimal nuclear accumulation, with clinical mutations in SRY that specifically impair nuclear accumulation via this pathway resulting in XY sex reversal. However, the mechanism by which CaM facilitates nuclear accumulation is unknown. Here, we show, for the first time, that the 70-kDa heat shock cognate protein hsc70 plays a key role in CaM-dependent nuclear import of SRY. Using a reconstituted nuclear import assay, we show that antibodies to hsc70 significantly reduce nuclear accumulation of wild type SRY and mutant derivatives thereof that retain CaM-dependent nuclear import, with an increased rate of nuclear accumulation upon addition of both CaM and hsc70, in contrast to an SRY mutant derivative with impaired CaM binding. siRNA knockdown of hsc70 in intact cells showed similar results, indicating clear dependence upon hsc70 for CaM-dependent nuclear import. Analysis using the technique of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching indicated that hsc70 is required for the maximal rate of SRY nuclear import in living cells but has no impact upon SRY nuclear retention/nuclear dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate direct binding of hsc70 to the SRY·CaM complex, with immunoprecipitation experiments from cell extracts showing association of hsc70 with wild type SRY, but not with a mutant derivative with impaired CaM binding, dependent on Ca(2+). Our novel findings strongly implicate hsc70 in CaM-dependent nuclear import of SRY.
23410129	Recurrent rearrangements in prostate cancer: causes and therapeutic potential.	DNA damage and genetic rearrangements are hallmarks of cancer. However, gene fusions as driver mutations in cancer have classically been a distinction in leukemia and other rare instances until recently with the discovery of gene fusion events occurring in 50 to 75% of prostate cancer patients. The discovery of the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion sparked an onslaught of discovery and innovation resulting in a delineation of prostate cancer via a molecular signature of gene fusion events. The increased commonality of high-throughput sequencing data coupled with improved bioinformatics approaches not only elucidated the molecular underpinnings of prostate cancer progression, but the mechanisms of gene fusion biogenesis. Interestingly, the androgen receptor (AR), already known to play a significant role in prostate cancer tumorigenesis, has recently been implicated in the processes resulting in gene fusions by inducing the spatial proximity of genes involved in rearrangements, promoting the formation of double-strand DNA breaks (DSB), and facilitating the recruitment of proteins for non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). Our increased understanding of the mechanisms inducing genomic instability may lead to improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. To date, the majority of prostate cancer patients can be molecularly stratified based on their gene fusion status thereby increasing the potential for tailoring more specific and effective therapies.
22846225	Matching biochemical and functional efficacies confirm ZIP as a potent competitive inhibitor of PKMζ in neurons.	PKMζ is an autonomously active, atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) isoform that is both necessary and sufficient for maintaining long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term memory. The myristoylated ζ-pseudosubstrate peptide, ZIP, potently inhibits PKMζ biochemically in vitro, within cultured cells, and within neurons in hippocampal slices, and reverses LTP maintenance and erases long-term memory storage. A recent study (Wu-Zhang et al., 2012), however, suggested ZIP was not effective on a PKMζ fusion protein overexpressed in cultured cells. Chelerythrine, a redox-sensitive PKC inhibitor that inhibits PKMζ and disrupts LTP maintenance and memory storage, was also reported by Wu-Zhang et al. (2012) not to inhibit the expressed PKMζ fusion protein. However, the efficacy of inhibitors on endogenous enzymes in cells may not be adequately assessed in expression systems in which levels of expression of exogenous enzymes greatly exceed those of endogenous enzymes. Thus, we show, biochemically, that when PKMζ reaches a level beyond that necessary for substrate phosphorylation such that much of the enzyme is excess or 'spare' kinase, ZIP and chelerythrine do not effectively block substrate phosphorylation. We also show that the cellular overexpression techniques used by Wu-Zhang et al. (2012) increase kinase levels ~30-40 fold above normal levels in transfected cells. Using a mathematical model we show that at such level of overexpression, standard concentrations of inhibitor should have no noticeable effect. Furthermore, we demonstrate the standard concentrations of ZIP, but not scrambled ZIP, inhibit the ability of PKMζ to potentiate AMPAR responses at postsynaptic sites, the physiological function of the kinase. Wu-Zhang et al. (2012) had also claimed that staurosporine, a general kinase inhibitor that does not effectively inhibit PKMζ biochemically in vitro, nonetheless indirectly blocked the PKMζ fusion protein overexpressed in cultured cells by inhibiting phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1). However, here we show that staurosporine does not affect PDK1 phosphorylation of the endogenous PKMζ in hippocampal slices. Thus, the biochemical in vitro effects of PKMζ inhibitors correspond with their intracellular effects, and ZIP and chelerythrine, together with scrambled ZIP and staurosporine as controls, are effective tools to examine the function of PKMζ in neurons. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Cognitive Enhancers'.
11791081	Progestogens in hormonal replacement therapy: new molecules, risks, and benefits.	While the benefits of progestogen use in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) are well recognized as far as endometrial protection is concerned, their risks and drawbacks have generated controversial articles. Several risks are attributed to progestogens as a class-effect; however, the progestogens used in HRT have varying pharmacological properties and do not induce the same side effects. Natural progesterone (P) and some of its derivatives, such as the 19-norprogesterones (Nestorone, nomegestrol acetate, trimegestone), do not bind to the androgen receptor and, hence, do not exert androgenic side effects. Newly synthesized molecules such as drospirenone or dienogest have no androgenic effect but do have a partial antiandrogenic effect. Drospirenone derives from spironolactone and binds to the mineralocorticoid receptor. When the cardiovascular risk factors are considered, some molecules with a higher androgenic potency than others attenuate the beneficial effects of estrogens on the lipid profile as well as the vasomotion. On the other hand, other progestogens devoid of androgenic properties do not exert these deleterious effects. The epidemiological data do not suggest any negative effect of the progestogens administered together with estrogens on cardiovascular morbidity or mortality. However, recent results suggest that in women with established coronary heart disease, HRT may not protect against further heart attacks when the progestogen selected possesses androgenic properties. The data related to the progestogen effect on breast tissue has been interpreted differently from country to country. However, it has been admitted that, according to the type of progestogen used and the dose and duration of its application, a predominant antiproliferative effect is observed in the human breast cells. As far as breast cancer risk is concerned, most epidemiological studies do not suggest any significant difference between the estrogens given alone or combined with progestogens in HRT. Complying with the classic contraindications of HRT and selecting molecules devoid of estrogenic, androgenic, or glucocorticoid effect should allow a larger use of the progestins without any major drawback.
23143674	Using chimeric mice with humanized livers to predict human drug metabolism and a drug-drug interaction.	Interspecies differences in drug metabolism have made it difficult to use preclinical animal testing data to predict the drug metabolites or potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) that will occur in humans. Although chimeric mice with humanized livers can produce known human metabolites for test substrates, we do not know whether chimeric mice can be used to prospectively predict human drug metabolism or a possible DDI. Therefore, we investigated whether they could provide a more predictive assessment for clemizole, a drug in clinical development for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that analyses performed in chimeric mice can correctly identify the predominant human drug metabolite before human testing. The differences in the rodent and human pathways for clemizole metabolism were of importance, because the predominant human metabolite was found to have synergistic anti-HCV activity. Moreover, studies in chimeric mice also correctly predicted that a DDI would occur in humans when clemizole was coadministered with a CYP3A4 inhibitor. These results demonstrate that using chimeric mice can improve the quality of preclinical drug assessment.
11885959	Differential binding mode of diverse cyclooxygenase inhibitors.	Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are competitive inhibitors of cyclooxygenase (COX), the enzyme that mediates biosynthesis of prostaglandins and thromboxanes from arachidonic acid. There are at least two different isoforms of the enzyme known as COX-1 and -2. Site directed mutagenesis studies suggest that non-selective COX inhibitors of diverse chemical families exhibit differential binding modes to the two isozymes. These results cannot clearly be explained from the sole analysis of the crystal structures of COX available from X-ray diffraction studies. With the aim to elucidate the structural features governing the differential inhibitory binding behavior of these inhibitors, molecular modeling studies were undertaken to generate atomic models compatible with the experimental data available. Accordingly, docking of different COX inhibitors, including selective and non-selective ligands: rofecoxib, ketoprofen, suprofen, carprofen, zomepirac, indomethacin, diclofenac and meclofenamic acid were undertaken using the AMBER program. The results of the present study provide new insights into a better understanding of the differential binding mode of diverse families of COX inhibitors, and are expected to contribute to the design of new selective compounds.
10755406	A unique cytosolic activity related but distinct from NQO1 catalyses metabolic activation of mitomycin C.	Mitomycin C (MMC) is a prototype bioreductive drug employed to treat a variety of cancers including head and neck cancer. Among the various enzymes, dicoumarol inhibitable cytosolic NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase1 (NQO1) was shown to catalyse bioreductive activation of MMC leading to cross-linking of the DNA and cytotoxicity. However, the role of NQO1 in metabolic activation of MMC has been disputed. In this report, we present cellular and animal models to demonstrate that NQO1 may play only a minor role in metabolic activation of MMC. We further demonstrate that bioreductive activation of MMC is catalysed by a unique cytosolic activity which is related but distinct from NQO1. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were developed that permanently express higher levels of cDNA-derived NQO1. These cells showed significantly increased protection against menadione toxicity. However, they failed to demonstrate higher cytotoxicity due to exposure to MMC under oxygen (normal air) or hypoxia, as compared to the wild-type control CHO cells. Disruption of the NQO1 gene by homologous recombination generated NQO1-/- mice that do not express the NQO1 gene resulting in the loss of NQO1 protein and activity. The cytosolic fractions from liver and colon tissues of NQO1-/- mice showed similar amounts of DNA cross-linking upon exposure to MMC, as observed in NQO1+/+ mice. The unique cytosolic activity that activated MMC in cytosolic fractions of liver and colon tissues of NQO1-/- mice was designated as cytosolic MMC reductase. This activity, like NQO1, was inhibited by dicoumarol and immunologically related to NQO1.
23201179	Aggression- and sex-induced neural activity across vasotocin populations in the brown anole.	Activity within the social behavior neural network is modulated by the neuropeptide arginine vasotocin (AVT) and its mammalian homologue arginine vasopressin (AVP). However, central AVT/AVP release causes different behavioral effects across species and social environments. These differences may be due to the activation of different neuronal AVT/AVP populations or to similar activity patterns causing different behavioral outputs. We examined neural activity (assessed as Fos induction) within AVT neurons in male brown anole lizards (Anolis sagrei) participating in aggressive or sexual encounters. Lizards possess simple amniote nervous systems, and their examination provides a comparative framework to complement avian and mammalian studies. In accordance with findings in other species, AVT neurons in the anole paraventricular nucleus (PVN) were activated during aggressive encounters; but unlike in other species, a positive correlation was found between aggression levels and activation. Activation of AVT neurons within the supraoptic nucleus (SON) occurred nonspecifically with participation in either aggressive or sexual encounters. Activation of AVT neurons in the preoptic area (POA) and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) was associated with engagement in sexual behaviors. The above findings are congruent with neural activation patterns observed in other species, even when the behavioral outputs (i.e., aggression level) differed. However, aggressive encounters also increased activation of AVT neurons in the BNST, which is incongruous with findings in other species. Thus, some species differences involve the encoding of social stimuli as different neural activation patterns within the AVT/AVP network, whereas other behavioral differences arise downstream of this system.
23564645	Detection of Statin Cytotoxicity Is Increased in Cells Expressing the OATP1B1 Transporter.	Cytotoxicity of a compound is determined by the intracellular concentration mediated both by passive permeability and active uptake through drug transporters. However, the major liver uptake transporters were either absent or expressed at significantly lower levels in human liver cell lines than in human liver. When comparing cytotoxicity of five statins, the organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) expressing HEK cells showed a significantly higher sensitivity than the wild-type HEK cells. The IC50 shifts ranged from 9- to >100-fold, and the potency shifts collapsed in the presence of rifampicin, the inhibitor for OATPs. The extent of the IC50 shift correlated with the permeability of the statins with high permeable compounds having smaller shifts and low permeable compounds having larger shifts. The changes in statin potency in transporter transfected cells reflect the active uptake of statins into the cells and the increased intracellular drug concentration lead to increased toxicity. The data suggested that uptake transporters have a significant impact on the outcomes of a cell-based assay and should be considered during the early stages of compound toxicity screening in drug discovery. For compounds with low permeability which are likely to undergo transporter-mediated uptake, it is important to test them in transporter-competent cell models.
1438284	Conversion of acetylcholinesterase to butyrylcholinesterase: modeling and mutagenesis.	"Torpedo acetylcholinesterase (AcChoEase, EC 3.1.1.7) and human butyrylcholinesterase (BtChoEase, EC 3.1.1.8), while clearly differing in substrate specificity and sensitivity to inhibitors, possess 53% sequence homology; this permitted modeling human BtChoEase on the basis of the three-dimensional structure of Torpedo AcChoEase. The modeled BtChoEase structure closely resembled that of AcChoEase in overall features. However, six conserved aromatic residues that line the active-site gorge, which is a prominent feature of the AcChoEase structure, are absent in BtChoEase. Modeling showed that two such residues, Phe-288 and Phe-290, replaced by leucine and valine, respectively, in BtChoEase, may prevent entrance of butyrylcholine into the acyl-binding pocket. Their mutation to leucine and valine in AcChoEase, by site-directed mutagenesis, produced a double mutant that hydrolyzed butyrylthiocholine almost as well as acetylthiocholine. The mutated enzyme was also inhibited well by the bulky, BtChoEase-selective organophosphate inhibitor (tetraisopropylpyrophosphoramide, iso-OMPA). Trp-279, at the entrance of the active-site gorge in AcChoEase, is absent in BtChoEase. Modeling designated it as part of the ""peripheral"" anionic site, which is lacking in BtChoEase. The mutant W279A displayed strongly reduced inhibition by the peripheral site-specific ligand propidium relative to wild-type Torpedo AcChoEase, whereas inhibition by the catalytic-site inhibitor edrophonium was unaffected."
23276728	Potential antipsoriatic effect of chondroitin sulfate through inhibition of NF-κB and STAT3 in human keratinocytes.	Chondroitin sulfate (CS) is a natural glycosaminoglycan, formed by the 1-3 linkage of d-glucuronic acid to N-acetylgalactosamine, present in the extracellular matrix. It is used as a slow acting disease modifying agent in the treatment of osteoarthritis, and part of its beneficial effects are due to its antiinflammatory properties that result from an inhibitory effect on NF-κB signaling pathway. This ability raises the hypothesis that CS might be effective in other chronic inflammatory processes such as psoriasis, in which a deregulation of NF-κB is a key feature. In addition, psoriasis is characterized by an upregulation of STAT3 signaling pathway that is related to the epidermal hyperplasia. In the present study we report the pharmacological modulation of the NF-κB and STAT3 signaling pathways by CS in normal human keratinocytes. CS inhibited NF-κB activation and the release of some of the key psoriatic cytokines such as TNFα, IL-8, IL-6 and CCL27. Moreover, it impaired STAT3 translocation to the nucleus and significantly reduced STAT3 transcriptional activity by a mechanism that was independent from STAT3 phosphorylation. Our results confirm the interest of CS as a candidate for future drug research in the therapeutics of psoriasis given the need of more effective and safer oral medications for these patients.
23085121	Cholinesterase confabs and cousins: Approaching forty years.	In the past four decades of cholinesterase (ChE) research, we have seen substantive evolution of the field from one centered around substrate and inhibitor kinetic profiles and compound characterizations to the analysis of ChE structure, first through the gene families and then by X-ray crystallographic determinations of the free enzymes and their complexes and conjugates. Indeed, these endeavors have been facilitated by recombinant DNA technologies, structure determinations and parallel studies in related proteins in the α/β-hydrolase fold family. This approach has not only contributed to a fundamental understanding of structure and function of a large family of hydrolase-like proteins possessing functions other than catalysis, but also has been used to develop new practical strategies for scavenging and antidotal activity in cases of organophosphate insecticide or nerve agent exposure.
23337911	Toxicity assessment on trophoblast cells for some environment polluting chemicals and 17β-estradiol.	The identification of reproductive toxicants is a major scientific challenge for human health. We investigated the effects of a selected group of environmental polluting chemicals mostly provided with estrogenic activity on the human trophoblast cell lines BeWo and HTR-8/SVneo. Cells were exposed for 24h to various concentrations (from 0.1 pM to 1 mM) of atrazine (ATR), diethylstilbestrol (DES), para-nonylphenol (p-NP), resveratrol (RES) and 17 β-estradiol (E2) and assayed for cell viability and human beta-Chorionic Gonadotropin (β-hCG) secretion. Decrease of cell viability as respect to control, vehicle-treated, cultures was obtained for all chemicals in the concentration range of 1 μM-1 mM in both cell types. A parallel decrease of β-hCG secretion was observed in BeWo cells, at 1 μM-1 mM concentrations, with the only exception of ATR which caused an increase at concentrations up to 1mM. β-hCG release was also unexpectedly inhibited by ATR, DES, p-NP and RES at non-toxic (pM-nM) concentrations. These findings raise concern about the negative, potential effects of various environmental polluting chemicals on pregnancy success and fetal health.
19610651	Small molecule chloropyramine hydrochloride (C4) targets the binding site of focal adhesion kinase and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 and suppresses breast cancer growth in vivo.	FAK is a tyrosine kinase that functions as a key orchestrator of signals leading to invasion and metastasis. Since FAK interacts directly with a number of critical proteins involved in survival signaling in tumor cells, we hypothesized that targeting a key protein-protein interface with druglike small molecules was a feasible strategy for inhibiting tumor growth. In this study, we targeted the protein-protein interface between FAK and VEGFR-3 and identified compound C4 (chloropyramine hydrochloride) as a drug capable of (1) inhibiting the biochemical function of VEGFR-3 and FAK, (2) inhibiting proliferation of a diverse set of cancer cell types in vitro, and (3) reducing tumor growth in vivo. Chloropyramine hydrochloride reduced tumor growth as a single agent, while concomitant administration with doxorubicin had a pronounced synergistic effect. Our data demonstrate that the FAK-VEGFR-3 interaction can be targeted by small druglike molecules and this interaction can provide the basis for highly specific novel cancer therapeutics.
23578608	Role of plant stanol derivatives in the modulation of cholesterol metabolism and liver gene expression in mice.	The present study was to evaluate the cholesterol-lowering effect of two novel plant stanol derivatives and its potential molecular mechanism in hyper-cholesterol mice induced by a high-cholesterol diet. Results showed that oral administration of plant stanyl hemisuccinate (2×, 5×) and plant stanyl sorbitol succinate (2×, 5×) effectively attenuated the serum total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, while had no effect on the serum triacylglycerol and high density lipoprotein cholesterol. And plant stanol derivatives decreased liver cholesterol concentration and increased faecal cholesterol output. Meanwhile, both plant stanyl hemisuccinate and plant stanyl sorbitol succinate could remarkably promote liver X receptor alpha (LXRα) expression, and increased cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) expression and faecal total bile acid output to varying degrees. These results suggested two novel plant stanol derivatives possessed hypocholesterolemic effect, and the cholesterol-lowering action of plant stanol derivatives may be through activating the potential LXRα-CYP7A1-bile acid excretion pathway.
23397510	Prolactin and sex steroids levels in congenital lifetime isolated GH deficiency.	Growth hormone (GH) and prolactin share similarities in structure and function. We have previously shown that women with congenital isolated GH deficiency (IGHD) caused by a homozygous mutation in the GHRH receptor gene (GHRHR) (MUT/MUT) have a short reproductive life, with anticipated climacteric. At climacteric, they have lower prolactin levels than normal controls (N/N). Because they are able to breast feed, we hypothesized that this prolactin reduction is limited to climacteric, as result of lower estradiol exposure of the lactotrophs. The purposes of this work were to assess prolactin levels in broader age adults homozygous and heterozygous (MUT/N) for the mutation and in normal controls (N/N), and to correlate them to sex steroids levels. We enrolled 24 GH-naïve MUT/MUT (12 female), 25 MUT/N (14 female), and 25 N/N (11 female) subjects, aged 25-65 years. Anthropometric data and serum prolactin, estradiol, total testosterone, and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) were measured. Free testosterone was calculated. Prolactin levels were similar in the three groups. In males, testosterone and SHBG levels were higher in MUT/MUT in comparison to N/N. There was no difference in free testosterone among groups. In all 74 individuals, prolactin correlated inversely with age (p < 0.0001) and directly with serum estradiol (p = 0.018). Prolactin levels in subjects with IGHD due to a homozygous GHRHR mutation are similar to heterozygous and normal homozygous, but total testosterone and SHBG are higher in male MUT/MUT, with no difference in free testosterone. The reduced prolactin level is limited to climacteric period, possibly due to reduced estrogen exposure.
17559874	The structure of serine palmitoyltransferase; gateway to sphingolipid biosynthesis.	Sphingolipid biosynthesis commences with the condensation of L-serine and palmitoyl-CoA to produce 3-ketodihydrosphingosine (KDS). This reaction is catalysed by the PLP-dependent enzyme serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT; EC 2.3.1.50), which is a membrane-bound heterodimer (SPT1/SPT2) in eukaryotes such as humans and yeast and a cytoplasmic homodimer in the Gram-negative bacterium Sphingomonas paucimobilis. Unusually, the outer membrane of S. paucimobilis contains glycosphingolipid (GSL) instead of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and SPT catalyses the first step of the GSL biosynthetic pathway in this organism. We report here the crystal structure of the holo-form of S. paucimobilis SPT at 1.3 A resolution. The enzyme is a symmetrical homodimer with two active sites and a monomeric tertiary structure consisting of three domains. The PLP cofactor is bound covalently to a lysine residue (Lys265) as an internal aldimine/Schiff base and the active site is composed of residues from both subunits, located at the bottom of a deep cleft. Models of the human SPT1/SPT2 heterodimer were generated from the bacterial structure by bioinformatics analysis. Mutations in the human SPT1-encoding subunit have been shown to cause a neuropathological disease known as hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type I (HSAN1). Our models provide an understanding of how these mutations may affect the activity of the enzyme.
23298258	All-trans retinoic acid protects hepatocellular carcinoma cells against serum-starvation-induced cell death by upregulating collagen 8A2.	As a therapeutic or chemopreventative agent for various cancers, all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) has been reported to inhibit growth, induce apoptosis or cause differentiation. It was found that atRA could protect hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells against cell death induced by serum starvation. Furthermore, it was found that atRA could enhance cell adhesion, but had no effect on the cell cycle and apoptosis. Using an Illumina Human HT-12 v4 expression microarray, 207 upregulated and 173 downregulated genes were identified in HepG2 cells treated with atRA. The most upregulated genes are cytochrome P450 family 26 subfamily A polypeptide 1 (CYP26A1), histidine triad nucleotide binding protein 3 (HINT3), miR-1282 and cytochrome P450 family 26 subfamily B polypeptide 1 (CYP26B1), which showed more than fivefold greater expression. Using Gene Ontology analysis, the greatest significance was found in extracellular-matrix-related molecular functions and the cellular component in upregulated genes. The upregulation of collagen 8A2 (COL8A2) was further confirmed using quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting. Knockdown of COL8A2 blocked enhancement in the early stage of cell adhesion by atRA treatment. Re-expression of COL8A2 in COL8A2-knocked-down HCC cells reversed the effect of small interfering RNA-COL8A2. In addition, COL8A2 could increase HCC cell migration and invasion. Thus, COL8A2 was identified as the key protein involved in the enhancement of cell adhesion of atRA under serum-free conditions. In conclusion, atRA protects HCC cells against serum-starvation-induced cell death by enhancing cell adhesion, and COL8A2 plays an important role in HCC cell migration and invasion.
17600786	A fluorescent polymeric heparin sensor.	Linear copolymers have been developed which carry binding sites tailored for sulfated sugars. All binding monomers are based on the methacrylamide skeleton and ensure statistical radical copolymerization. They are decorated with o-aminomethylphenylboronates for covalent ester formation and/or alkylammonium ions for noncovalent Coulomb attraction. Alcohol sidechains maintain a high water solubility; a dansyl monomer was constructed as a fluorescence label. Statistical copolymerization of comonomer mixtures with optimized ratios was started by AIBN (AIBN=2,2'-azoisobutyronitrile) and furnished water-soluble comonomers with an exceptionally high affinity for glucosaminoglucans. Heparin can be quantitatively detected with an unprecedented 30 nM sensitivity, and a neutral polymer without any ammonium cation is still able to bind the target with almost micromolar affinity. From this unexpected result, we propose a new binding scheme between the boronate and a sulfated ethylene glycol or aminoethanol unit. Although the mechanism of heparin binding involves covalent boronate ester formation, it can be completely reversed by protamine addition, similar to heparin's complex formation with antithrombin III.
23210783	From traditional European medicine to discovery of new drug candidates for the treatment of dementia and Alzheimer's disease: acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.	The leading Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapeutics to date involves inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which should, in principle, elevate cholinergic signaling and limit inflammation. In spite of the effectiveness in 20%-30% of AD patients, more attention has been paid to find new anti-AChE agents from medicinal plants. Galanthamine, contained in the bulbs and flowers of Galanthus and related genera like Narcissus, represents a good example. The aim of this study is to review the role of possible AChE inhibitors (AChEI) present in plants traditionally used in European medicine for improving memory. Starting from Galanthamine, properties of Melissa species, Salvia officinalis, Arnica chamissonis and Ruta graveolens are discussed to point to the role of these plants as potential sources for the development of therapeutic agents for AD.
10381812	Expression of multiple alpha1-adrenoceptors on vascular smooth muscle: correlation with the regulation of contraction.	Previous work has shown that the genes encoding each alpha1-adrenoceptor subtype are coexpressed throughout the peripheral vascular system. We have evaluated subtype-selective antibodies as tools to determine the extent of protein expression in arteries. The alpha1A-, alpha1B-, and alpha1D-adrenoceptors were detected in the medial layer of the aorta, caudal, femoral, iliac, renal, superior mesenteric, and mesenteric resistance arteries. In Rat1 fibroblasts expressing each subtype, immunoreactivity was noted both on the cell surface and in a perinuclear orientation. Intense alpha1B-adrenoceptor immunostaining was similarly localized in cultured femoral and renal vascular smooth muscle cells. Although the cellular localization appeared to be the same, immunoreactivity obtained with alpha1A- and alpha1D-adrenoceptors was much less intense than that with the alpha1B-adrenoceptor. The alpha1A-adrenoceptor selective agonist A-61603 was 22-fold more potent in activating renal artery contraction when compared with the femoral artery. The expression of each alpha1-adrenoceptor was significantly decreased by in vivo application of antisense oligonucleotides targeted against each subtype. Inhibition of the expression of only one, the alpha1A in renal and the alpha1D in femoral arteries, reduced the contractile response to naphazoline. The results show: 1) subtype-selective antibodies can be used in tissues and cell culture to localize the alpha1-adrenoceptor subtypes, 2) in addition to expression on the cell surface, the alpha1-adrenoceptors are expressed intracellularly, and 3) despite expression of all adrenoceptors, a single subtype mediates the contractile response in the femoral and renal arteries.
23229056	Synthesis and antibacterial evaluation of novel 11,4″-disubstituted azithromycin analogs with greatly improved activity against erythromycin-resistant bacteria.	A series of novel 11,4″-disubstituted azithromycin analogs were synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial activity. All the 11,4″-disubstituted analogs exhibited excellent activity (0.03-0.12 μg/ml) against erythromycin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, and significantly improved activity against three phenotypes of erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae compared with erythromycin A, clarithromycin or azithromycin. Among them, compounds 26-28 showed the most potent activity (0.25, 0.03 and 2 μg/ml) against S. pneumoniae expressing the erm gene, the mef gene and the erm and mef genes, respectively. In addition, compound 28 was the most effective (0.03 and 0.12 μg/ml) against erythromycin-susceptible S. pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus as well. It is noteworthy that the most active compounds described above possess the same terminal 3,5-dinitrophenyl groups on their C-4″ bisamide side chains.
23429263	Intracellular localization of the BCL-2 family member BOK and functional implications.	The pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family member BOK is widely expressed and resembles the multi-BH domain proteins BAX and BAK based on its amino acid sequence. The genomic region encoding BOK was reported to be frequently deleted in human cancer and it has therefore been hypothesized that BOK functions as a tumor suppressor. However, little is known about the molecular functions of BOK. We show that enforced expression of BOK activates the intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic pathway in BAX/BAK-proficient cells but fails to kill cells lacking both BAX and BAK or sensitize them to cytotoxic insults. Interestingly, major portions of endogenous BOK are localized to and partially inserted into the membranes of the Golgi apparatus as well as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and associated membranes. The C-terminal transmembrane domain of BOK thereby constitutes a 'tail-anchor' specific for targeting to the Golgi and ER. Overexpression of full-length BOK causes early fragmentation of ER and Golgi compartments. A role for BOK on the Golgi apparatus and the ER is supported by an abnormal response of Bok-deficient cells to the Golgi/ER stressor brefeldin A. Based on these results, we propose that major functions of BOK are exerted at the Golgi and ER membranes and that BOK induces apoptosis in a manner dependent on BAX and BAK.
17513393	Copper deficiency decreases plasma homocysteine in rats.	The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of copper deficiency on key aspects of homocysteine metabolism that involve methionine recycling and transsulfuration. Male weanling Sprague-Dawley rats were fed AIN-93G-based diets containing <1 or approximately 6 mg Cu/kg. After 6 wk (Expt. 1) and 4 wk (Expt. 2) we found that plasma homocysteine was significantly decreased, and plasma glutathione significantly increased, in rats fed the low-Cu diet. Real-time RT-PCR was used to determine the expression of the subunits of glutamate-cysteine ligase (Gcl) in liver that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in glutathione biosynthesis. The expression of Gclc, the catalytic subunit of Gcl, was upregulated by Cu deficiency; Gclm, the modifier subunit, was not affected. Hepatic betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (Bhmt), which catalyzes one of the two ways that homocysteine can be remethylated to methionine, was downregulated by Cu deficiency. Because Cu deficiency results in upregulation of Gclc and an increase in the biosynthesis of glutathione, it is plausible that the net flux of homocysteine through the transsulfuration pathway is increased. Furthermore, if Bhmt is downregulated, less homocysteine is available for remethylation (methionine recycling) and more is then available to irreversibly enter the transsulfuration pathway where it is lost. The net effect of increased Gclc and decreased Bhmt would be a decrease in homocysteine as a result of Cu deficiency.
23561191	Hepatic biotransformation of alkylresorcinols is mediated via cytochrome P450 and β-oxidation: A proof of concept study.	Alkylresorcinols (AR) are phenolic lipids present in the bran of some cereals. AR may serve as a biomarker for whole grain wheat and rye intake. While AR pharmacokinetics and two major metabolites have been reported, the metabolic pathways contributing to their relatively rapid elimination from the circulation remain to be speculative. In this study, we investigated if ω- and β-oxidation mediate catabolism of the AR homologue C19:0 to form 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid and 3-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)-1-propanoic acid (DHPPA), using 3 in vitro platforms, human cytochrome P450 4F2 (CYP4F2), human liver S9, and HepG2 cells. One hydroxylated C19:0 metabolite was formed by CYP4F2 and one hydroxylated and one carboxylated C19:0 were tentatively identified after incubation of AR with S9. The formation of DHPPA was quantifiable when HepG2 cells were treated with C19:0 for 48h. Our results are consistent with a metabolic pathway by which AR are degraded to phenolic acids via CYP4F2-mediated ω-oxidation and subsequent β-oxidation.
23265465	Effect of the genistein metabolite on leptin secretion in murine adipocytes in vitro.	Soy isoflavonoids have many useful properties. However, they are metabolized in vivo, including in humans. The effect of the metabolism of soy isoflavonoids on their properties is not fully understood. We have isolated the bacterial strain SY8519, which has been shown to metabolize daidzein to O-desmethylangolensin and to produce 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid from genistein. According to chiral HPLC analysis, the 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid obtained from the bacterium was optically active. To determine the absolute stereochemistry of the microbial product, we prepared (S)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid from (S)-2-phenylpropionic and concluded that the microbial product had an R-configuration by chiral HPLC analysis. We also applied the metabolite to mouse adipocytes and found that 2-HPPA was less effective at reducing leptin secretion than the parent compound genistein. Our results suggested that 'O-desmethylangolensin-production' attenuates the effect of soy isoflavonoids by reducing not only the activity of daidzein but also that of genistein.
22898132	Assessment of developmental delay in the zebrafish embryo teratogenicity assay.	In this study we analyzed some aspects of the assessment of developmental delay in the zebrafish embryotoxicity/teratogenicity test and explored the suitability of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity as a biochemical marker and as a higher throughput alternative to morphological endpoints such as head-trunk angle, tail length and morphological score. Embryos were exposed from 4 to 52 h post-fertilization (hpf) to a selection of known embryotoxic/teratogen compounds (valproic acid, retinoic acid, caffeine, sodium salicylate, glucose, hydroxyurea, methoxyacetic acid, boric acid and paraoxon-methyl) over a concentration range. They were evaluated for AChE activity, head-trunk angle, tail length and several qualitative parameters integrated in a morphological score. In general, the different patterns of the concentration-response curves allowed distinguishing between chemicals that produced growth retardation (valproic and methoxyacetic acid) and chemicals that produced non-growth-delay related malformations. An acceptable correlation between the morphological score, AChE activity and head-trunk angle as markers of developmental delay was observed, being AChE activity particularly sensitive to detect delay in the absence of malformations.
23500058	Gene silencing of TNF-alpha in a murine model of acute colitis using a modified cyclodextrin delivery system.	Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic relapsing inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. The cytokine TNF-alpha (TNF-α) plays a pivotal role in mediating this inflammatory response. RNA interference (RNAi) holds great promise for the specific and selective silencing of aberrantly expressed genes, such as TNF-α in IBD. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of an amphiphilic cationic cyclodextrin (CD) vector for effective TNF-α siRNA delivery to macrophage cells and to mice with induced acute-colitis. The stability of CD.siRNA was examined by gel electrophoresis in biorelevant media reflecting colonic fluids. RAW264.7 cells were transfected with CD.TNF-α siRNA, stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and TNF-α and IL-6 responses were measured by PCR and ELISA. Female C57BL/6 mice were exposed to dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) and treated by intrarectal administration with either CD.siRNA TNF-α or a control solution. In vitro, siRNA in CD nanocomplexes remained intact and stable in both fed and fasted simulated colonic fluids. RAW264.7 cells transfected with CD.TNF-α siRNA and stimulated with LPS displayed a significant reduction in both gene and protein levels of TNF-α and IL-6. CD.TNF-α siRNA-treated mice revealed a mild amelioration in clinical signs of colitis, but significant reductions in total colon weight and colonic mRNA expression of TNF-α and IL-6 compared to DSS-control mice were detected. This data indicates the clinical potential of a local CD-based TNF-α siRNA delivery system for the treatment of IBD.
23466342	Reversal of P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance is induced by mollugin in MCF-7/adriamycin cells.	P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an important efflux transporter, is encoded by the MDR1 class of genes and is a central element of the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenomenon in cancer cells. In the present study, we investigated whether mollugin, purified from roots of Rubica cordifolia L., down-regulated MDR1 expression in MCF-7/adriamycin (MCF-7/adr) cells, a human breast multidrug-resistant cancer cell line. Mollugin treatment significantly inhibited MDR1 expression by blocking MDR1 transcription. Mollugin treatment also significantly increased intracellular accumulation of the fluorescently-tagged P-gp substrate, rhodamine-123. The suppression of MDR1 promoter activity and protein expression was mediated through mollugin-induced activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Furthermore, mollugin inhibited MDR1 expression through the suppression of NF-κB and CREB activation. Interestingly, mollugin also inhibited COX-2 expression. These results suggest that mollugin treatment enhanced suppression of P-gp expression by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway and COX-2 expression, as well as attenuating CRE transcriptional activity through AMPK activation.
23040268	Lipoprotein(a) metabolism: potential sites for therapeutic targets.	Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] resembles low-density lipoprotein (LDL), with an LDL lipid core and apolipoprotein B (apoB), but contains a unique apolipoprotein, apo(a). Elevated Lp(a) is an independent risk factor for coronary and peripheral vascular diseases. The size and concentration of plasma Lp(a) are related to the synthetic rate, not the catabolic rate, and are highly variable with small isoforms associated with high concentrations and pathogenic risk. Apo(a) is synthesized in the liver, although assembly of apo(a) and LDL may occur in the hepatocytes or plasma. While the uptake and clearance site of Lp(a) is poorly delineated, the kidney is the site of apo(a) fragment excretion. The structure of apo(a) has high homology to plasminogen, the zymogen for plasmin and the primary clot lysis enzyme. Apo(a) interferes with plasminogen binding to C-terminal lysines of cell surface and extracellular matrix proteins. Lp(a) and apo(a) inhibit fibrinolysis and accumulate in the vascular wall in atherosclerotic lesions. The pathogenic role of Lp(a) is not known. Small isoforms and high concentrations of Lp(a) are found in healthy octogenarians that suggest Lp(a) may also have a physiological role. Studies of Lp(a) function have been limited since it is not found in commonly studied small mammals. An important aspect of Lp(a) metabolism is the modification of circulating Lp(a), which has the potential to alter the functions of Lp(a). There are no therapeutic drugs that selectively target elevated Lp(a), but a number of possible agents are being considered. Recently, new modifiers of apo(a) synthesis have been identified. This review reports the regulation of Lp(a) metabolism and potential sites for therapeutic targets.
17182172	The growth plate sparing effects of the selective glucocorticoid receptor modulator, AL-438.	Long-term use of glucocorticoids (GC) can cause growth retardation in children due to their actions on growth plate chondrocytes. AL-438, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent that acts through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) retains full anti-inflammatory efficacy but has reduced negative effects on osteoblasts compared to those elicited by prednisolone (Pred) or dexamethasone (Dex). We have used the murine chondrogenic ATDC5 cell line to compare the effects of AL-438 with those of Dex and Pred on chondrocyte dynamics. Dex and Pred caused a reduction in cell proliferation and proteoglycan synthesis, whereas exposure to AL-438 had no effect. LPS-induced IL-6 production in ATDC5 cells was reduced by Dex or AL-438, showing that AL-438 has similar anti-inflammatory efficacy to Dex in these cells. Fetal mouse metatarsals grown in the presence of Dex were shorter than control bones whereas AL-438 treated metatarsals paralleled control bone growth. These results indicate that the adverse effects Dex or Pred have on chondrocyte proliferation and bone growth were attenuated following AL-438 exposure, suggesting that AL-438 has a reduced side effect profile on chondrocytes compared to other GCs. This could prove important in the search for new anti-inflammatory treatments for children.
15837316	Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Zonisamide is an effective inhibitor of the cytosolic isozyme II and mitochondrial isozyme V: solution and X-ray crystallographic studies.	The antiepileptic drug zonisamide was considered to act as a weak inhibitor of the zinc enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1) (with a K(I) of 4.3 microM against the cytosolic isozyme II). Here we prove that this is not true. Indeed, testing zonisamide in the classical assay conditions of the CO2 hydrase activity of hCA II, with incubation times of enzyme and inhibitor solution of 15 min, a K(I) of 10.3 microM has been obtained. However, when the incubation between enzyme and inhibitor was prolonged to 1 h, the obtained K(I) was of 35.2 nM, of the same order of magnitude as that of the clinically used sulfonamides/sulfamates acetazolamide, methazolamide, ethoxzolamide and topiramate (K(I)s in the range of 5.4-15.4 nM). The inhibition of the human mitochondrial isozyme hCA V with these compounds has been also tested by means of a dansylamide competition binding assay, which showed zonisamide and topiramate to be effective inhibitors, with K(I)s in the range of 20.6-25.4 nM. The X-ray crystal structure of the adduct of hCA II with zonisamide has also been solved at a resolution of 1.70 A, showing that the sulfonamide moiety participates in the classical interactions with the Zn(II) ion and the residues Thr199 and Glu106, whereas the benzisoxazole ring is oriented toward the hydrophobic half of the active site, establishing a large number of strong van der Waals interactions (<4.5 A) with residues Gln92, Val121, Phe131, Leu198, Thr200, Pro202.
23616352	Selective Bisubstrate Inhibitors with Sub-nanomolar Affinity for Protein Kinase Pim-1.	Potent and selective: The unique nature of the ATP binding pocket structure of Pim family protein kinases (PKs) was used for the development of bisubstrate inhibitors and a fluorescent probe with sub-nanomolar affinity. Conjugates of arginine-rich peptides with two ATP mimetic scaffolds were synthesized and tested as inhibitors of Pim-1. Against a panel of 124 protein kinases, a novel ARC-PIM conjugate selectively inhibited PKs of the Pim family.
23529824	Everolimus in Combination with Exemestane: A Review of its Use in the Treatment of Patients with Postmenopausal Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Advanced Breast Cancer.	Oral everolimus (Afinitor(®)) in combination with exemestane is indicated for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) 2-negative advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women after failure of treatment with letrozole or anastrozole (in the USA) or after recurrence of progression following a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (AI) in women without symptomatic visceral disease (in the EU). Everolimus, a selective inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), inhibits the downstream signalling events of the mTOR pathway. This review summarizes the pharmacology of everolimus and reviews its efficacy and tolerability when administered in combination with exemestane in postmenopausal women with oestrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer refractory to nonsteroidal AIs. In the well-designed BOLERO-2 study, the addition of everolimus to exemestane was shown to significantly prolong progression-free survival in this patient population. However, treatment-emergent adverse events and treatment discontinuations occurred more frequently with combination therapy than with exemestane alone, suggesting a need for careful benefit/risk assessment prior to initiating therapy. Mature survival data from this study are awaited and additional studies would help to further demonstrate the benefit of combination therapy. Nevertheless, current evidence suggests that everolimus plus exemestane combination therapy may be a useful treatment option in patients with postmenopausal hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative, advanced breast cancer refractory to nonsteroidal AIs.
11736858	Neuroimaging of histamine H1-receptor occupancy in human brain by positron emission tomography (PET): a comparative study of ebastine, a second-generation antihistamine, and (+)-chlorpheniramine, a classical antihistamine.	AIMS: Sedation induced by antihistamines is widely recognized to be caused by their penetration through the blood-brain-barrier and the consequent occupation of brain histamine H1-receptors. We previously studied the mechanism of sedation caused by antihistamines using positron emission tomography (PET). Recently, we revealed the nonsedative characteristic of ebastine, a second-generation antihistamine, with cognitive performance tests. In the present study, H1-receptor occupation by ebastine was examined in the human brain using PET. METHODS: Ebastine 10 mg and (+)-chlorpheniramine 2 or 6 mg were orally given to healthy male volunteers. PET scans with [11C]-doxepin, a potent H1-receptor antagonist, were conducted near tmax of respective drugs. Other volunteers in the control group also received PET scans. The binding potential of doxepin (BP = Bmax/Kd) for available brain H1-receptors was imaged on a voxel-by-voxel basis through graphical analysis. By setting regions of interest, the H1-receptor occupancy of drugs was calculated in several H1-receptor rich regions. RESULTS: Brain distribution of radioactivity after ebastine treatment was similar to that without any drugs. However, after the oral administration of 2 mg (+)-chlorpheniramine, the level was lower than after ebastine and nondrug treatments. Graphical analysis followed by statistical parametric mapping (SPM96) revealed that H1-receptor rich regions such as cortices, cingulate gyrus and thalamus were regions where the BPs after ebastine were significantly higher than after (+)-chlorpheniramine (2 mg). H1-receptor occupancies in cortex were approximately 10% by ebastine and > or = 50% by either dose of (+)-chlorpheniramine (95% confidence interval for difference in the mean receptor occupancies: 27%, 54% for 2 mg and 35%, 62% for 6 mg vs ebastine, respectively). Receptor occupancies increased with increasing plasma concentration of (+)-chlorpheniramine, but not with concentration of carebastine, an active metabolite of ebastine. CONCLUSIONS: Ebastine (10 mg orally) causes brain histamine H1-receptor occupation of approximately 10%, consistent with its lower incidence of sedative effect, whereas (+)-chlorpheniramine occupied about 50% of brain H1-receptors even at a low but sedative dose of 2 mg; occupancy of (+)-chlorpheniramine was correlated with plasma (+)-chlorpheniramine concentration.
11972287	Central 5-HT3 receptor stimulation by m-CPBG increases blood glucose in rats.	The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of central 5-HT3 receptors on the control of blood glucose in stressed and non-stressed rats in both fasted and fed states. Adult Wistar male rats had each their third ventricle cannulated 7 days before the experiments. Injections of m-CPBG, a selective 5-HT3 receptor agonist, induced a significant increase in blood glucose in non-stressed rats in both fasted and in fed states. The same procedure was unable to modify stress-induced hyperglycemia. The hyperglycemic effect of m-CPBG central administration was blocked by pretreatment with ondansetron, a specific 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, indicating that the effects here obtained with m-CPBG were a result of its interaction with 5-HT3 receptors. Third ventricle injections of ondansetron alone were not able to modify blood glucose in non-stressed animals and did not change the hyperglycemic responses observed after immobilization stress. We conclude that pharmacological activation of the central 5-HT3 receptor induces a hyperglycemic effect in non-stressed animals.
11060293	The reactive oxygen species--and Michael acceptor-inducible human aldo-keto reductase AKR1C1 reduces the alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal to 1,4-dihydroxy-2-nonene.	The human aldo-keto reductase AKR1C1 (20alpha(3alpha)-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) is induced by electrophilic Michael acceptors and reactive oxygen species (ROS) via a presumptive antioxidant response element (Burczynski, M. E., Lin, H. K., and Penning, T. M. (1999) Cancer Res. 59, 607-614). Physiologically, AKR1C1 regulates progesterone action by converting the hormone into its inactive metabolite 20alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, and toxicologically this enzyme activates polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon trans-dihydrodiols to redox-cycling o-quinones. However, the significance of its potent induction by Michael acceptors and oxidative stress is unknown. 4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) and other alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes produced during lipid peroxidation were reduced by AKR1C1 with high catalytic efficiency. Kinetic studies revealed that AKR1C1 reduced HNE (K(m) = 34 microm, k(cat) = 8.8 min(-1)) with a k(cat)/K(m) similar to that for 20alpha-hydroxysteroids. Six other homogeneous recombinant AKRs were examined for their ability to reduce HNE. Of these, AKR1C1 possessed one of the highest specific activities and was the only isoform induced by oxidative stress and by agents that deplete glutathione (ethacrynic acid). Several hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases of the AKR1C subfamily catalyzed the reduction of HNE with higher activity than aldehyde reductase (AKR1A1). NMR spectroscopy identified the product of the NADPH-dependent reduction of HNE as 1,4-dihydroxy-2-nonene. The K(m) of recombinant AKR1C1 for nicotinamide cofactors (K(m) NADPH approximately 6 microm, K(m)(app) NADH >6 mm) suggested that it is primed for reductive metabolism of HNE. Isoform-specific reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed that exposure of HepG2 cells to HNE resulted in elevated levels of AKR1C1 mRNA. Thus, HNE induces its own metabolism via AKR1C1, and this enzyme may play a hitherto unrecognized role in a response mounted to counter oxidative stress. AKRs represent alternative GSH-independent/NADPH-dependent routes for the reductive elimination of HNE. Of these, AKR1C1 provides an inducible cytosolic barrier to HNE following ROS exposure.
23503460	The regulatory roles of phosphatases in cancer.	The relevance of potentially reversible post-translational modifications required for controlling cellular processes in cancer is one of the most thriving arenas of cellular and molecular biology. Any alteration in the balanced equilibrium between kinases and phosphatases may result in development and progression of various diseases, including different types of cancer, though phosphatases are relatively under-studied. Loss of phosphatases such as PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10), a known tumour suppressor, across tumour types lends credence to the development of phosphatidylinositol 3--kinase inhibitors alongside the use of phosphatase expression as a biomarker, though phase 3 trial data are lacking. In this review, we give an updated report on phosphatase dysregulation linked to organ-specific malignancies.Oncogene advance online publication, 18 March 2013; doi:10.1038/onc.2013.80.
23639248	Bone Morphogenetic Protein-7 inhibits silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats.	Bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7) has been shown to inhibit liver and renal fibrosis in in vivo and in vitro studies. There is no study to investigate BMP-7's role in the development of pulmonary fibrosis induced by silica. In the current study, we used the rat model to explore the potential antifibrotic role of BMP-7 and its underlying mechanism in silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Sixty Wistar rats were randomly assigned into three groups. Control group received saline, silica group received silica and BMP-7 treated group received silica and BMP-7. BMP-7 was administered to silica-treated rats intraperitoneally at a dose of 300μg/kg/injection from day 8 to day 30 every other day. After the animals were sacrificed on day 15 and 30, hydroxyproline levels, the protein expressions of BMP/Smad and TGF-β/Smad signaling, and histopathology in lung tissues were analyzed. The hydroxyproline contents in BMP-7 treated groups were significantly lower than the silica groups (P<0.05). Histopathological results showed BMP-7 could reduce the progression of silica induced fibrosis. Furthermore, the expression of p-Smad1/5/8, a marker of BMP/Smad signaling, was significantly up-regulated in BMP-7 treated groups (P<0.05) compared with the silica groups. On the contrary, the expression of p-Smad2/3, a marker for TGF-β/Smad signaling, reduced significantly in BMP-7-treated groups compared with silica groups (P<0.05). In conclusion, the pulmonary fibrosis induced by silica in rats was significantly reduced with the therapeutic treatment of BMP-7. The antifibrotic effect of BMP-7 could be related to the activation of BMP/Smad signaling and inhibition of TGF-β/Smad pathways.
23614367	Grb10-mediated Negative Regulation of IGF1R-Activated Signalling Pathway Results in Cognitive Disorder in Diabetic Rats.	Growth factor receptor-bound protein 10(Grb10)is a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing protein and one of the binding partners for several trans-membrane tyrosine-kinase receptors, including insulin receptor (IR) and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1-R). The hippocampus, which is critical for cognitive functions, is one of the main distribution areas of Grb10 in the central nervous system. In recent years, diabetic encephalopathy has been defined as a third type of diabetes and the IGF1-IR pathway has been shown to be critical for the neuropathogenic process of cognitive disorder in diabetes. However, the role of endogenous Grb10 in regulating the IGF1-IR pathway and neurobehavioral changes is not explicit. The objective of this study was to determine the in vivo function of endogenous Grb10 in diabetic encephalopathy and the underlying mechanisms. Using stereotaxic surgical techniques and lentiviral vectors expressing specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA), we could steadily knock down Grb10 expression in the hippocampus. More importantly, we demonstrated that hippocampus-specific modulation of Grb10 protein levels led to a prominent remission of cognitive disorder, including improvements in both ultrastructural pathology and abnormal neurobehavioural changes. Our findings indicate that endogenous overexpression of Grb10 functions as a suppressor of the IGF1-IR pathway, which may represent an important mechanism that regulates cognitive disorder in diabetes.

23586436	Using in Situ X-ray Reflectivity to Study Protein Adsorption on Hydrophilic and Hydrophobic Surfaces: Benefits and Limitations.	We have employed in situ X-ray reflectivity (IXRR) to study the adsorption of a variety of proteins (lysozyme, cytochrome c, myoglobin, hemoglobin, serum albumin, and immunoglobulin G) on model hydrophilic (silicon oxide) and hydrophobic surfaces (octadecyltrichlorosilane self-assembled monolayers), evaluating this recently developed technique for its applicability in the area of biomolecular studies. We report herein the highest resolution depiction of adsorbed protein films, greatly improving on the precision of previous neutron reflectivity (NR) results and previous IXRR studies. We were able to perform complete scans in 5 min or less with the maximum momentum transfer of at least 0.52 Å(-1), allowing for some time-resolved information about the evolution of the protein film structure. The three smallest proteins (lysozyme, cytochrome c, and myoglobin) were seen to deposit as fully hydrated, nondenatured molecules onto hydrophilic surfaces, with indications of particular preferential orientations. Time evolution was observed for both lysozyme and myoglobin films. The larger proteins were not observed to deposit on the hydrophilic substrates, perhaps because of contrast limitations. On hydrophobic surfaces, all proteins were seen to denature extensively in a qualitatively similar way but with a rough trend that the larger proteins resulted in lower coverage. We have generated high-resolution electron density profiles of these denatured films, including capturing the growth of a lysozyme film. Because the solution interface of these denatured films is diffuse, IXRR cannot unambiguously determine the film extent and coverage, a drawback compared to NR. X-ray radiation damage was systematically evaluated, including the controlled exposure of protein films to high-intensity X-rays and exposure of the hydrophobic surface to X-rays before adsorption. Our analysis showed that standard measuring procedures used for XRR studies may lead to altered protein films; therefore, we used modified procedures to limit the influence of X-ray damage.
12654248	ANKTM1, a TRP-like channel expressed in nociceptive neurons, is activated by cold temperatures.	Mammals detect temperature with specialized neurons in the peripheral nervous system. Four TRPV-class channels have been implicated in sensing heat, and one TRPM-class channel in sensing cold. The combined range of temperatures that activate these channels covers a majority of the relevant physiological spectrum sensed by most mammals, with a significant gap in the noxious cold range. Here, we describe the characterization of ANKTM1, a cold-activated channel with a lower activation temperature compared to the cold and menthol receptor, TRPM8. ANKTM1 is a distant family member of TRP channels with very little amino acid similarity to TRPM8. It is found in a subset of nociceptive sensory neurons where it is coexpressed with TRPV1/VR1 (the capsaicin/heat receptor) but not TRPM8. Consistent with the expression of ANKTM1, we identify noxious cold-sensitive sensory neurons that also respond to capsaicin but not to menthol.
9537821	Pharmacological profile of antidepressants and related compounds at human monoamine transporters.	Using radioligand binding assays, we determined the equilibrium dissociation constants (KD's) for 37 antidepressants, three of their metabolites (desmethylcitalopram, desmethylsertraline, and norfluoxetine), some mood stabilizers, and assorted other compounds (some antiepileptics, Ca2+ channel antagonists, benzodiazepines, psychostimulants, antihistamines, and monoamines) for the human serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine transporters. Among the compounds that we tested, mazindol was the most potent at the human norepinephrine and dopamine transporters with KD's of 0.45 +/- 0.03 nM and 8.1 +/- 0.4 nM, respectively. Sertraline (KD = 25 +/- 2 nM) and nomifensine (56 +/- 3 nM) were the two most potent antidepressants at the human dopamine transporter. We showed significant correlations for antidepressant affinities at binding to serotonin (R = 0.93), norepinephrine (R = 0.97), and dopamine (R = 0.87) transporters in comparison to their respective values for inhibiting uptake of monoamines into rat brain synaptosomes. These data are useful in predicting some possible adverse effects and drug-drug interactions of antidepressants and related compounds.
16010412	Potential of endogenous estrogen receptor beta to influence the selective ER modulator ERbeta complex.	The ratio of estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) to ERalpha can alter the estrogen-like properties of tamoxifen. Transient transfection of ERbeta cDNA into cells can decrease the estrogen-like properties of the ERalpha:tamoxifen complex, whereas an increase in the amount of ERbeta is associated with tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer. We have addressed each of these hypotheses by examining well characterized laboratory models. We determined whether changes in endogenous ERbeta are responsible for the estrogen-like or antiestrogenic properties of tamoxifen or raloxifene in MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with cDNAs for ERalpha or mutants D351G, D351Y. We found that the amount of ERbeta mRNA in separate, stable transfectants of mutant ERalpha cDNA was always < 2% of ERalpha. Since at least a 50:50 mixture of ERalpha:ERbeta is needed to silence the tamoxifen:ERalpha complex, we conclude that insufficient ERbeta mRNA is available for selective ER modulation in stable transfectants of D351G and D351Y ERalpha. Similarly, to test the hypothesis that ERbeta is up-regulated and plays an important role during the development of tamoxifen-stimulated tumor growth, we quantitatively analyzed ERbeta and ERalpha mRNA in tamoxifen-naive (MCF-7:E2, ECC1:E2) and tamoxifen-stimulated tumors (MCF-7:TAM, EnCa 101:TAM). We found that ERbeta mRNA levels were not significantly elevated in tamoxifen-stimulated tumors and the ERalpha mRNA remained over 99% out of all ER species for all the tumors tested. The same results were also obtained when mRNA levels of ERbeta and ERalpha in a series of tamoxifen-naive and tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer was analyzed. We conclude that endogenous ERbeta may not play a dominant role in the modulation of the tamoxifen ERalpha complex, or in the development of tamoxifen-stimulated resistant tumor growth.
23440956	Graphene-Bonded and -Encapsulated Si Nanoparticles for Lithium Ion Battery Anodes.	Silicon (Si) has been considered a very promising anode material for lithium ion batteries due to its high theoretical capacity. However, high-capacity Si nanoparticles usually suffer from low electronic conductivity, large volume change, and severe aggregation problems during lithiation and delithiation. In this paper, a unique nanostructured anode with Si nanoparticles bonded and wrapped by graphene is synthesized by a one-step aerosol spraying of surface-modified Si nanoparticles and graphene oxide suspension. The functional groups on the surface of Si nanoparticles (50-100 nm) not only react with graphene oxide and bind Si nanoparticles to the graphene oxide shell, but also prevent Si nanoparticles from aggregation, thus contributing to a uniform Si suspension. A homogeneous graphene-encapsulated Si nanoparticle morphology forms during the aerosol spraying process. The open-ended graphene shell with defects allows fast electrochemical lithiation/delithiation, and the void space inside the graphene shell accompanied by its strong mechanical strength can effectively accommodate the volume expansion of Si upon lithiation. The graphene shell provides good electronic conductivity for Si nanoparticles and prevents them from aggregating during charge/discharge cycles. The functionalized Si encapsulated by graphene sample exhibits a capacity of 2250 mAh g(-1) (based on the total mass of graphene and Si) at 0.1C and 1000 mAh g(-1) at 10C, and retains 85% of its initial capacity even after 120 charge/discharge cycles. The exceptional performance of graphene-encapsulated Si anodes combined with the scalable and one-step aerosol synthesis technique makes this material very promising for lithium ion batteries.
14642426	The inhibitory effect of ginseng saponins on the stress-induced plasma interleukin-6 level in mice.	The effect of ginseng saponins on plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) in non-stressed and immobilization-stressed mice were investigated. Ginseng total saponins, ginsenosides Rb2, Rg1 and Rd administered intraperitoneally attenuated the immobilization stress-induced increase in plasma IL-6 level. But, intracerebroventricular injection of each ginsenoside did not affect plasma IL-6 level induced by immobilization stress. Ginsenosides Rb2, Rd and Rg1 significantly decreased norepinephrine and/or epinephrine-induced increase of IL-6 level in macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7). Thus, it can be suggested that the inhibitory action of ginseng saponins against the immobilization stress-induced increase of plasma IL-6 level would be in periphery; at least in part, mediated by blocking norepinephrine- and/or epinephrine-induced increase of IL-6 level in macrophage rather than in the brain. Ginseng saponins might be proposed as a possible candidate in the research or therapeutic modulation of stress-related disorders.
12213053	Mazindol analogues as potential inhibitors of the cocaine binding site at the dopamine transporter.	A series of mazindol (2) and homomazindol (3) analogues with a variety of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups in the pendant aryl group and the benzo ring C, as well as H, methoxy, and alkyl groups replacing the hydroxyl group were synthesized, and their binding affinities at the dopamine transporter (DAT) on rat or guinea pig striatal membranes were determined. Several active analogues were also evaluated for their ability to block uptake of DA, 5-HT, and NE and inhibit binding of [(125)I] RTI-55 at HEK-hDAT, HEK-hSERT, and HEK-hNET cells. Mazindane (26) was found to be a pro-drug, oxidizing (5-H --> 5-OH) to mazindol on rat striatal membranes and HEK-hDAT cells. The 4',7,8-trichloro analogue (38) of mazindol was the most potent and selective ligand for HEK-hDAT cells (DAT K(i) = 1.1 nM; SERT/DAT = 1283 and NET/DAT = 38). Experimental results strongly favor the cyclic or ol tautomers of 2 and 3 to bind more tightly at the DAT than the corresponding keto tautomers.
23621521	Small molecule mediated proliferation of primary retinal pigment epithelial cells.	Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells form a monolayer adjacent to the retina and play a critical role in the visual light cycle. Degeneration of this layer results in vision loss, causing retinal disorders such as age-related macular degeneration. Cell transplant therapies exist to restore vision loss; however, risks associated with and an inadequate supply of donor cells have limited their therapeutic success. The identification of factors that proliferate RPE cells ex vivo could provide a renewable source of cells for the treatment of such disorders. We show that a small molecule (WS3) can reversibly proliferate primary RPE cells isolated from fetal and adult human donors. Following withdrawal of WS3, RPE cells differentiate into a functional monolayer, as exhibited by their expression of mature RPE genes and phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments. Furthermore, chemically expanded RPE cells preserve vision when transplanted into dystrophic Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rats, a well-established model of retinal degeneration.
23344822	Interleukin-10 involvement in exposure to low dose of benzene.	OBJECTIVE: To establish if serum levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10) in subjects exposed to benzene are connected with age, working years, and employment age. METHODS: We evaluated serum levels of IL-10 in 51 employees working in oil refinery (group A) and in 16 office workers who resided in the same area (group B). RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between serum concentrations of IL-10 in groups A and B. There was a statistically significant dependent relationship in group A between age, working years, and serum concentration of IL-10. There was a statistically significant and positive dependent relationship in group A between serum concentration of IL-10 and employment age. CONCLUSIONS: The role played by IL-10 in benzene immune suppression may be relevant and attention should be directed toward assessment of age, working years, and employment age in benzene-exposed populations.
15369444	A review of adjuvant hormonal therapy in breast cancer.	Breast cancer is the most common carcinoma diagnosed in women today excluding non-melanoma skin cancers. It has been well documented that estrogen plays a critical role in its development and is a major target for treatment. For many years, tamoxifen has been the gold standard for adjuvant hormonal therapy in breast cancer patients. With newer products targeting different mechanisms to suppress estrogen production, patients now have many decisions regarding their care. Agents such as luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists can suppress ovarian function in premenopausal patients and have been shown to be as effective and even better than chemotherapy (CMF--cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil-containing regimens) in certain patient populations. Tamoxifen continues to be an option as well as toremifene, a similar selective estrogen receptor modulator. With the advent of newer third generation aromatase inhibitors (anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane) toxicities have been documented to be less and in some cases they are more efficacious than the standard, tamoxifen. This article reviews the current data regarding ovarian suppression, ovarian suppression plus tamoxifen, tamoxifen, toremifene, anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane in the treatment of adjuvant hormonal-sensitive breast cancer.
11578145	Contribution of enzymic alpha, gamma-elimination reaction in detoxification pathway of selenomethionine in mouse liver.	The objective of this study was to clarify the detoxification pathways of selenomethionine (SeMet) in mouse liver. It has been postulated that SeMet may be metabolized to selenocysteine (SeCyH) via a pathway similar to methionine (Met). CySeH may be decomposed to H(2)Se, which is consequently methylated to CH(3)SeH, (CH(3))(2)Se, and (CH(3))(3)Se(+). In this study, we estimated that the median lethal single oral dose (LD(50)) was 67.0 mg/kg. We also found that (CH(3))(3)Se(+) was quickly produced in mouse liver after single oral administration of SeMet. This result suggested the existence of a quick alpha,gamma-elimination pathway. We measured the amounts of alpha-ketobutyrate, NH(3), and CH(3)SeH produced by enzymic alpha,gamma-elimination reaction of SeMet in the liver of periodate-oxidized adenosine (PAD) or D,L-propargylglycine (PPG)-treated mice in order to verify the existence of alpha,gamma-elimination enzyme. PAD is an inhibitor of S-adenosylhomocysteinase (EC 3.3.1.1), which is necessary for conversion of SeMet to SeCyH. PPG is an effective inhibitor of the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-containing enzyme bacterial L-methionine gamma-lyase (EC 4.4.1.11) contributing to the alpha,gamma-elimination reaction of SeMet and cystathionine gamma-lyase (EC 4.4.1.1) relating to conversion of SeMet to SeCyH. When SeMet was incubated with the S9 fraction from liver of PAD-treated mice, the formation of alpha-ketobutyrate was much the same as that from nontreated mouse liver. However, the amount of alpha-ketobutyrate formed significantly decreased in the reaction of SeMet with S9 fraction from the liver of PPG-treated mice. In an in vivo experiment using mice treated with PAD before a toxic dosage of SeMet, the amount of SeMet in the liver decreased and the amount of acid-volatile Se derived from CH(3)SeH increased gradually. This phenomenon was not observed in the PPG-pretreated group. Furthermore, the protein fraction that had the alpha,gamma-elimination enzyme activity was found in mouse liver cytosol by gel chromatographic technique. The results of this study indicated that SeMet was directly metabolized to CH(3)SeH by an alpha,gamma-elimination enzyme analogous to bacterial L-methionine gamma-lyase, in addition to the generally acceptable pathway via SeCyH.
16702880	Comparison of maltose and acarbose as inhibitors of maltase-glucoamylase activity in assaying acid alpha-glucosidase activity in dried blood spots for the diagnosis of infantile Pompe disease.	PURPOSE: The study's purpose was to compare acarbose and maltose as inhibitors of maltase-glucoamylase activity for determining acid alpha-glucosidase activity in dried blood spot specimens for early identification of patients with infantile Pompe disease, a severe form of acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency. METHODS: Acid alpha-glucosidase activities in dried blood spot extracts were determined fluorometrically using the artificial substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-D-pyranoside. Acarbose or maltose was used to inhibit maltase-glucoamylase, an enzyme present in polymorphonuclear neutrophils that contributes to the total alpha-glucosidase activity at acidic pH. RESULTS: Complete discrimination between patients with proven infantile Pompe disease (n = 20), obligate heterozygotes (n = 16), and controls (n = 150) was achieved using 8 micromol/L acarbose as the inhibitor. Higher acarbose concentration (80 micromol/L) did not improve the assay. By using 4 mM maltose as the inhibitor, heterozygotes and patients were not completely separated. The results using acarbose compared well with those using the skin fibroblast assay in the same group of patients with proven infantile Pompe disease. CONCLUSION: Acid alpha-glucosidase activity measurements in dried blood spot extracts can reliably detect infantile Pompe disease in patients. The convenience of collecting and shipping dried blood specimens plus rapid turnaround time makes this assay an attractive alternative to established methods.
15655528	The selectivity of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists at the human beta1, beta2 and beta3 adrenoceptors.	"Beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (""beta-blockers"") are one of the most widely used classes of drugs in cardiovascular medicine (hypertension, ischaemic heart disease and increasingly in heart failure) as well as in the management of anxiety, migraine and glaucoma. Where known, the mode of action in cardiovascular disease is from antagonism of endogenous catecholamine responses in the heart (mainly at beta1-adrenoceptors), while the worrisome side effects of bronchospasm result from airway beta2-adrenoceptor blockade. The aim of this study was to determine the selectivity of beta-antagonists for the human beta-adrenoceptor subtypes. (3)H-CGP 12177 whole cell-binding studies were undertaken in CHO cell lines stably expressing either the human beta1-, beta2- or the beta3-adrenoceptor in order to determine the affinity of ligands for each receptor subtype in the same cell background. In this study, the selectivity of well-known subtype-selective ligands was clearly demonstrated: thus, the selective beta1 antagonist CGP 20712A was 501-fold selective over beta2 and 4169-fold selective over beta3; the beta2-selective antagonist ICI 118551 was 550- and 661-fold selective over beta1 and beta3, respectively, and the selective beta3 compound CL 316243 was 10-fold selective over beta2 and more than 129-fold selective over beta1. Those beta2-adrenoceptor agonists used clinically for the treatment of asthma and COPD were beta2 selective: 29-, 61- and 2818-fold for salbutamol, terbutaline and salmeterol over beta1, respectively. There was little difference in the affinity of these ligands between beta1 and beta3 adrenoceptors. The clinically used beta-antagonists studied ranged from bisoprolol (14-fold beta1-selective) to timolol (26-fold beta2-selective). However, the majority showed little selectivity for the beta1- over the beta2-adrenoceptor, with many actually being more beta2-selective. This study shows that the beta1/beta2 selectivity of most clinically used beta-blockers is poor in intact cells, and that some compounds that are traditionally classed as ""beta1-selective"" actually have higher affinity for the beta2-adrenoceptor. There is therefore considerable potential for developing more selective beta-antagonists for clinical use and thereby reducing the side-effect profile of beta-blockers."
23421930	Bioactive phenolics from Seriphidium stenocephalum.	Chromatographic separation of the ethyl acetate soluble part of the methanolic extract from Seriphidium stenocephalum yielded three new compounds: stenocepflavone (1), stenocepflavan (2), and stenocephol (3), together with cirsimaritin (4), 5,7,5'-trihydroxy-3',4',6-trimethoxyflavone (5), 5,6,7,5'-tetrahydroxy-4'-methoxyflavone (6), and axillaroside (7). All isolates were characterized with the help of spectroscopic data including 1D, 2D NMR, and high resolution mass spectrometry and/or in comparison with the related compounds in literature. All compounds were tested for in vitro enzyme inhibitory activities against acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, and lipoxygenase. Compounds 1 and 4-7 exhibited significant activity against all the tested enzymes, whereas compounds 2 and 3 were found inactive.
18056711	Mutation of Gly721 alters DNA topoisomerase I active site architecture and sensitivity to camptothecin.	DNA topoisomerase I (Top1p) catalyzes the relaxation of supercoiled DNA via a concerted mechanism of DNA strand cleavage and religation. Top1p is the cellular target of the anti-cancer drug camptothecin (CPT), which reversibly stabilizes a covalent enzyme-DNA intermediate. Top1p clamps around duplex DNA, wherein the core and C-terminal domains are connected by extended alpha-helices (linker domain), which position the active site Tyr of the C-terminal domain within the catalytic pocket. The physical connection of the linker with the Top1p clamp as well as linker flexibility affect enzyme sensitivity to CPT. Crystallographic data reveal that a conserved Gly residue (located at the juncture between the linker and C-terminal domains) is at one end of a short alpha-helix, which extends to the active site Tyr covalently linked to the DNA. In the presence of drug, the linker is rigid and this alpha-helix extends to include Gly and the preceding Leu. We report that mutation of this conserved Gly in yeast Top1p alters enzyme sensitivity to CPT. Mutating Gly to Asp, Glu, Asn, Gln, Leu, or Ala enhanced enzyme CPT sensitivity, with the acidic residues inducing the greatest increase in drug sensitivity in vivo and in vitro. By contrast, Val or Phe substituents rendered the enzyme CPT-resistant. Mutation-induced alterations in enzyme architecture preceding the active site Tyr suggest these structural transitions modulate enzyme sensitivity to CPT, while enhancing the rate of DNA cleavage. We postulate that this conserved Gly residue provides a flexible hinge within the Top1p catalytic pocket to facilitate linker dynamics and the structural alterations that accompany drug binding of the covalent enzyme-DNA intermediate.
17334413	H3 histamine receptor agonist inhibits biliary growth of BDL rats by downregulation of the cAMP-dependent PKA/ERK1/2/ELK-1 pathway.	Histamine regulates many functions by binding to four histamine G-coupled receptor proteins (H1R, H2R, H3R and H4R). As H3R exerts their effects by coupling to Galpha(i/o) proteins reducing adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP) levels (a key player in the modulation of cholangiocyte hyperplasia/damage), we evaluated the role of H3R in the regulation of biliary growth. We posed the following questions: (1) Do cholangiocytes express H3R? (2) Does in vivo administration of (R)-(alpha)-(-)-methylhistamine dihydrobromide (RAMH) (H3R agonist), thioperamide maleate (H3R antagonist) or histamine, in the absence/presence of thioperamide maleate, to bile duct ligated (BDL) rats regulate cholangiocyte proliferation? and (3) Does RAMH inhibit cholangiocyte proliferation by downregulation of cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of protein kinase A (PKA)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)/ets-like gene-1 (Elk-1)? The expression of H3R was evaluated in liver sections by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence, and by real-time PCR in cholangiocyte RNA from normal and BDL rats. BDL rats (immediately after BDL) were treated daily with RAMH, thioperamide maleate or histamine in the absence/presence of thioperamide maleate for 1 week. Following in vivo treatment of BDL rats with RAMH for 1 week, and in vitro stimulation of BDL cholangiocytes with RAMH, we evaluated cholangiocyte proliferation, cAMP levels and PKA, ERK1/2 and Elk-1 phosphorylation. Cholangiocytes from normal and BDL rats express H3R. The expression of H3R mRNA increased in BDL compared to normal cholangiocytes. Histamine decreased cholangiocyte growth of BDL rats to a lower extent than that observed in BDL RAMH-treated rats; histamine-induced inhibition of cholangiocyte growth was partly blocked by thioperamide maleate. In BDL rats treated with thioperamide maleate, cholangiocyte hyperplasia was slightly higher than that of BDL rats. In vitro, RAMH inhibited the proliferation of BDL cholangiocytes. RAMH inhibition of cholangiocyte growth was associated with decreased cAMP levels and PKA/ERK1/2/Elk-1 phosphorylation. Downregulation of cAMP-dependent PKA/ERK1/2/Elk-1 phosphorylation (by activation of H3R) is important in the inhibition of cholangiocyte growth in liver diseases.
23550028	2-Hydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone from Hedyotis diffusa Willd induces apoptosis in human leukemic U937 cells through modulation of MAPK pathways.	The herb of Hedyotis diffusa Willd (H. diffusa Willd), an annual herb distributed in northeastern Asia, has been known as a traditional oriental medicine for the treatment of cancer. Recently, Chinese researchers have discovered that two anthraquinones isolated from a water extract of H. diffusa Willd showed apoptosis-inducing effects against cancer cells. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon are poorly understood. The current study determines the role of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) in human leukemic U937 cells apoptosis induced by 2-hydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone from H. diffusa. Our results showed that 2-hydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone decreased phosphorylation-ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2), and increased p-p38MAPK, but did not affect expressions of p-JNK1/2 in U937 cells. Moreover, treatment of U937 cells with 2-hydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone resulted in activation of caspase-3. Furthermore, PD98059 (ERK1/2 inhibitor) significantly enhanced 2-hydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone-induced apoptosis in U937 cells, whereas caspase-3 inhibitor or SB203580 (p-p38MAPK inhibitor), decreased apoptosis in U937 cells. Taken together, our study for the first time suggests that 2-hydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone is able to enhance apoptosis of U937 cells, at least in part, through activation of p-p38MAPK and downregulation of p-ERK1/2. Moreover, the triggering of caspase-3 activation mediated apoptotic induction.
23523950	Avermectin induces P-glycoprotein expression in S2 cells via the calcium/calmodulin/NF-κB pathway.	Avermectin (AVM) is a macrocyclic lactone agent widely used as a nematicide, acaricide and insecticide in veterinary medicine and plant protection. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is an ATP-dependent drug efflux pump for xenobiotic compounds, and is involved in multidrug resistance. To understand the development of AVM resistance in invertebrates, we investigated the mechanisms by which AVM affected P-gp expression in Drosophila S2 cells. We found that AVM induced upregulation of P-gp protein expression, increased P-gp ATPase activity and enhanced cellular efflux of the P-gp substrate rhodamine 123 from cells. Furthermore, we observed that AVM-induced expression of P-gp was due to elevation of intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)]i). This occurred both directly, by activating calcium ion channels, and indirectly, by activating chloride ion channels. These results are supported by our observations that verapamil, a Ca(2+) channel blocker, and niflumic acid, a chloride channel antagonist, significantly attenuated AVM-induced [Ca(2+)]i elevation, thereby reducing P-gp expression. Inhibition of P-gp with anti-P-gp antibody or cyclosporine A (a P-gp inhibitor) reduced the AVM-induced elevation of [Ca(2+)]i, implying that P-gp and [Ca(2+)]i regulate each other. Finally, we found that trifluoperazine, a calmodulin inhibitor, and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamic acid, an NF-κB inhibitor, attenuated the AVM-induced expression of P-gp, suggesting that AVM induces P-gp protein expression via the calmodulin/Relish (NF-κB) signaling pathway.
17340133	Limited availability of L-arginine increases DNA-binding activity of NF-kappaB and contributes to regulation of iNOS expression.	The impact of nutrients on gene expression can be mediated by the availability of amino acids. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of limited availability of L: -arginine on the DNA-binding activity of NF-kappaB, a dominant transcription factor in inflammation, and the consequence for the expression pattern of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in murine keratinocytes. Low availability of L: -arginine leads to activation and increased DNA-binding activity of NF-kappaB and induction of iNOS messenger RNA (mRNA) in the absence of cytokines, but not to translation into iNOS protein. Cytokine challenge at low L: -arginine also enhances iNOS mRNA expression, but translation into iNOS protein is diminished, leading to lowered nitric oxide production. The decrease in iNOS protein expression is mediated by the phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2alpha subunit, a key regulator of cellular translation. In contrast, the mRNA expression of the NF-kappaB-dependent genes IL-1alpha and cationic amino acid transporter-2 (CAT-2) are not affected by the availability of L-arginine. These results demonstrate that the availability of L: -arginine can play a role in the control of gene expression by augmenting the DNA-binding activity of NF-kappaB, which can affect the initiation and progression of dermal inflammation.
23412922	Differential gene expression in ERα-positive and ERα-negative breast cancer cells upon leptin stimulation.	In postmenopausal women, adipositas represents a serious risk factor for cancer development and progression. White adipose tissue secretes the 16 kDa hormone leptin which plays a key role in the regulation of appetite and metabolism. An increasing number of reports indicate that leptin also interferes with signal transduction pathways implicated in the development of breast cancer. In our previous study, we identified the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) as a relevant enhancer of leptin-induced signal transduction leading to transactivation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3). The purpose of this study is the investigation of specific target gene expression in response to leptin-mediated Stat3 signaling. We performed a comprehensive microarray analysis of ERα-positive and ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 cells upon leptin treatment and identified 49 genes which showed a significant ERα-dependent regulation in leptin-treated MDA-MB-231 cells. There was no intersection with genes which were merely up- or downregulated by ERα expression and only 9 and 11 genes overlapping targets which were regulated by leptin stimulation either in ERα-expressing or ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively. To demonstrate the specificity, expression of three target genes was validated by quantitative real-time PCR. In conclusion, these data imply that leptin can induce a different set of target genes dependent on ERα expression, which might contribute to the development and progression of cancer diseases.
17321471	The role of adenosine A(2) receptors in the regulation of TNF-alpha production and PGE(2) release in mouse peritoneal macrophages.	The adenosine A(2) receptors are known to mediate most of the anti-inflammatory activities of adenosine. In lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-stimulated macrophages adenosine strongly inhibits TNF-alpha release, but may also enhance PGE(2) generation. The aims of this study were to determine the relative contributions of the A(2A) and A(2B) receptor subclasses in these two effects and to determine whether the enhanced release of PGE(2) contributes to the inhibition of TNF-alpha release. In LPS-stimulated mouse macrophages, adenosine potently inhibited TNF-alpha production and also potentiated PGE(2) release, though less potently (IC(50)=250 nM vs EC(50) approximately 8 microM, respectively). The non-selective adenosine receptor agonist NECA, and the selective A(2A) receptor agonist CGS21680 also inhibited TNF-alpha production even more potently (IC(50)=4.8 and 2.3 nM, respectively). NECA, but not CGS21680, also enhanced PGE(2) production. The selective A(2A) receptor antagonist ZM241385 (30 nM), but not the selective A(2B) receptor antagonist MRS1754 (30 nM), blocked the inhibitory effect of NECA and CGS21680 on TNF-alpha release. On the other hand, MRS1754, but not ZM241385, abolished the PGE(2) potentiating effect of NECA. Pre-treatment with indomethacin (1 microM) abolished adenosine-induced PGE(2) release enhancement but did not prevent the inhibition of TNF-alpha release. These results show that in this system, the inhibition of TNF-alpha release by adenosine is mediated by the A(2A) receptors whereas the enhancement of PGE(2) release appears to be mediated by the A(2B) receptors. The results also show that while exogenous PGE(2) is a potent inhibitor of TNF-alpha release, the enhanced PGE(2) release induced by adenosine does not appear to contribute to the inhibition of TNF-alpha release.
23212742	Enhancement of hepatic 4-hydroxylation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 through CYP3A4 induction in vitro and in vivo: Implications for drug-induced osteomalacia.	Long-term therapy with certain drugs, especially cytochrome P450 (P450; CYP)-inducing agents, confers an increased risk of osteomalacia that is attributed to vitamin D deficiency. Human CYP24A1, CYP3A4, and CYP27B1 catalyze the inactivation and activation of vitamin D and have been implicated in the adverse drug response. In this study, the inducibility of these enzymes and monohydroxylation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25OHD3 ) were evaluated after exposure to P450-inducing drugs. With human hepatocytes, treatment with phenobarbital, hyperforin, carbamazepine, and rifampin significantly increased the levels of CYP3A4, but not CYP24A1 or CYP27B1 mRNA. In addition, rifampin pretreatment resulted in an 8-fold increase in formation of the major metabolite of 25OHD3 , 4β,25(OH)2 D3 . This inductive effect was blocked by the addition of 6',7'-dihydroxybergamottin, a selective CYP3A4 inhibitor. With human renal proximal tubular HK-2 cells, treatment with the same inducers did not alter CYP3A4, CYP24A1, or CYP27B1 expression. 24R,25(OH)2 D3 was the predominant monohydroxy metabolite produced from 25OHD3 , but its formation was unaffected by the inducers. With healthy volunteers, the mean plasma concentration of 4β,25(OH)2 D3 was increased 60% (p < 0.01) after short-term rifampin administration. This was accompanied by a statistically significant reduction in plasma 1α,25(OH)2 D3 (-10%; p = 0.03), and a nonsignificant change in 24R,25(OH)2 D3 (-8%; p = 0.09) levels. Further analysis revealed a negative correlation between the increase in 4β,25(OH)2 D3 and decrease in 1α,25(OH)2 D3 levels. Examination of the plasma monohydroxy metabolite/25OHD3 ratios indicated selective induction of the CYP3A4-dependent 4β-hydroxylation pathway of 25OHD3 elimination. These results suggest that induction of hepatic CYP3A4 may be important in the etiology of drug-induced osteomalacia. © 2013 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.
23086198	Importance of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases 2A2 and 2A3 in tobacco carcinogen metabolism.	UDP-glucuronosyltransferase A1 (UGT2A1) is expressed in the lung and exhibits activity against polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), suggesting UGT2A1 involvement in the local metabolism of PAH tobacco carcinogens. The goal of the present study was to investigate the importance of two additional UGT2A enzymes, UGT2A2 and UGT2A3, in tobacco carcinogen metabolism. Real-time polymerase chain reaction suggested that wild-type UGT2A2 had the highest expression in the breast, followed by trachea > larynx > kidney. A novel splice variant of UGT2A2 lacking exon 3 (termed UGT2A2Δexon3) was investigated, with UGT2A2Δexon3 expression determined to be 25-50% that of wild-type UGT2A2 in all tissues examined. UGT2A3 was determined to be well expressed in the liver and colon, followed by pancreas > kidney > lung > tonsil > trachea > larynx. Cell homogenates prepared from human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells overexpressing wild-type UGT2A2 (termed UGT2A2_i1) exhibited glucuronidation activity, as observed by reverse-phase ultra-pressure liquid chromatography, against 1-hydroxy-(OH)-pyrene, 1-naphthol, and hydroxylated benzo(a)pyrene metabolites, whereas homogenates prepared from HEK293 cells overexpressing UGT2A3 only showed activity against simple PAHs like 1-OH-pyrene and 1-naphthol. Activity assays showed the UGT2A2Δexon3 protein (termed UGT2A2_i2) exhibited no detectable glucuronidation activity against all substrates examined; however, coexpression studies suggested that UGT2A2_i2 negatively modulates UGT2A2_i1 activity. Both UGT2A2 and UGT2A3 exhibited no detectable activity against complex PAH proximate carcinogens, tobacco-specific nitrosamines, or heterocyclic amines. These data suggest that, although UGT2A1 is the only UGT2A enzyme active against PAH proximate carcinogens (including PAH diols), both UGTs 2A1 and 2A2 play an important role in the local detoxification of procarcinogenic monohydroxylated PAH metabolites.
23261528	Inhibition of Th1/Th17 responses via suppression of STAT1 and STAT3 activation contributes to the amelioration of murine experimental colitis by a natural flavonoid glucoside icariin.	Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder in the intestine which involves overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and excessive functions of inflammatory cells. However, current treatments for IBD may have potential adverse effects including steroid dependence, infections and lymphoma. Therefore new therapies or drug candidates for the treatment of IBD are desperately needed. In the present study we found that icariin, a major bioactive compound from plants in Epimedium family, exerted protective effect on intestinal inflammation in mice induced by dextran sulfate sodium. Oral administration of icariin significantly attenuated the disease progression and alleviated the pathological changes of colitis. It also inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and expression of p-p65, p-STAT1 and p-STAT3 in colon tissues. Further study showed that icariin dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation and activation of T lymphocytes, and suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine levels of activated T cells. Moreover, icariin treatment inhibited the phosphorylations of STAT1 and STAT3 in CD4(+) T cells, which were the crucial transcription factors for Th1 and Th17 respectively. Taken together, these results indicate that icariin is a potential therapeutic agent for IBD.
3146348	Effectors of the activation of human [Glu1]plasminogen by human tissue plasminogen activator.	The activation of human [Glu1]plasminogen [( Glu1]Pg) by human recombinant (rec) two-chain tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) is inhibited by Cl-, at physiological concentrations, and stimulated by epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA), as well as fibrin(ogen). Chloride functions as a result of its binding to [Glu1]Pg, with a Ki of approximately 9.0 mM, thereby rendering [Glu1]Pg a less effective substrate for two-chain rec-t-PA. EACA stimulates the activation in Cl-(-)containing solutions, with a Ka of approximately 4.0 mM, primarily by reversal of the Cl-(-)inhibitory effect. Fibrinogen appears to exert its stimulatory properties mainly through effects on the enzyme, two-chain rec-t-PA, with a Ka of approximately 3.7 microM in activation systems containing physiological levels of Cl-. Analysis of the results of this paper reveals that normal plasma components, Cl- and fibrinogen, exert major regulatory roles on the ability of [Glu1]Pg to be activated by two-chain rec-t-PA, in in vitro systems. The presence of Cl- inhibits the stimulation of [Glu1]Pg activation that would normally occur in the presence of fibrinogen, a result of possible importance to the observation that some degree of systemic fibrinogenolysis accompanies therapeutic use of tissue plasminogen activator.
20089905	A molecular mechanism for ibuprofen-mediated RhoA inhibition in neurons.	Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug widely used to relieve pain and inflammation in many disorders via inhibition of cyclooxygenases. Recently, we have demonstrated that ibuprofen inhibits intracellular signaling of RhoA and promotes significant axonal growth and functional recovery following spinal cord lesions in rodents. In addition, another study suggests that ibuprofen reduces generation of amyloid-beta42 peptide via inactivation of RhoA signaling, although it may also regulate amyloid-beta42 formation by direct inhibition of the gamma-secretase complex. The molecular mechanisms by which ibuprofen inhibits the RhoA signal in neurons, however, remain unclear. Here, we report that the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) is essential for coupling ibuprofen to RhoA inhibition and subsequent neurite growth promotion in neurons. Ibuprofen activates PPARgamma in neuron-like PC12 and B104 cells. Activation of PPARgamma with traditional agonists mimics the RhoA-inhibiting properties of ibuprofen in PC12 cells and, like ibuprofen, promotes neurite elongation in primary cultured neurons exposed to axonal growth inhibitors. Protein knockdown with small interfering RNA specific for PPARgamma blocks RhoA suppression of PPARgamma agonists in PC12 cells. Moreover, the effect of ibuprofen on RhoA activity and neurite growth in neuronal cultures is prevented by selective PPARgamma inhibition. These findings support that PPARgamma plays an essential role in mediating the RhoA-inhibiting effect of ibuprofen. Elucidation of the novel molecular mechanisms linking ibuprofen to RhoA inhibition may provide additional therapeutic targets to the disorders characterized by RhoA activation, including spinal cord injuries and Alzheimer's disease.
11430635	Indomethacin activates carbonic anhydrase and antagonizes the effect of the specific carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide, by a direct mechanism of action.	OBJECTIVES: In this paper we investigated the effect of indomethacin, acetazolamide and their combination in vitro and in vivo on carbonic anhydrase (CA) isozymes. METHOD: In vitro experiments followed the effect of the two substances at concentrations between 10(-8)-10(-4) M on purified human red cell CA I and II as well as on human gastric mucosa CA IV using dose-response relationships. Kinetic studies were also performed. The effects of single and combined administration of indomethacin and acetazolamide on red cell CA and on gastric acid secretion were studied in vivo. RESULTS: Indomethacin, in vitro and in vivo. induces an increase in erythorcyte CA I and CA II activity. Acetazolamide, a specific inhibitor of CA, reduces the activity of CA I and CA II from red cells. Indomethacin completely antagonizes CA activity, i.e. abolishes the inhibitory effect of acetazolamide on CA. In humans, an increase or decrease in erythrocyte CA II activity is correlated with an increase or decrease in gastric acid secretion. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that indomethacin, a known cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, is also an activator of CA. Our data also prove that indomethacin is not only an activator of CA but also antagonizes the effect of acetazolamide, a specific inhibitor of this enzyme. In view of the role of CA in acid-base balance as well as the fact that an increase or decrease in its activity is accompanied by an increase or decrease in intra- and extracellular pH, our results suggest that: firstly, CA activation induced by indomethacin might cause changes in COX activity; secondly, PGs are synthetized as a consequence of the changes in COX activity, a hypothesis that requires further study.
17409426	Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs induce colorectal cancer cell apoptosis by suppressing 14-3-3epsilon.	To determine the role of 14-3-3 in colorectal cancer apoptosis induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), we evaluated the effects of sulindac on 14-3-3epsilon protein expression in colorectal cancer cells. Sulindac sulfide inhibited 14-3-3epsilon proteins in HT-29 and DLD-1 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Sulindac sulfone at 600 mumol/L inhibited 14-3-3epsilon protein expression in HT-29. Indomethacin and SC-236, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, exerted a similar effect as sulindac. Sulindac suppressed 14-3-3epsilon promoter activity. As 14-3-3epsilon promoter activation is mediated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARdelta), we determined the correlation between 14-3-3epsilon inhibition and PPARdelta suppression by NSAIDs. Sulindac sulfide inhibited PPARdelta protein expression and PPARdelta transcriptional activity. Overexpression of PPARdelta by adenoviral transfer rescued 14-3-3epsilon proteins from elimination by sulindac or indomethacin. NSAID-induced 14-3-3epsilon suppression was associated with reduced cytosolic Bad with elevation of mitochondrial Bad and increase in apoptosis which was rescued by Ad-PPARdelta transduction. Stable expression of 14-3-3epsilon in HT-29 significantly protected cells from apoptosis. Our findings shed light on a novel mechanism by which NSAIDs induce colorectal cancer apoptosis via the PPARdelta/14-3-3epsilon transcriptional pathway. These results suggest that 14-3-3epsilon is a target for the prevention and therapy of colorectal cancer.
3058238	Tamoxifen and fluoxymesterone versus tamoxifen and danazol in metastatic breast cancer--a randomized study.	A prospective randomized trial of tamoxifen and fluoxymesterone versus tamoxifen and danazol in metastatic breast cancer was conducted from December 1980 to September 1985. Patients were eligible regardless of site of disease, estrogen receptor status, or age. Sixty-two of sixty-three randomized patients were evaluable for response. Overall response for tamoxifen and fluoxymesterone was 11% with 61% stabilization of disease, versus 12% response rate for tamoxifen and danazol with 59% stabilization. Toxicities with tamoxifen and fluoxymesterone were greater with an increase in masculinization. We conclude that the response rates to the combinations of tamoxifen and fluoxymesterone or tamoxifen and danazol reported are equivalent in this study but that the increased toxicity with tamoxifen and fluoxymesterone would make tamoxifen and danazol the treatment of choice if a combination were to be used.
10935465	The apoptosome: heart and soul of the cell death machine.	"Apoptosis is a fundamental biologic process by which metazoan cells orchestrate their own self-demise. Genetic analyses of the nematode C elegans identified three core components of the suicide apparatus which include CED-3, CED-4, and CED-9. An analogous set of core constituents exists in mammalian cells and includes caspase-9, Apaf-1, and bcl-2/xL, respectively. CED-3 and CED-4, along with their mammalian counterparts, function to kill cells, whereas CED-9 and its mammalian equivalents protect cells from death. These central components biochemically intermingle in a ternary complex recently dubbed the ""apoptosome."" The C elegans protein EGL-1 and its mammalian counterparts, pro-apoptotic members of the bcl-2 family, induce cell death by disrupting apoptosome interactions. Thus, EGL-1 may represent a primordial signal integrator for the apoptosome. Various biochemical processes including oligomerization, adenosine triphosphate ATP/dATP binding, and cytochrome c interaction play a role in regulating the ternary death complex. Recent studies suggest that cell death receptors, such as CD95, may amplify their suicide signal by activating the apoptosome. These mutual associations by core components of the suicide apparatus provide a molecular framework in which diverse death signals likely interface. Understanding the apoptosome and its cellular connections will facilitate the design of novel therapeutic strategies for cancer and other disease states in which apoptosis plays a pivotal role."
23623751	Adolescence methylphenidate treatment in a rodent model of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder: Dopamine transporter function and cellular distribution in adulthood.	Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is attributed to dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex. Methylphenidate, an inhibitor of dopamine and norepinephrine transporters (DAT and NET, respectively), is a standard treatment for ADHD. The Spontaneously Hypertensive Rat (SHR) is a well-established animal model of ADHD. Our previous results showed that methylphenidate treatment in adolescent SHR enhanced cocaine self-administration during adulthood, and alterations in DAT function in prefrontal cortex play a role in this response. Importantly, prefrontal cortex subregions, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), have been shown to have distinct roles in ADHD and cocaine self-administration. In the current study, SHR, Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and Wistar (WIS) rats received a therapeutically relevant dose of methylphenidate (1.5mg/kg, p.o.) or vehicle during adolescence and then OFC and mPFC DAT function and cellular expression were assessed during adulthood. In both OFC and mPFC, no strain differences in Vmax or Km for dopamine uptake into synaptosomes were found between vehicle-treated SHR, WKY and WIS. Methylphenidate increased DAT Vmax in SHR mPFC and decreased DAT Vmax in WKY OFC. Also, methylphenidate decreased DAT Km in WIS OFC. Further, methylphenidate did not alter DAT cellular localization, indicating that methylphenidate treatment during adolescence regulated DAT function in SHR mPFC in a trafficking-independent manner. Thus, the increase in mPFC DAT function was an SHR-specific long term consequence of methylphenidate treatment during adolescence, which may be responsible for the treatment-induced alterations in behavior including the observed increases in cocaine self-administration.
23434227	Synthesis and cytotoxicity evaluation of oleanolic acid derivatives.	Twelve derivatives of oleanolic acid (1) have been synthesized and evaluated for their inhibitory activities against the growth of prostate PC3, breast MCF-7, lung A549, and gastric BGC-823 cancer cells by MTT assays. Within these series of derivatives, compound 17 exhibited the most potent cytotoxicity against PC3 cell line (IC50=0.39 μM) and compound 28 displayed the best activity against A549 cell line (IC50=0.22 μM). SAR analysis indicates that H-donor substitution at C-3 position of oleanolic acid may be advantageous for improvement of cytotoxicity against PC3, A549 and MCF-7 cell lines.
16249524	Serotonin 5-ht2c receptor agonists: potential for the treatment of obesity.	Obesity continues to be a burgeoning health problem worldwide. Before their removal from the market, fenfluramine and the more active enantiomer dexfenfluramine were considered to be among the most effective of weight loss agents. Much of the weight loss produced by fenfluramine was attributed to the direct activation of serotonin 5-HT(2C) receptors in the central nervous system via the desmethyl-metabolite of fenfluramine, norfenfluramine. Norfenfluramine, however, is non-selective, activating additional serotonin receptors, such as 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2B), which likely mediated the heart valve hypertrophy seen in many patients. Development of highly selective 5-HT(2C) agonists may recapitulate the clinical anti-obesity properties observed with fenfluramine while avoiding the significant cardiovascular and pulmonary side effects.
10670413	The prostaglandin E series modulates high-voltage-activated calcium channels probably through the EP3 receptor in rat paratracheal ganglia.	The modulation of high-voltage-activated (HVA) Ca2+ channels by the prostaglandin E series (PGE1 and PGE2) was studied in the paratracheal ganglion cells. Prostaglandin E1, E2, STA2 (a stable analogue of thromboxane A2), 17-phenyl-trinor-PGE2 (an EP1-selective agonist) and sulprostone (an EP3-selective agonist) inhibited the HVA Ca2+ current (HVA ICa) dose-dependently, and the rank order of potency to inhibit HVA Ca2+ channels was sulprostone>PGE2, PGE1>STA2>>17-phenyl-trinor-PGE2. SC-51089 (10(-5) M), a selective EP1-receptor antagonist, showed no effect on the PGE1- or PGE2-induced inhibition of the HVA ICa, thereby indicating that PGE1- and PGE2-induced inhibition of the HVA Ca2+ channels is possibly mediated by the EP3 receptor. The PGE1-sensitive component of the current was markedly reduced in the presence of omega-conotoxin-GVIA (3x10(-6) M), but not with nifedipine (3x10(-6) M). PGE1 and PGE2 also inhibited the remaining ICa in a saturating concentration of nifedipine, omega-conotoxin-GVIA and omega-conotoxin-MVIIC, suggesting that R-type Ca2+ channels are involved. The inhibitory effect of PGE1 or sulprostone was prevented by pretreatment with pertussis toxin [islet activating protein (IAP)] or phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), and the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor chelerythrine blocked the action of PMA. It was concluded that PGE1 selectively reduces both N- and R-type Ca2+ currents by activating a G-protein probably through the EP3 receptor in paratracheal ganglion cells.
9406449	Species differences between chickens and rats in chemical properties of adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase.	Chemical characterization of chicken and rat lipoprotein lipase (LPL) was carried out following purification of LPL. Molecular weight and isoelectric point of both purified enzymes were determined to be 60 KDa and pH 4, while optimum temperature and pH to yield the maximal activity were about 37 degrees C and pH 8.5. Metallic ions, NaCl and protamine sulfate reduced, and heparin increased, both LPL activities. Michaelis constants for LPLs determined with triolein emulsion as the substrate were 0.98 and 1.57, and those of Vmax were 379.2 and 181.3, in chickens and rats, respectively. Triton WR-1339 caused mixed-type inhibition in rat, but inhibited chicken LPL noncompetitively. In LPLs of chickens and rats, values of Ki were 66.7 and 36.4 with triolein emulsion as the substrate, and 832.4 and 66.0 with respective VLDL as the substrate. These results show species difference between chickens and rats in the affinity to lipoproteins of LPL and inhibition of LPL by Triton WR-1339.
9311592	Strong decrease in biotin content may correlate with metabolic alterations in colorectal adenocarcinoma.	Short-chain fatty acids are an important source of energy for colonocytes. One of these is propionate, which is metabolized through carboxylation by propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC), an enzyme encoded by 2 genes, PCCA and PCCB. The co-factor of this reaction is biotin, a product of intestinal bacterial metabolism, as is propionate. Despite detailed knowledge about the metabolic effects and physiology of biotin, the relative amounts of this vitamin in normal colonic mucosae and in tumour tissue remains quite unknown. The biotin content in normal and cancerous cells from the distal digestive tract was examined on 10 pairs of tissue specimens of colorectal cancer and adjacent normal mucosae using reflectance in situ hybridization (RISH). Having observed a high biotin content in colon mucosae and a low content in colorectal-cancer cells, we then studied the transcription levels of PCCA and PCCB genes in 9 colorectal cancers and the corresponding mucosae. In all cases, the levels of mRNA were lower in colorectal cancers than in normal mucosae, the decrease being always more marked for PCCB than for PCCA. In normal mucosae and in adenocarcinoma cancer cells, PCCA and PCCB transcription levels were strongly related to the amount of biotin detected, but not to the number of chromosomes 13 (which carries PCCA) or 3 (which carries PCCB).
11447307	Hemodynamic effects of bosentan in patients with chronic heart failure.	A role of the potent and long-acting vasoconstrictor peptide endothelin-1 and the pathophysiology of chronic human heart failure has been postulated based upon indirect evidence such as elevated plasma endothelin-1 levels and their with the degree of hemodynamic impairment. The advent of specific of endothelin-1 receptor antagonists has provided the opportunity not only to directly evaluate its pathophysiological role but also to assess its potential role as a new approach to heart failure therapy. This brief review summarizes the evidence linking endothelin-1 to the pathophysiology of chronic heart failure and the clinical results obtained in patients during acute, intravenous and more prolonged, oral administration with bosentan, a mixed ET(A)/ET(B)-receptor antagonist. Bosentan acutely and during short-term oral therapy markedly improved hemodynamics in patients in addition to standard heart failure therapy, including an ACE-inhibitor. These effects were associated with a reduced responsiveness of the renin-angiotensin system to diuretic therapy and reduced basal plasma aldosterone levels. Although the hemodynamic and neurohumoral profile of short-term bosentan therapy looks promising for the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure appropriate trials will have to be performed to document clinical benefit during long-term therapy. Finally, the question remains open whether mixed endothelin-1 receptor antagonists like bosentan will have similar effects as compared to antagonists which block the ET(A) receptor only.
23586470	Quantitative Determination of Lateral Concentration and Depth Profile of Histidine-Tagged Recombinant Proteins Probed by Grazing Incidence X-ray Fluorescence.	We have demonstrated that the complementary combination of grazing incidence X-ray fluorescence (GIXF) with specular X-ray reflectivity (XRR) can be used to quantitatively determine the density profiles of Ni(2)(+) ions complexed with chelator headgroups as well as S atoms in recombinant proteins anchored to lipid monolayers at the air/water interface. First, we prepared phospholipid monolayers incorporating chelator lipid anchors at different molar fractions at the air/water interface. The fine-structures perpendicular to the global plane of monolayers were characterized by XRR in the presence of Ni(2)(+) ions, yielding the thickness, roughness, and electron density of the stratified lipid monolayers. X-ray fluorescence intensities from Ni Kα core levels recorded at the incidence angles below and above the critical angle of total reflection allow for the determination of the position and lateral density of Ni(2)(+) ions associated with chelator headgroups with a high spatial accuracy (±5 Å). The coupling of histidine-tagged Xenopus cadherin 11 (Xcad-11) can also be identified by changes in the fines-structures using XRR. Although fluorescence intensities from S Kα level were much weaker than Ni Kα signals, we could detect the location of S atoms in recombinant Xcad-11 proteins.
23425274	Gel electrophoretic methods for the analysis of biosimilar pharmaceuticals using the example of recombinant erythropoietin.	Due to their versatility and cost-effectiveness, gel electrophoretic methods provide an important set of tools for the analysis of therapeutic proteins. As an increasing number of biosimilar pharmaceuticals are entering the market, techniques are required that allow reliable demonstration of comparability of these products with the reference products. Isoelectric focusing, SDS-PAGE, native PAGE and 2D electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) have been frequently applied for this purpose. Supplementary techniques are fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis and sarcosyl-PAGE. Of additional importance is the comparison of recombinant with endogenously synthesized glycoproteins. Reagent array analysis combined with SDS-PAGE and western blotting proved especially useful for this purpose. As an example for the application of these methods, the analysis of recombinant originator erythropoietins and some of their biosimilar counterparts is described.
22966070	Tub has a key role in insulin and leptin signaling and action in vivo in hypothalamic nuclei.	Mutation of tub gene in mice induces obesity, suggesting that tub could be an important regulator of energy balance. In the current study, we investigated whether insulin, leptin, and obesity can modulate Tub in vivo in hypothalamic nuclei, and we investigated possible consequences on energy balance, neuropeptide expression, and hepatic glucose metabolism. Food intake, metabolic characteristics, signaling proteins, and neuropeptide expression were measured in response to fasting and refeeding, intracerebroventricular insulin and leptin, and Tub antisense oligonucleotide (ASO). Tub tyrosine phosphorylation (Tub-p-tyr) is modulated by nutritional status. Tub is a substrate of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase (IRTK) and leptin receptor (LEPR)-Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) in hypothalamic nuclei. After leptin or insulin stimulation, Tub translocates to the nucleus. Inhibition of Tub expression in hypothalamus by ASO increased food intake, fasting blood glucose, and hepatic glucose output, decreased O(2) consumption, and blunted the effect of insulin or leptin on proopiomelanocortin, thyroid-releasing hormone, melanin-concentrating hormone, and orexin expression. In hypothalamus of mice administered a high-fat diet, there is a reduction in leptin and insulin-induced Tub-p-tyr and nuclear translocation, which is reversed by reducing protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B expression. These results indicate that Tub has a key role in the control of insulin and leptin effects on food intake, and the modulation of Tub may contribute to insulin and leptin resistance in DIO mice.
23201927	Cardioprotective effect of salvianolic acid B against arsenic trioxide-induced injury in cardiac H9c2 cells via the PI3K/Akt signal pathway.	The clinical use of arsenic trioxide (ATO), a potent anti-neoplastic agent, is often limited because of its severe cardiotoxicity. Salviae miltiorrhiza is widely used for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. One of the most abundant ingredients of S. miltiorrhiza is salvianolic acid B (Sal B). The present study was designed to evaluate whether Sal B protects against ATO-induced cardiac cell injury in vitro. With MTT cell viability assay, LDH release, ROS generation, caspase-3 activity assay and Hoechst 33342/PI staining, we found that Sal B pretreatment provided significantly protection against ATO-induced cell death. The effect was correlated with the activation of the PI3K/Akt signal pathway. Conversely, blocking Akt activation with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 effectively suppressed the protective effect of Sal B against ATO-induced cell apoptosis. In addition, the PI3K inhibitor partially blocked the effects of Sal B on the upregulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl protein expression, and downregulation of Bax protein expression. Collectively, the results showed that Sal B decreased the apoptosis and necrosis of H9c2 cardiomyocytes caused by ATO treatment, and PI3K played a crucial role in enhancing cell survival during this process. These observations indicate that Sal B has the potential to exert cardioprotective effects against ATO toxicity.
15942707	Carvedilol prevents cardiac hypertrophy and overexpression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor in pressure-overloaded rat heart.	The use of beta-blockers has emerged as a beneficial treatment for cardiac hypertrophy. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) is tightly regulated in the ventricular myocardium. However, the expression of HIF-1alpha in cardiac hypertrophy due to pressure overload and after treatment with beta-blocker is little known. To evaluate the effect of carvedilol on both myocardial HIF-1alpha expression and cardiac hypertrophy, infra-renal aortic banding was performed for 4 weeks in adult Sprague-Dawley rats to induce cardiac hypertrophy. Carvedilol at 50 mg/kg body weight per day after surgery was given. Heart weight and the ratio of heart weight and body weight increased significantly after aortic banding for 4 weeks in the absence of drug treatment. Mean arterial pressure increased from 80 +/- 9 mmHg in the sham group to 94 +/-5 mmHg (p < 0.001) in the banding group. Echocardiography showed concentric hypertrophy after aortic banding. Mean arterial pressure decreased after treatment with carvedilol. The increased wall thickness and heart weight was reversed to normal by carvedilol. Western blot showed that HIF-1alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) proteins were up-regulated and nerve growth factor-beta (NGF-beta) down-regulated in the banding group. Treatment with valsartan, doxazosin, or N-acetylcysteine did not significantly affect HIF-1alpha and VEGF proteins expression in the banding groups. Real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that mRNA of HIF-1alpha, VEGF and BNP increased and mRNA of NGF-beta decreased in the banding group. Treatment with carvedilol reversed both protein and mRNA of HIF-1alpha, VEGF, BNP, and NGF-beta to the baseline values. Increased immunohistochemical labeling of HIF-1alpha, VEGF, and BNP in the ventricular myocardium was observed in the banding group and carvedilol again normalized the labeling. In conclusion, HIF-1alpha, VEGF, and BNP mRNA and protein expression were up-regulated, while NGF-beta mRNA and protein was downregulated in the rat model of pressure-overloaded cardiac hypertrophy. Treatment with carvedilol is associated with a reversal of abnormal regulation of HIF-1alpha, VEGF, BNP, and NGF-beta in the hypertrophic myocardium.
22064666	Endothelial nitric oxide synthase genotypes and haplotypes modify the responses to sildenafil in patients with erectile dysfunction.	Erectile dysfunction (ED) is usually treated with sildenafil. Although genetic polymorphisms in the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene may impair endogenous NO formation, there is little information about how eNOS polymorphisms and haplotypes affect the responses to sildenafil. We studied 118 patients; 63 patients had ED secondary to radical prostatectomy (PED) and 55 had organic, clinical ED. eNOS genotypes for three eNOS polymorphisms (T(-786)C, rs2070744; a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) in intron 4; and Glu298Asp, rs1799983) were determined, and eNOS haplotypes were estimated using PHASE 2.1. The clinical responses to sildenafil were evaluated and the patients were classified as good responders (GR) or poor responders (PR) when their changes in five-item version of International Index for Erectile Function questionnaire were above or below the median value. The TC/CC genotypes and the C allele for the T(-786)C polymorphism were more common in GR, compared with PR patients with PED. However, the 4b4a/4a4a genotypes and the 4a allele for the VNTR polymorphism in intron 4 were more common in GR, compared with PR patients with clinical ED. The C-4a-Glu haplotype was more common in GR than in PR patients with PED. Conversely, the T-4b-Asp haplotype was less common in GR than in PR patients with PED. No other significant differences were found. Our findings show evidence that eNOS polymorphisms affect the responses of PED and clinical ED patients to sildenafil.
7511163	5 beta-Methyl-14 beta-(p-nitrocinnamoylamino)-7,8-dihydromorphinone and its corresponding N-cyclopropylmethyl analog, N-cyclopropylmethylnor-5 beta-methyl-14 beta-(p-nitrocinnamoylamino)- 7,8-dihydromorphinone: mu-selective irreversible opioid antagonists.	5 beta-Methyl-14 beta-(p-nitrocinnamoylamino)-7,8-dihydromorphinone (MET-CAMO) and its corresponding N-cyclopropylmethyl analog, N-cyclopropylmethylnor-5 beta-methyl-14 beta-(p-nitrocinnamoylamino)- 7,8-dihydromorphinone (N-CPM-MET-CAMO) were tested in opioid receptor binding assays and in the mouse tail-flick test in order to characterize the affinity, selectivity and antinociceptive properties of these two compounds. Incubating bovine striatal membranes with either MET-CAMO or N-CPM-MET-CAMO produced a wash-resistant, concentration- and time-dependent inhibition of the binding of the mu-selective ligand, [3H]-[D-Ala2,MePhe4,Gly(ol)5]enkephalin, but with no change in delta or kappa binding. Preincubating membranes with N-CPM-MET-CAMO decreased the maximum binding value for [3H]-[D-Ala2,MePhe4,Gly(ol)5]enkephalin binding without changing the Kd value. In the mouse tail-flick assay, MET-CAMO and N-CPM-MET-CAMO did not produce any antinociception up to a dose of 100 nmol after i.c.v. administration. However, pretreatment of mice with either compound produced a time- and dose-dependent antagonism of morphine-induced antinociception. Analgesia mediated by delta or kappa opioids was not altered by either MET-CAMO or N-CPM-MET-CAMO at a dose of up to 100 nmol. The mu antagonistic effect of 1 nmol of MET-CAMO and N-CPM-MET-CAMO appeared at 8 hr and lasted up to 72 hr, with a maximal effect at 16 to 24 hr after i.c.v. administration. Pretreatment of mice with 1 nmol of MET-CAMO or N-CPM-MET-CAMO, given by i.c.v. administration at -24 hr, produced a rightward and downward shift of dose-response line of i.c.v. morphine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
23171045	New 2-(aryloxy)-3-phenylpropanoic acids as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α/γ dual agonists able to upregulate mitochondrial carnitine shuttle system gene expression.	The preparation of a series of 2-(aryloxy)-3-phenylpropanoic acids, resulting from the introduction of different substituents into the biphenyl system of the previously reported peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α/γ (PPARα/γ) dual agonist 1, allowed the identification of new ligands with higher potency on PPARα and fine-tuned moderate PPARγ activity. For the most promising stereoisomer (S)-16, X-ray and calorimetric studies in PPARγ revealed, at high ligand concentration, the presence of two molecules simultaneously bound to the receptor. On the basis of these results and docking experiments in both receptor subtypes, a molecular explanation was provided for its different behavior as a full and partial agonist of PPARα and PPARγ, respectively. The effects of (S)-16 on mitochondrial acylcarnitine carrier and carnitine-palmitoyl-transferase 1 gene expression, two key components of the carnitine shuttle system, were also investigated, allowing the hypothesis of a more beneficial pharmacological profile of this compound compared to the less potent PPARα agonist fibrates currently used in therapy.
12671891	Methionine adenosyltransferase II beta subunit gene expression provides a proliferative advantage in human hepatoma.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Of the 2 genes (MAT1A, MAT2A) encoding methionine adenosyltransferase, the enzyme that synthesizes S-adenosylmethionine, MAT1A, is expressed in liver, whereas MAT2A is expressed in extrahepatic tissues. In liver, MAT2A expression associates with growth, dedifferentiation, and cancer. Here, we identified the beta subunit as a regulator of proliferation in human hepatoma cell lines. The beta subunit has been cloned and shown to lower the K(m) of methionine adenosyltransferase II alpha2 (the MAT2A product) for methionine and to render the enzyme more susceptible to S-adenosylmethionine inhibition. METHODS: Methionine adenosyltransferase II alpha2 and beta subunit expression was analyzed in human and rat liver and hepatoma cell lines and their interaction studied in HuH7 cells. beta Subunit expression was up- and down-regulated in human hepatoma cell lines and the effect on DNA synthesis determined. RESULTS: We found that beta subunit is expressed in rat extrahepatic tissues but not in normal liver. In human liver, beta subunit expression associates with cirrhosis and hepatoma. beta Subunit is expressed in most (HepG2, PLC, and Hep3B) but not all (HuH7) hepatoma cell lines. Transfection of beta subunit reduced S-adenosylmethionine content and stimulated DNA synthesis in HuH7 cells, whereas down-regulation of beta subunit expression diminished DNA synthesis in HepG2. The interaction between methionine adenosyltransferase II alpha2 and beta subunit was demonstrated in HuH7 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that beta subunit associates with cirrhosis and cancer providing a proliferative advantage in hepatoma cells through its interaction with methionine adenosyltransferase II alpha2 and down-regulation of S-adenosylmethionine levels.
23292249	"The physico-chemical ""anatomy"" of the tautomerization through the DPT of the biologically important pairs of hypoxanthine with DNA bases: QM and QTAIM perspectives."	"The biologically important tautomerization of the Hyp·Cyt, Hyp*·Thy and Hyp·Hyp base pairs to the Hyp*·Cyt*, Hyp·Thy* and Hyp*·Hyp* base pairs, respectively, by the double proton transfer (DPT) was comprehensively studied in vacuo and in the continuum with a low dielectric constant (ε = 4) corresponding to hydrophobic interfaces of protein-nucleic acid interactions by combining theoretical investigations at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level of QM theory with QTAIM topological analysis. Based on the sweeps of the energetic, electron-topological, geometric and polar parameters, which describe the course of the tautomerization along the intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC), it was proved that the tautomerization through the DPT is concerted and asynchronous process for the Hyp·Cyt and Hyp*·Thy base pairs, while concerted and synchronous for the Hyp·Hyp homodimer. The continuum with ε = 4 does not affect qualitatively the course of the tautomerization reaction for all studied complexes. The nine key points along the IRC of the Hyp·Cyt↔Hyp*·Cyt* and Hyp*·Thy↔Hyp·Thy* tautomerizations and the six key points of the Hyp·Hyp↔Hyp*·Hyp* tautomerization have been identified and fully characterized. These key points could be considered as electron-topological ""fingerprints"" of concerted asynchronous (for Hyp·Cyt and Hyp*·Thy) or synchronous (for Hyp·Hyp) tautomerization process via the DPT. It was found, that in the Hyp*·Cyt*, Hyp·Thy*, Hyp·Hyp and Hyp*·Hyp* base pairs all H-bonds are significantly cooperative and mutually reinforce each other, while the C2H…O2 H-bond in the Hyp·Cyt base pair and the O6H…O4 H-bond in the Hyp*·Thy base pair behave anti-cooperatively, i.e., they become weakened, while two others become strengthened."
9231746	Mechanisms of inhibition of calmodulin-stimulated cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase by dihydropyridine calcium antagonists.	Calmodulin-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (CaMPDE) is one of the key enzymes involved in the complex interaction between the cyclic nucleotide and Ca2+ second-messenger systems. CaMPDE exists as tissue-specific isozymes, and initially these isozymes were designated according to their respective subunit molecular mass. A variety of pharmacological agents have been used to inhibit CaMPDE, and this inhibition occurs mostly via Ca2+-dependent association with the proteins. We have examined the effect of dihydropyridine Ca2+-channel blockers felodipine and nicardipine on CaMPDE. The results suggest that the 63-kDa (PDE 1B1) and 60-kDa (PDE 1A2) CaMPDE isozymes are inhibited by felodipine and nicardipine by partial competitive inhibition and that these two Ca2+ antagonists appear to counteract each other. This study further demonstrates the existence of a specific site, distinct from the active site on CaMPDE, that exhibits high-affinity binding of these drugs. Felodipine and nicardipine have similar affinities for 60-kDa CaMPDE isozymes but bring about different levels of enzyme inhibition, suggesting the possibility of designing specific drugs that can protect the enzyme from inhibition by dihydropyridine Ca2+-channel blockers.
23032515	8-Hydroxycalamenene isolated from the rhizomes of Reynoutria elliptica exerts neuroprotective effects both in vitro and in vivo.	Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) death caused by oxidative stress is a common risk factor for glaucoma. In the present study, 8-hydroxycalamenene was isolated from the hexane fraction of Reynoutria elliptica. We showed that 8-hydroxycalamenene attenuated the cell death of transformed RGC-5 cells. This compound also produced a dose-dependent decrease in the expression of apoptotic proteins (cleaved PARP and caspase-3) induced by l-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO) plus glutamate and stimulated glutathione and glutathione S-transferase activity. Moreover, the addition of 8-hydroxycalamenene to cell cultures restored the reduced mitochondrial membrane potential resulting from glutamate/BSO treatment. The presence of N-methyl-d-aspartate in the retina of rats affected the thickness of the inner plexiform layer (IPL) and increased the number of TUNEL-positive RGCs. However, 8-hydroxycalamenene protected against thinning of the IPL and reduced TUNEL-positive cells in the ganglion cell layer. Thus, 8-hydroxycalamenene isolated from R. elliptica exerts neuroprotective effects both in vitro and in vivo.
10070614	The human NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase NDUFS5 (15 kDa) subunit: cDNA cloning, chromosomal localization, tissue distribution and the absence of mutations in isolated complex I-deficient patients.	We have cloned the cDNA of the NDUFS5 subunit (15 kDa) of the human mitochondrial respiratory chain complex NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I). The open reading frame consists of 321 base-pairs, coding for 106 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 12.5 kDa. There is an 81.0% identity with the bovine equivalent on cDNA level and 74.5% identity on amino acid basis. PCR analysis of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids revealed that the human NDUFS5 gene maps to chromosome 1. The NDUFS5 mRNA is expressed ubiquitously in human tissues, with a relative higher expression in human heart, skeletal muscle, liver, kidney and fetal heart. A mutation detection study of twenty isolated enzymatic complex I-deficient patients revealed no mutations, nor polymorphisms.
10765977	Effect of L-arginine-nitric oxide system on the metabolism of essential fatty acids in chemical-induced diabetes mellitus.	Several studies have shown that the activities of delta-6-desaturase and delta-5-desaturase are depressed in experimental diabetes and in humans with insulin- and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (type I and type II diabetes mellitus respectively). Furthermore, treatment with insulin is known to correct the defects in desaturases in rats and humans with diabetes, especially in type I. In a recent study, we demonstrated that L-arginine and nitric oxide can prevent alloxan-induced beta cell damage, and the severity of diabetes, and restore the antioxidant status to near normal levels. But, no information is available as to the relationship between L-arginine-nitric oxide system and the metabolism of essential fatty acids in diabetes mellitus. In the present study, it was noted that the plasma levels of saturated fatty acids: stearic and palmitic were increased where as unsaturated fatty acids such as oleic, linoleic, gamma-linolenic and eicosapentaenoic acids (OA, LA, GLA and EPA respectively) were decreased in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. In the liver phospholipid (PL) fraction, GLA, DGLA (dihomo-GLA) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) were decreased in the alloxan-treated group; in the muscle PL fraction, LA, GLA and DGLA were low, whereas an increase in the saturated fatty acid content was noted. L-arginine (the precursor of nitric oxide) and sodium nitroprusside (a nitric oxide donor) treatment of alloxan-induced diabetic rats enhanced the levels of LA, GLA and DGLA. Further, nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, L-NMMA, prevented this beneficial action of L-arginine-nitric oxide system on essential fatty acid metabolism. The abnormalities in the essential fatty acid metabolism observed also reverted to normalcy following control of diabetes with insulin. These results indicate that nitric oxide can enhance the activities of delta-6- and delta-5 desaturases, which are depressed in diabetes, and suggests that there is a close interaction between L-arginine-nitric oxide system and the metabolism of essential fatty acids.
23153456	IFNα converts IL-22 into a cytokine efficiently activating STAT1 and its downstream targets.	Besides their antiviral activity, type I Interferons (IFN) display context-specific immunomodulation. In contrast to long-known IFNα/β, Interleukin (IL)-22 is an anti-bacterial, largely tissue protective cytokine that recently gained attention. Herein, cellular IFNα/IL-22 interactions are investigated. We report that pre-conditioning of epithelial cells with IFNα initiated dramatic changes in IL-22 signaling normally dominated by signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3. Specifically, by using human DLD1 colon epithelial/carcinoma cells we demonstrate that, upon IFNα, IL-22 converts into a cytokine robustly activating STAT1 and its downstream pro-inflammatory targets CXCL9, CXCL10, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Accordingly, only after IFNα pre-incubation was IL-22-induced STAT1 binding to the CXCL10 promoter detectable. Using the viral mimic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid and the IFNα/β antagonist B18R we furthermore demonstrate the capability of endogenous IFN to promote IL-22-induced STAT1 activation and expression of CXCL10. IL-22-induced STAT1 activation subsequent to IFNα priming became likewise apparent in human Caco2 colon epithelial/carcinoma cells, HepG2 hepatoma cells, and primary keratinocytes. Current observations may relate to characteristics of IFNα/β in clinical therapy and expose margins of tissue protection by IL-22 application.
8319997	Comparative effects of three different potent renin inhibitors in primates.	The goal of the present study was to compare the effects of three potent reference renin inhibitors (remikiren, CGP 38560A, and enalkiren) in sodium-depleted normotensive squirrel monkeys. In these monkeys, arterial pressure was measured in the conscious state with a telemetry system. Oral and intravenous maximal effective doses of the three renin inhibitors were compared in parallel groups of monkeys. In additional experiments, remikiren was given on top of either CGP 38560A or enalkiren in the same animals. Finally, the three drugs were compared with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril. The effects of the three drugs on the plasma components of the renin-angiotensin system (plasma renin activity, immunoreactive renin, and immunoreactive angiotensin II concentrations) were also measured. Our results show that remikiren was as effective as cilazapril and markedly more effective than CGP 38560A or enalkiren in reducing arterial pressure in our monkey model. Interestingly, these differences in arterial pressure could not be explained by differences of in vitro potency or different biochemical changes of the plasma components of the renin-angiotensin system, because the inhibitors all reduced immunoreactive angiotensin II to similarly low levels. One possible explanation is that, in our model, remikiren in contrast to CGP 38560A and enalkiren is able to inhibit renin in a functionally important extraplasmatic compartment.
23317165	Recent Developments of p38α MAP Kinase Inhibitors as Antiinflammatory Agents Based on the Imidazole Scaffolds.	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other chronic inflammatory diseases are always the major therapeutic challenges. Recent research efforts provided new insights into the molecular basis of these diseases and new opportunities for developing improved anti-inflammatory drugs. The p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase plays a central role in the regulation of the biosynthesis and release of several proinflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β). Hence, inhibition of the p38 MAP kinase is regarded as a promising therapeutic strategy for controlling inflammatory diseases. A diverse range of p38α MAP kinase inhibitors have been developed as potential anti-inflammatory agents, and some of them have entered the phase II clinical trials. The imidazole derivatives are known as competitive inhibitors at the ATP binding site of the p38α MAP kinase. Modifications on the imidazole scaffold have led to a large amount of potent p38α MAP kinase inhibitors. This review will summarize the developments of small molecule p38α MAP kinase inhibitors based on the imidazole core scaffolds in recent 10 years. Variations at the N1, C2, C4 and C5 positions of imidazole were introduced, and the structure-activity relationships of these imidazole inhibitors were also discussed.
23487486	Effects of progesterone and medroxyprogesterone on actin remodeling and neuronal spine formation.	Sex steroids are important regulators of neuronal cell morphology, and this is critical for gender differences in brain function and dysfunction. Neuronal morphology is controlled by multiprotein complexes including moesin (a member of the ezrin/radixin/moesin family), focal adhesion kinase (FAK), or the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein-family verprolin homologous (WAVE1) protein, controlling dynamic remodeling of the cytoskeleton and cell membrane. We investigated the actions of natural progesterone (P) and of the synthetic progestin medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) on actin remodeling, focal adhesion complex formation, and actin branching in rat cortical neurons. Treatment with P and, to a lesser extent, MPA, increases the number and density of dendritic spines. P increases the phosphorylation of moesin, FAK, and WAVE1, and their redistribution toward cell membrane sites where spines are formed. Signaling to moesin is achieved by PR via a Gα/Gβ-dependent signaling to the small GTPase Ras homolog gene family, member A and its related kinase, Rho-associated kinase-2. In parallel, WAVE1 recruitment is triggered by a Gαi/Gβ-dependent signaling of PR to c-Src, FAK, and Rac1 GTPase. Rac1 recruits cyclin-dependent kinase-5, which phosphorylates WAVE1. Silencing of moesin, FAK, or WAVE1 abrogates the increase in dendritic spines induced by progesterone. In all applications, MPA is found to act similar to P, albeit with a lower efficacy. In conclusion, our findings indicate that the control of actin polymerization and branching and focal adhesion complex formation via moesin, FAK, and WAVE1 is a key function of progesterone receptor in neurons, which may be relevant for the regulation of dendritic spine turnover and neuronal plasticity.
23360295	Effects of polymer end-group chemistry and order of deposition on controlled protein delivery from layer-by-layer assembly.	"Layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly is an attractive platform for controlled release of biologics given its mild fabrication process and versatility in coating substrates of any shape. Proteins can be incorporated into LBL coatings by sequentially depositing oppositely charged polyelectrolytes, which self-assemble into nanoscale films on medical devices or tissue engineering scaffolds. However, previously reported LBL platforms often require the use of a few hundred layers to avoid burst release, which hinders their broad translation due to the lengthy fabrication process, cost, and batch-to-batch variability. Here we report a biodegradable LBL platform composed of only 10 layers with tunable protein release kinetics, which is an order of magnitude less than previously reported LBL platforms. We performed a combinatorial study to examine the effects of polymer chemistry and order of deposition of poly(β-amino) esters on protein release kinetics under 81 LBL assembly conditions. Using the optimal ""polyelectrolyte couples"" for constructing the LBL film, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was released gradually over 14 days with retained biological activity to stimulate cell proliferation. The method reported herein is applicable for coating various substrates including metals, polymers, and ceramics and may be used for a broad range of biomedical and tissue engineering applications."
17653133	Determination of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase activity in the kidney.	Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) metabolizes asymmetric dimethylarginine to generate L-citrulline and is present in large quantities in the kidney. We present a new study that optimizes the Prescott-Jones colorimetric assay to measure DDAH-dependent L-citrulline generation in kidney homogenates. We found that the removal of urea with urease is necessary since urea also produces a positive reaction. Deproteinization with sulfosalicylic acid was found to be optimal and that protease inhibitors were not necessary. All assays were conducted in phosphate buffer, since other common additives can create false positive and false negative reactions. Arginase or nitric oxide synthase isoenzymes were not found to influence L-citrulline production. Our optimized L-citrulline production assay to measure DDAH activity correlated closely with the direct measure of the rate of asymmetric dimethylarginine consumption. Using this assay, we found that both superoxide and nitric oxide inhibit renal cortical DDAH activity in vitro.
23259865	Synthesis and biological evaluation of indenoisoquinolines that inhibit both tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase I (Tdp1) and topoisomerase I (Top1).	Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase I (Tdp1) plays a key role in the repair of damaged DNA resulting from the topoisomerase I (Top1) inhibitor camptothecin and a variety of other DNA-damaging anticancer agents. This report documents the design, synthesis, and evaluation of new indenoisoquinolines that are dual inhibitors of both Tdp1 and Top1. Enzyme inhibitory data and cytotoxicity data from human cancer cell cultures were used to establish structure-activity relationships. The potencies of the indenoisoquinolines against Tdp1 ranged from 5 μM to 111 μM, which places the more active compounds among the most potent known inhibitors of this target. The cytotoxicity mean graph midpoints ranged from 0.02 to 2.34 μM. Dual Tdp1-Top1 inhibitors are of interest because the Top1 and Tdp1 inhibitory activities could theoretically work synergistically to create more effective anticancer agents.
23613080	Hierarchical NiO microflake films with high coloration efficiency, cyclic stability and low power consumption for applications in a complementary electrochromic device.	We have demonstrated that thin films of hierarchical NiO microflakes assembled from nanoleaves can be grown directly on FTO-coated glass substrates using a facile and template-free hydrothermal technique. This hierarchical structure holds the advantages of both nanometre-sized building blocks and microsized assemblies. Thus, the films exhibit highly enhanced electrochromic performances and cyclic stability due to their high surface area and good electrochemical stability. Moreover, a complementary electrochromic device combining the hierarchical NiO microflake film with a self-weaving WO3 nanoflake film is fabricated to further improve the electrochromic performance. As a result, the complementary electrochromic device shows a high optical modulation (73.2% at 550 nm), large coloration efficiency (146.9 cm(2) C(-1) at 550 nm by applying a low coloration voltage of -1.0 V) and fast switching responses with a coloring time of 1.8 s and a bleaching time of 3.2 s. It is also observed that there is no significant degradation of the electrochromic properties after 2000 continuous coloration/bleaching cycles, making it attractive for practical applications.
15286093	Central effects of fexofenadine and cetirizine: measurement of psychomotor performance, subjective sleepiness, and brain histamine H1-receptor occupancy using 11C-doxepin positron emission tomography.	Histamine H1-receptor (H1R) antagonists, or antihistamines, often induce sedative side effects when used for the treatment of allergic disorders. This study compared the sedative profiles of the second-generation antihistamines, fexofenadine and cetirizine, using 3 different criteria: subjective sleepiness evaluated by the Stanford Sleepiness Scale, objective psychomotor tests (simple and choice reaction time tests and visual discrimination tests at 4 different exposure durations), and measurement of histamine H1-receptor occupancy (H1RO) in the brain. Subjective sleepiness and psychomotor performance were measured in 20 healthy Japanese volunteers at baseline and 90 min after administration of fexofenadine 120 mg or cetirizine 20 mg in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. Hydroxyzine 30 mg was included as a positive control. H1RO was measured using positron emission tomography (PET) with (11)C-doxepin in 12 of the 20 subjects, and a further 11 volunteers were recruited to act as controls. In psychomotor tests, fexofenadine was not significantly different from placebo and significantly less impairing than cetirizine on some tasks, as well as significantly less impairing than hydroxyzine on all tasks. For subjective sleepiness, fexofenadine was not significantly different from placebo, whereas cetirizine showed a trend toward increased sleepiness compared with fexofenadine and placebo. H1RO was negligible with fexofenadine (-0.1%) but moderately high with cetirizine (26.0%). In conclusion, fexofenadine 120 mg is distinguishable from cetirizine 20 mg, as assessed by H1RO and psychomotor testing.
15489888	Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents differ in their ability to suppress NF-kappaB activation, inhibition of expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and cyclin D1, and abrogation of tumor cell proliferation.	Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin have been shown to suppress transcription factor NF-kappaB, which controls the expression of genes such as cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and cyclin D1, leading to inhibition of proliferation of tumor cells. There is no systematic study as to how these drugs differ in their ability to suppress NF-kappaB activation and NF-kappaB-regulated gene expression or cell proliferation. In the present study, we investigated the effect of almost a dozen different commonly used NSAIDs on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced NF-kappaB activation and NF-kappaB-regulated gene products, and on cell proliferation. Dexamethasone, an anti-inflammatory steroid, was included for comparison with NSAIDs. As indicated by DNA binding, none of the drugs alone activated NF-kappaB. All compounds inhibited TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation, but with highly variable efficacy. The 50% inhibitory concentration required was 5.67, 3.49, 3.03, 1.25, 0.94, 0.60, 0.38, 0.084, 0.043, 0.027, 0.024, and 0.010 mM for aspirin, ibuprofen, sulindac, phenylbutazone, naproxen, indomethacin, diclofenac, resveratrol, curcumin, dexamethasone, celecoxib, and tamoxifen, respectively. All drugs inhibited IkappaBalpha kinase and suppressed IkappaBalpha degradation and NF-kappaB-regulated reporter gene expression. They also suppressed NF-kappaB-regulated COX-2 and cyclin D1 protein expression in a dose-dependent manner. All compounds inhibited the proliferation of tumor cells, with 50% inhibitory concentrations of 6.09, 1.12, 0.65, 0.49, 1.01, 0.19, 0.36, 0.012, 0.016, 0.047, 0.013, and 0.008 mM for aspirin, ibuprofen, sulindac, phenylbutazone, naproxen, indomethacin, diclofenac, resveratrol, curcumin, dexamethasone, celecoxib, and tamoxifen, respectively. Overall these results indicate that aspirin and ibuprofen are least potent, while resveratrol, curcumin, celecoxib, and tamoxifen are the most potent anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative agents of those we studied.
23635319	Piezotronic Effect in Solution-Grown p-Type ZnO Nanowires and Films.	Investigating the piezotronic effect in p-type piezoelectric semiconductor is critical for developing a complete piezotronic theory and designing/fabricating novel piezotronic applications with more complex functionality. Using a low temperature solution method, we were able to produce ultralong (up to 60 μm in length) Sb doped p-type ZnO nanowires on both rigid and flexible substrates. For the p-type nanowire field effect transistor, the on/off ratio, threshold voltage, mobility, and carrier concentration of 0.2% Sb-doped sample are found to be 10(5), 2.1 V, 0.82 cm(2)·V(-1)·s(-1), and 2.6 × 10(17) cm(-3), respectively, and the corresponding values for 1% Sb doped samples are 10(4), 2.0 V, 1.24 cm(2)·V(-1)·s(-1), and 3.8 × 10(17) cm(-3). We further investigated the universality of piezotronic effect in the as-synthesized Sb-doped p-type ZnO NWs and reported for the first time strain-gated piezotronic transistors as well as piezopotential-driven mechanical energy harvesting based on solution-grown p-type ZnO NWs. The results presented here broaden the scope of piezotronics and extend the framework for its potential applications in electronics, optoelectronics, smart MEMS/NEMS, and human-machine interfacing.
23081912	Fungicide prochloraz and environmental pollutant dioxin induce the ABCG2 transporter in bovine mammary epithelial cells by the arylhydrocarbon receptor signaling pathway.	"The molecular mechanisms by which environmental pollutants including 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) or widely used imidazole fungicide prochloraz display their toxic effects in vertebrates are still not well understood. Using computer analysis, we recently identified nuclear aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) binding sites termed ""dioxin response elements"" (DREs) in the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of efflux transporter ABCG2 (Accession No. EU570105) from the bovine mammary gland. As these regulatory motifs mediate regulation of target genes by AhR agonists including TCDD and prochloraz, we have systematically investigated the effect of both contaminants on functional ABCG2 transport activity in primary bovine mammary epithelial cells. TCDD or prochloraz doubled ABCG2-mediated Hoechst H33342 secretion. This effect was almost completely reversed by specific ABCG2 inhibitor Ko143. In further mechanistic studies, we showed that this induction was due to binding of activated AhR to DRE sequences in the ABCG2 5'-UTR. Receptor binding was significantly reduced by specific AhR antagonist salicyl amide. Induction of AhR by TCDD and prochloraz resulted in a time- and dose-dependent increase of ABCG2 gene expression and transporter protein levels. As ABCG2 represents the main mammary transporter for xenobiotics including drugs and toxins, exposure to prevalent AhR agonists may enhance transporter-mediated secretion of potential harmful compounds into milk. Through identification of mammary ABCG2 as a novel target gene of pesticide prochloraz and dioxin, our results may therefore help to improve the protection of breast-feeding infants and the consumer of dairy products."
23509039	2-aminothiazoles with improved pharmacotherapeutic properties for treatment of prion disease.	Recently, we described the aminothiazole lead (4-biphenyl-4-ylthiazol-2-yl)-(6-methylpyridin-2-yl)-amine (1), which exhibits many desirable properties, including excellent stability in liver microsomes, oral bioavailability of ∼40 %, and high exposure in the brains of mice. Despite its good pharmacokinetic properties, compound 1 exhibited only modest potency in mouse neuroblastoma cells overexpressing the disease-causing prion protein PrP(Sc) . Accordingly, we sought to identify analogues of 1 with improved antiprion potency in ScN2a-cl3 cells while retaining similar or superior properties. Herein we report the discovery of improved lead compounds such as (6-methylpyridin-2-yl)-[4-(4-pyridin-3-yl-phenyl)thiazol-2-yl]amine and cyclopropanecarboxylic acid (4-biphenylthiazol-2-yl)amide, which exhibit brain exposure/EC50 ratios at least tenfold greater than that of compound 1.
12588370	Selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition does not affect the healing of cutaneous full-thickness incisional wounds in SKH-1 mice.	BACKGROUND: The inducible cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme is upregulated in inflammatory diseases, as well as in epithelial cancers, and has an established role in angiogenesis and tissue repair. OBJECTIVE: Because of these physiological effects and the widespread use of the selective COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, we wanted to determine if inhibition of COX-2 would affect incisional skin wound healing. METHODS: Using a cutaneous full-thickness, sutured, incisional wound model in hairless SKH-1 mice, we evaluated the role of COX-2 in the wound healing process by comparing the effects of a nonselective COX inhibitor, diclofenac, with a selective COX-2 inhibitor, SC-791. Healing was monitored for up to 28 days postincision histologically and for recovery of wound strength. RESULTS: COX-2 expression was observed over the first week of healing, peaking at day 3 and was not affected by treatment with the selective COX-2 or nonselective COX inhibitors. Infiltrating macrophages, as well as keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts at the wound site, expressed COX-2. Neither selective COX-2, nor nonselective COX inhibition had a significant effect on the macroscopic or microscopic morphology of the wounds, whereas dexamethasone treatment resulted in epidermal and granulation tissue atrophy. In addition, neither selective COX-2, nor nonselective COX inhibition altered keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, dermal angiogenesis or the recovery of wound tensile strength, whereas dexamethasone reduced the tensile strength of the wounds by 30-38% throughout the healing period. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that selective COX-2 inhibition does not affect the healing of surgical skin wounds.
22983867	Swim training of monosodium L-glutamate-obese mice improves the impaired insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in pancreatic islets.	The goal of the present study was to investigate changes on glucose homoeostasis and of the insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) signalling in pancreatic islets from MSG-obese mice submitted to or not submitted to swim training. Swim training of 90-day-old MSG mice was used to evaluate whether signalling pathways of the IR and IRS-1 in islets are involved with the insulin resistance and glucose intolerance observed in this obese animal model. The results showed that IR tyrosine phosphorylation (pIR) was reduced by 42 % in MSG-obese mice (MSG, 6.7 ± 0.2 arbitrary units (a.u.); control, 11.5 ± 0.4 a.u.); on the other hand, exercise training increased pIR by 76 % in MSG mice without affecting control mice (MSG, 11.8 ± 0.3; control, 12.8 ± 0.2 a.u.). Although the treatment with MSG increased IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation (pIRS-1) by 96 % (MSG, 17.02 ± 0.6; control, 8.7 ± 0.2 a.u.), exercise training also increased it in both groups (control, 13.6 ± 0.1; MSG, 22.2 ± 1.1 a.u.). Current research shows that the practice of swim training increases the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 which can modulate the effect caused by obesity in insulin receptors.
1647395	Evidence that estramustine binds MAP-1A to inhibit type IV collagenase secretion.	Estramustine is a novel anti-microtubule drug shown to bind MAP-1 and MAP-2 (microtubule-associated proteins) in vitro. In this paper we have shown that estramustine specifically binds MAP-1A in Du 145a cells, resulting in disruption of MAP-1A microtubules and inhibition of type IV collagenase secretion. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that at 30 microM levels estramustine blocked type IV collagenase secretion by partial disruption of the MAP-1A microtubule networks. Immunoprecipitation studies with polyclonal antibodies provided quantitative evidence that 30-60 microM estramustine blocked secretion of a 105 x 10(3) Mr type IV collagenase. Pulse-labeling experiments confirmed that the effect was not a result of inhibition of either protein synthesis or altered rates of type IV collagenase turnover. Finally, drug uptake studies with [3H]estramustine, scintillation counting and fluorography demonstrated that the principal target of the drug was MAP-1A. For the first time we have shown that the drug blocks secretion by binding MAP-1A and causing incomplete disruption of the microtubule networks.
23221868	Rufinamide attenuates mechanical allodynia in a model of neuropathic pain in the mouse and stabilizes voltage-gated sodium channel inactivated state.	BACKGROUND: Voltage-gated sodium channels dysregulation is important for hyperexcitability leading to pain persistence. Sodium channel blockers currently used to treat neuropathic pain are poorly tolerated. Getting new molecules to clinical use is laborious. We here propose a drug already marketed as anticonvulsant, rufinamide. METHODS: We compared the behavioral effect of rufinamide to amitriptyline using the Spared Nerve Injury neuropathic pain model in mice. We compared the effect of rufinamide on sodium currents using in vitro patch clamp in cells expressing the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7 isoform and on dissociated dorsal root ganglion neurons to amitriptyline and mexiletine. RESULTS: In naive mice, amitriptyline (20 mg/kg) increased withdrawal threshold to mechanical stimulation from 1.3 (0.6-1.9) (median [95% CI]) to 2.3 g (2.2-2.5) and latency of withdrawal to heat stimulation from 13.1 (10.4-15.5) to 30.0 s (21.8-31.9), whereas rufinamide had no effect. Rufinamide and amitriptyline alleviated injury-induced mechanical allodynia for 4 h (maximal effect: 0.10 +/- 0.03 g (mean +/- SD) to 1.99 +/- 0.26 g for rufinamide and 0.25 +/- 0.22 g to 1.92 +/- 0.85 g for amitriptyline). All drugs reduced peak current and stabilized the inactivated state of voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7, with similar effects in dorsal root ganglion neurons. CONCLUSIONS: At doses alleviating neuropathic pain, amitriptyline showed alteration of behavioral response possibly related to either alteration of basal pain sensitivity or sedative effect or both. Side-effects and drug tolerance/compliance are major problems with drugs such as amitriptyline. Rufinamide seems to have a better tolerability profile and could be a new alternative to explore for the treatment of neuropathic pain.
11986668	Minocycline inhibits cytochrome c release and delays progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in mice.	Minocycline mediates neuroprotection in experimental models of neurodegeneration. It inhibits the activity of caspase-1, caspase-3, inducible form of nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Although minocycline does not directly inhibit these enzymes, the effects may result from interference with upstream mechanisms resulting in their secondary activation. Because the above-mentioned factors are important in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we tested minocycline in mice with ALS. Here we report that minocycline delays disease onset and extends survival in ALS mice. Given the broad efficacy of minocycline, understanding its mechanisms of action is of great importance. We find that minocycline inhibits mitochondrial permeability-transition-mediated cytochrome c release. Minocycline-mediated inhibition of cytochrome c release is demonstrated in vivo, in cells, and in isolated mitochondria. Understanding the mechanism of action of minocycline will assist in the development and testing of more powerful and effective analogues. Because of the safety record of minocycline, and its ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, this drug may be a novel therapy for ALS.
23353698	ABT-737 resistance in B-cells isolated from chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients and leukemia cell lines is overcome by the pleiotropic kinase inhibitor quercetin through Mcl-1 down-regulation.	Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most frequent form of leukemia in adult population and despite numerous studies, it is considered an incurable disease. Since CLL is characterized by overexpression of pro-survival Bcl-2 family members, treatments with their antagonists, such as ABT-737, represent a promising new therapeutic strategy. ABT-737 is a BH3 mimetic agent which binds Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and Bcl-w with high affinity, while weakly interacts with Mcl-1 and Bfl-1. Previous studies demonstrated that quercetin, a flavonoid naturally present in food and beverages, was able to sensitize B-cells isolated from CLL patients to apoptosis when associated with death ligands or fludarabine, through a mechanism involving Mcl-1 down-regulation. Here, we report that the association between ABT-737 and quercetin synergistically induces apoptosis in B-cells and in five leukemic cell lines (Combination Index <1). Peripheral blood mononuclear cell from healthy donors were not affected by quercetin treatment. The molecular pathways triggered by quercetin have been investigated in HPB-ALL cells, characterized by the highest resistance to both ABT-737 and quercetin when applied as single molecules, but highly sensitivity to the co-treatment. In this cell line, quercetin down-regulated Mcl-1 through the inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, leading to Mcl-1 instability. The same mechanism was confirmed in B-cells. These results may open new clinical perspectives based on a translational approach in CLL therapy.
17537059	Plasma protein binding properties to immobilized heparin and heparin-albumin conjugate.	Selective adhesion of plasma proteins to immobilized heparin is considered to be beneficial regarding hemocompatibility of foreign materials in contact with blood. Prothrombin, thrombin, antithrombin III (AT3), and fibrinogen were selected for analysis in an experimental model. Biomolecular interaction analysis employing surface plasmon resonance was utilized to record and analyze their binding properties in real time. Biotinylated heparin, heparin-albumin conjugate, and albumin, respectively, were immobilized onto streptavidin-coated sensors as ligands. Prothrombin did not bind to any of the ligand surfaces and no specific binding of any of the plasma proteins to albumin was observed. Binding kinetics of thrombin to heparin and to heparin-albumin conjugate were calculated using two different methods. For heparin, identical K(D)(equilibrium dissociation constant) values of 61 x 10(-9) M were obtained with both methods. For the conjugate, only slightly different K(D) values of 111 x 10(-9) and 104 x 10(-9) M, respectively, were calculated. The affinity of thrombin toward the heparin-coated surface proved to be higher than its affinity toward the heparin conjugate. The binding pattern of AT3 to both heparin and heparin-albumin conjugate, although specific, was biphasic, possibly due to a conformational change during the binding process. Steady-state kinetic analysis revealed a K(D) value of 281 +/- 24 x 10(-9) M for the heparin surface. For the conjugate surface, a K(D) of 53 +/- 5 x 10(-9) M was calculated, indicating a higher affinity toward heparin-albumin conjugate. A high-affinity binding of fibrinogen to high-density surfaces of both heparin and the conjugate was observed. However, as binding to low-density surfaces was considerably reduced, specificity remained uncertain.
23017408	Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) enzyme activity and antioxidant properties of some cyanobacteria isolates.	In the present study, six cyanobacteria isolates were evaluated for the PAL enzyme activity, and their methanol extracts were assessed for the total phenolic amount and other antioxidant parameters. Synechocystis sp. BASO444 and Synechocystis sp. BASO673 isolates with high levels of total phenols (66.0±1.2μg/mg, 78.1±1.8μg/mg, respectively) also showed high levels of PAL activities (20.5±3.1U/mg protein, 17.2±2.3U/mg protein, respectively) and strong antioxidant activities. To understand the effect of l-phenylalanine (l-phe) on the PAL activity, total phenolic amount, and phenolic constituents, isolates were evaluated with 100mg/l l-phe. While PAL activities exhibited no significant change with l-phe addition, total phenolic amount of the isolates significantly increased. HPLC analysis revealed gallic acid, trans-cinnamic acid, p-coumaric acid, and ferulic acid as the main compounds. Results suggested that the two isolate mights be an important source for the l-phe inducible phenolic compounds.
1346768	Subtypes of alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors.	The adrenergic receptors are members of the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors. There are three major types of adrenergic receptors: alpha 1, alpha 2, and beta. Each of these three major types can be divided into three subtypes. Within the alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, alpha 1A and alpha 1B subtypes have been defined pharmacologically on the basis of reversible antagonists, such as WB4101 and phentolamine, and the irreversible antagonist chloroethylclonidine. In at least some tissues the mechanism of action of the alpha 1A subtype is related to activation of a calcium channel, whereas the alpha 1B receptor exerts its effect through the second messenger inositol trisphosphate. Both of these receptor subtypes as well as a third, the alpha 1C, have been identified by molecular cloning. Three pharmacological subtypes of the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor have also been identified. Prototypic tissues and cell lines in continuous culture have been developed for each of these subtypes, which facilitated their study. The definition of the alpha 2 subtypes has been based on radioligand binding data and more limited functional data. All three subtypes have been shown to inhibit the activation of adenylate cyclase and thus reduce the levels of cAMP. Three alpha 2-adrenergic receptor subtypes have been identified by molecular cloning in both the human and rat species. There is reasonable agreement between the pharmacological identified subtypes and those identified by molecular cloning.
11299519	Mutations in the follicle-stimulating hormone-beta (FSH beta) and FSH receptor genes in mice and humans.	Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), a dimeric glycoprotein synthesized in the anterior pituitary gland, is important for the production of sex steroids and gametes. FSH-beta (FSH beta) and FSH receptor (FSHR) knockout mice display impaired ovarian follicular development and infertility in females and small testes, oligospermia, and fertility in males. Humans with FSH beta gene mutations tend to have a more severe phenotype than those with FSHR gene mutations, although infertility and varying degrees of impaired sex steroid production occur in both types of mutations. Data from human and mouse mutations in the FSH beta and FSHR genes suggest that FSH is necessary for normal pubertal development and fertility in males and females.
23468082	Combined targeting of FGFR2 and mTOR by ponatinib and ridaforolimus results in synergistic antitumor activity in FGFR2 mutant endometrial cancer models.	PURPOSE: Activating mutations in FGFR2 have been identified as potential therapeutic targets in endometrial cancer, typically occurring alongside genetic alterations that disrupt the mTOR pathway, such as PTEN loss. These observations suggest that the mTOR pathway may act in concert with oncogenic FGFR2 to drive endometrial cancer growth in a subset of patients. The aim of this study was to examine the therapeutic potential of a rational drug combination based on the simultaneous targeting of mutant-FGFR2 and mTOR-driven signaling pathways in endometrial cancer cells. METHODS: Ponatinib is an oral multitargeted kinase inhibitor that potently inhibits all 4 members of the FGFR family. Ridaforolimus is a selective inhibitor of mTOR that has demonstrated positive clinical activity in endometrial cancer. The combinatorial effects of ponatinib and ridaforolimus on growth of endometrial cancer models, and their modes of action, were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: The combination of ponatinib and ridaforolimus had a synergistic effect on the in vitro growth of endometrial lines bearing an activating FGFR2 mutation, irrespective of PTEN status. Concomitant inhibition of both FGFR2 and mTOR signaling pathways was observed, with simultaneous blockade resulting in enhanced cell cycle arrest. Ponatinib and ridaforolimus each demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth in vivo, but dual inhibition by the combination of agents resulted in superior efficacy and induced tumor regression in an endometrial xenograft. CONCLUSIONS: These encouraging preclinical findings suggest the inhibition of both FGFR2 and mTOR by the ponatinib-ridaforolimus combination may provide a new therapeutic strategy to treat advanced endometrial cancers with dual pathway dysregulation.
23248200	Drug-drug interactions between rosuvastatin and oral antidiabetic drugs occurring at the level of OATP1B1.	Organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) is an important hepatic uptake transporter, of which the polymorphic variant OATP1B1*15 (Asn130Asp and Val174Ala) has been associated with decreased transport activity. Rosuvastatin is an OATP1B1 substrate and often concomitantly prescribed with oral antidiabetics in the clinic. The aim of this study was to investigate possible drug-drug interactions between these drugs at the level of OATP1B1 and OATP1B1*15. We generated human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells stably overexpressing OATP1B1 or OATP1B1*15 that showed similar protein expression levels of OATP1B1 and OATP1B1*15 at the cell membrane as measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In HEK-OATP1B1*15 cells, the V(max) for OATP1B1-mediated transport of E(2)17β-G (estradiol 17β-d-glucuronide) was decreased >60%, whereas K(m) values (Michaelis constant) were comparable. Uptake of rosuvastatin in HEK-OATP1B1 cells (K(m) 13.1 ± 0.43 μM) was nearly absent in HEK-OATP1B1*15 cells. Interestingly, several oral antidiabetics (glyburide, glimepiride, troglitazone, pioglitazone, glipizide, gliclazide, and tolbutamide), but not metformin, were identified as significant inhibitors of the OATP1B1-mediated transport of rosuvastatin. The IC(50) values for inhibition of E(2)17β-G uptake were similar between OATP1B1 and OATP1B1*15. In conclusion, these studies indicate that several oral antidiabetic drugs affect the OATP1B1-mediated uptake of rosuvastatin in vitro. The next step will be to translate these data to the clinical situation, as it remains to be established whether the studied oral antidiabetics indeed affect the clinical pharmacokinetic profile of rosuvastatin in patients.
21262851	Inhibition of recombinant L-type voltage-gated calcium channels by positive allosteric modulators of GABAA receptors.	Benzodiazepines (BDZs) depress neuronal excitability via positive allosteric modulation of inhibitory GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)R). BDZs and other positive GABA(A)R modulators, including barbiturates, ethanol, and neurosteroids, can also inhibit L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (L-VGCCs), which could contribute to reduced neuronal excitability. Because neuronal L-VGCC function is up-regulated after long-term GABA(A)R modulator exposure, an interaction with L-VGCCs may also play a role in physical dependence. The current studies assessed the effects of BDZs (diazepam, flurazepam, and desalkylflurazepam), allopregnanolone, pentobarbital, and ethanol on whole-cell Ba(2+) currents through recombinant neuronal Ca(v)1.2 and Ca(v)1.3 L-VGCCs expressed with beta(3) and alpha(2)delta-1 in HEK293T cells. Allopregnanolone was the most potent inhibitor (IC(50), approximately 10 muM), followed by BDZs (IC(50), approximately 50 muM), pentobarbital (IC(50), 0.3-1 mM), and ethanol (IC(50), approximately 300 mM). Ca(v)1.3 channels were less sensitive to pentobarbital inhibition than Ca(v)1.2 channels, similar to dihydropyridine (DHP) L-VGCC antagonists. All GABA(A)R modulators induced a negative shift in the steady-state inactivation curve of Ca(v)1.3 channels, but only BDZs and pentobarbital induced a negative shift in Ca(v)1.2 channel inactivation. Mutation of the high-affinity DHP binding site (T1039Y and Q1043M) in Ca(v)1.2 channels reduced pentobarbital potency. Despite the structural similarity between benzothiazepines and BDZs, mutation of an amino acid important for diltiazem potency (I1150A) did not affect diazepam potency. Although L-VGCC inhibition by BDZs occurred at concentrations that are possibly too high to be clinically relevant and is not likely to play a role in the up-regulation of L-VGCCs during long-term treatment, pentobarbital and ethanol inhibited L-VGCCs at clinically relevant concentrations.
23411259	A water-alcohol extract of Citrus grandis whole fruits has beneficial metabolic effects in the obese Zucker rats fed with high fat/high cholesterol diet.	Epidemiological studies suggest that citrus fruits and compounds such as flavonoids, limonoids and pectins have health promoting effects. Our aim was to study the effects of Citrus grandis (L.) Osbeck var. tomentosa hort. fruit extract on the energy metabolism. A whole fruit powder from dry water and alcohol extracts of C. grandis containing 19% naringin flavonoid was prepared. The effects of the citrus extract were followed in the obese Zucker rats fed with the HFD. The circulatory levels of GLP-1 decreased significantly by the extract in comparison to the HFD group, whereas the decreased ghrelin levels were reversed. The levels of PYY were decreased in all HFD groups. The leptin amounts decreased but not significantly whereas insulin and amylin were unchanged. The cholesterol and glucose levels were somewhat but not systematically improved in the HFD fed rats. Further studies are needed to identify the active compounds and their mechanisms.
23639187	Amelioration of palmitate-induced insulin resistance in C2C12 muscle cells by rooibos (Aspalathus linearis).	Increased levels of free fatty acids (FFAs), specifically saturated free fatty acids such as palmitate are associated with insulin resistance of muscle, fat and liver. Skeletal muscle, responsible for up to 80% of the glucose disposal from the peripheral circulation, is particularly vulnerable to increased levels of saturated FFAs. Rooibos (Aspalathus linearis) and its unique dihydrochalcone C-glucoside, aspalathin, shown to reduce hyperglycemia in diabetic rats, could play a role in preventing or ameliorating the development of insulin resistance. This study aims to establish whether rooibos can ameliorate experimentally-induced insulin-resistance in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. Palmitate-induced insulin resistant C2C12 cells were treated with an aspalathin-enriched green (unfermented) rooibos extract (GRE), previously shown for its blood glucose lowering effect in vitro and in vivo or an aqueous extract of fermented rooibos (FRE). Glucose uptake and mitochondrial activity were measured using 2-deoxy-[(3)H]-d-glucose, MTT and ATP assays, respectively. Expression of proteins relevant to glucose metabolism was analysed by Western blot. GRE contained higher levels of all compounds, except the enolic phenylpyruvic acid-2-O-glucoside and luteolin-7-O-glucoside. Both rooibos extracts increased glucose uptake, mitochondrial activity and ATP production. Compared to FRE, GRE was more effective at increasing glucose uptake and ATP production. At a mechanistic level both extracts down-regulated PKC θ activation, which is associated with palmitate-induced insulin resistance. Furthermore, the extracts increased activation of key regulatory proteins (AKT and AMPK) involved in insulin-dependent and non-insulin regulated signalling pathways. Protein levels of the glucose transporter (GLUT4) involved in glucose transport via these two pathways were also increased. This in vitro study therefore confirms that rooibos can ameliorate palmitate-induced insulin resistance in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. Inhibition of PKC θ activation and increased activation of AMPK and AKT offer a plausible mechanistic explanation for this ameliorative effect.
23019138	Diuretic effects of cannabinoids.	In vivo effects of cannabinoid (CB) agonists are often assessed using four well-established measures: locomotor activity, hypothermia, cataleptic-like effects, and analgesia. The present studies demonstrate that doses of CB agonists that produce these effects also reliably increase diuresis. Diuretic effects of several CB agonists were measured in female rats over 2 hours immediately after drug injection, and results were compared with hypothermic effects. Direct-acting CB1 agonists, including Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol, WIN 55,212 [R-(1)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-[(morpholinyl)methyl]pyrrolo[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazinyl]-(1-naphthalenyl)methanone mesylate], AM2389 [9β-hydroxy-3-(1-hexyl-cyclobut-1-yl)-hexahydrocannabinol], and AM4054 [9β-(hydroxymethyl)-3-(1-adamantyl)-hexahydrocannabinol], produced dose-dependent increases in diuresis and decreases in colonic temperature, with slightly lower ED(50) values for diuresis than for hypothermia. The highest doses of cannabinoid drugs yielded, on average, 26-32 g/kg urine; comparable effects were obtained with 10 mg/kg furosemide and 3.0 mg/kg trans-(-)-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexyl]benzeneacetamide (U50-488). Methanandamide (10.0 mg/kg) had lesser effect than other CB agonists, and the CB2 agonist AM1241 [1-(methylpiperidin-2-ylmethyl)-3-(2-iodo-5-nitrobenzoyl)indole], the anandamide transport inhibitor AM404, and the CB antagonist rimonabant did not have diuretic effects. In further studies, the diuretic effects of the CB1 agonist AM4054 were similar in male and female rats, displayed a relatively rapid onset to action, and were dose-dependently antagonized by 30 minutes pretreatment with rimonabant, but not by the vanilloid receptor type I antagonist capsazepine, nor were the effects of WIN 55,212 antagonized by the CB2 antagonist AM630 [(6-iodo-2-methyl-1-[2-(4-morpholinyl)ethyl]-1H-indol-3-yl](4-methoxyphenyl) methanone)]. These data indicate that cannabinoids have robust diuretic effects in rats that are mediated via CB1 receptor mechanisms.
10768298	Topiramate as an inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase isoenzymes.	PURPOSE: This study investigated the effectiveness of topiramate (TPM) as an inhibitor of six isozymes of carbonic anhydrase (CA). METHODS: The inhibition constants (Ki) of TPM and acetazolamide (AZM) for CA I, CA II, CA III, CA IV, CA V, and CA VI were determined for human (HCA), rat (RCA), or mouse (MCA). The activity of CA was studied by using purified isozymes, erythrocytes, subcellular fractions of kidney or brain, and saliva, and was assayed at 37 degrees C or 25 degrees C by 18O mass spectrometry and/or by measuring the pH shift at 0 degrees C. RESULTS: Topiramate Ki values for HCA I, HCA II, HCA IV, and HCA VI were approximately 100, 7, 10, and >100 microM, respectively. TPM Ki values for RCA I, RCA II, RCA III, RCA IV, and RCA V were approximately 180, 0.1 to 1, >100, 0.2 to 10 and 18 microM, respectively. For RCA II and RCA IV, the Ki values were temperature dependent. TPM Ki values for MCA II and MCA IV ranged between 1 and 20 microM. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that TPM is more potent as an inhibitor of CA II and CA IV than of CA I, CA III, and CA VI. In all three species, AZM was usually 10 to 100 times more potent than TPM as an inhibitor of CA isozymes.
23319584	Comparison of orientation and rotational motion of skeletal muscle cross-bridges containing phosphorylated and dephosphorylated myosin regulatory light chain.	Calcium binding to thin filaments is a major element controlling active force generation in striated muscles. Recent evidence suggests that processes other than Ca(2+) binding, such as phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain (RLC) also controls contraction of vertebrate striated muscle (Cooke, R. (2011) Biophys. Rev. 3, 33-45). Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies using nucleotide analog spin label probes showed that dephosphorylated myosin heads are highly ordered in the relaxed fibers and have very low ATPase activity. This ordered structure of myosin cross-bridges disappears with the phosphorylation of RLC (Stewart, M. (2010) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 107, 430-435). The slower ATPase activity in the dephosporylated moiety has been defined as a new super-relaxed state (SRX). It can be observed in both skeletal and cardiac muscle fibers (Hooijman, P., Stewart, M. A., and Cooke, R. (2011) Biophys. J. 100, 1969-1976). Given the importance of the finding that suggests a novel pathway of regulation of skeletal muscle, we aim to examine the effects of phosphorylation on cross-bridge orientation and rotational motion. We find that: (i) relaxed cross-bridges, but not active ones, are statistically better ordered in muscle where the RLC is dephosporylated compared with phosphorylated RLC; (ii) relaxed phosphorylated and dephosphorylated cross-bridges rotate equally slowly; and (iii) active phosphorylated cross-bridges rotate considerably faster than dephosphorylated ones during isometric contraction but the duty cycle remained the same, suggesting that both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated muscles develop the same isometric tension at full Ca(2+) saturation. A simple theory was developed to account for this fact.
15494548	Valdecoxib: assessment of cyclooxygenase-2 potency and selectivity.	The discovery of a second isoform of cyclooxygenase (COX) led to the search for compounds that could selectively inhibit COX-2 in humans while sparing prostaglandin formation from COX-1. Celecoxib and rofecoxib were among the molecules developed from these efforts. We report here the pharmacological properties of a third selective COX-2 inhibitor, valdecoxib, which is the most potent and in vitro selective of the marketed COX-2 inhibitors that we have studied. Recombinant human COX-1 and COX-2 were used to screen for new highly potent and in vitro selective COX-2 inhibitors and compare kinetic mechanisms of binding and enzyme inhibition with other COX inhibitors. Valdecoxib potently inhibits recombinant COX-2, with an IC(50) of 0.005 microM; this compares with IC values of 0.05 microM for celecoxib, 0.5 microM for rofecoxib, and 5 microM for etoricoxib. Unique binding interactions of valdecoxib with COX-2 translate into a fast rate of inactivation of COX-2 (110,000 M/s compared with 7000 M/s for rofecoxib and 80 M/s for etoricoxib). The overall saturation binding affinity for COX-2 of valdecoxib is 2.6 nM (compared with 1.6 nM for celecoxib, 51 nM for rofecoxib, and 260 nM for etoricoxib), with a slow off-rate (t(1/2) approximately 98 min). Valdecoxib inhibits COX-1 in a competitive fashion only at very high concentrations (IC(50) = 150 microM). Collectively, these data provide a mechanistic basis for the potency and in vitro selectivity of valdecoxib for COX-2. Valdecoxib showed similar activity in the human whole-blood COX assay (COX-2 IC(50) = 0.24 microM; COX-1 IC(50) = 21.9 microM). We also determined whether this in vitro potency and selectivity translated to significant potency in vivo. In rats, valdecoxib demonstrated marked potency in acute and chronic models of inflammation (air pouch ED(50) = 0.06 mg/kg; paw edema ED(50) = 5.9 mg/kg; adjuvant arthritis ED(50) = 0.03 mg/kg). In these same animals, COX-1 was spared at doses greater than 200 mg/kg. These data provide a basis for the observed potent anti-inflammatory activity of valdecoxib in humans.
23403085	Neuroprotective effects of mercaptoethylleonurine and mercaptoethylguanidine analogs on hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis in human neuronal SH-SY5Y cells.	A series of mercaptoethylleonurine and mercaptoethylguanidine derivatives were designed and synthesized. Their neuroprotective effects toward H2O2-induced apoptosis were investigated in human SH-SY5Y cells. The results from these studies identified several potent compounds, with compound 8k emerging as the most effective. Further investigation demonstrated that 8k reduced H2O2-induced activation of mitochondrial apoptosis by inhibiting the expression of Bax and elevating the expression of Bcl-2. Moreover, the molecular mechanism underlying the observed neuroprotective effects of 8k was exerted via the Akt and JNK pathways. Compound 8k can be a lead compound for further discovery of neuroprotective medicine.
9587066	"The molecular genetic approach to ""Bartter's syndrome""."	"The term ""Bartter's syndrome"" comprises a set of autosomal recessively inherited renal tubular disorders characterized by hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, hyperreninism, and hyperaldosteronism but normal blood pressure. Additional clinical and biochemical features led to a classification into phenotypically different tubulopathies: Gitelman's syndrome, hyperprostaglandin E syndrome (antenatal Bartter's syndrome), and classic Bartter's syndrome. Gitelman's syndrome results from mutations in the SLC12A3 gene encoding the human thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride cotransporter, leading to impaired reabsorption of sodium chloride in the distal convoluted tubule. Genetic heterogeneity of hyperprostaglandin E syndrome has been demonstrated by identification of mutations in the SLC12A1 gene as well as in the KCNJ1 gene. Mutations in SLC12A1 coding for the bumetanide-sensitive sodium potassium 2 chloride cotransporter (NKCC2) cause defective reabsorption of sodium chloride in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop. Mutations in KCNJ1 leading to loss of function of the potassium channel ROMK disrupt potassium recycling back to the tubule lumen and inhibit thereby the NKCC2 activity. A third gene for hyperprostaglandin E syndrome has been mapped to the short arm of chromosome 1, and it remains to be evaluated whether other genes are involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. Classic Bartter's syndrome has been demonstrated to result from defective chloride transport across the basolateral membrane in the distal nephron due to mutations in the chloride channel gene CLCNKB. This article reviews the molecular genetic approach that has led to identification of genetic defects underlying the different hypokalemic tubulopathies."
23472952	Discovery of (R)-2-amino-6-borono-2-(2-(piperidin-1-yl)ethyl)hexanoic acid and congeners as highly potent inhibitors of human arginases I and II for treatment of myocardial reperfusion injury.	Recent efforts to identify treatments for myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury have resulted in the discovery of a novel series of highly potent α,α-disubstituted amino acid-based arginase inhibitors. The lead candidate, (R)-2-amino-6-borono-2-(2-(piperidin-1-yl)ethyl)hexanoic acid, compound 9, inhibits human arginases I and II with IC50s of 223 and 509 nM, respectively, and is active in a recombinant cellular assay overexpressing human arginase I (CHO cells). It is 28% orally bioavailable and significantly reduces the infarct size in a rat model of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. Herein, we report the design, synthesis, and structure-activity relationships (SAR) for this novel series of inhibitors along with pharmacokinetic and in vivo efficacy data for compound 9 and X-ray crystallography data for selected lead compounds cocrystallized with arginases I and II.
23270282	Differential Effects of Crambescins and Crambescidin 816 in Voltage-Gated Sodium, Potassium and Calcium Channels in Neurons.	Crambescins and crambescidins are two families of guanidine alkaloids from the marine sponge Crambe crambe. Although very little information about their biological effect has been reported, it is known that crambescidin 816 (Cramb816) blocks calcium channels in a neuroblastoma X glioma cell line. Taking this into account, and the fact that ion channels are frequent targets for natural toxins, we examined the effect of Cramb816 and three compounds from the crambescin family, norcrambescin A2 (NcrambA2), crambescin A2 (CrambA2), and crambescin C1 (CrambC1), in the main voltage-dependent ion channels in neurons: sodium, potassium, and calcium channels. Electrophysiological recordings of voltage gated sodium, potassium, and calcium currents, in the presence of these guanidine alkaloids, were performed in cortical neurons from embryonic mice. Different effects were discovered: crambescins inhibited K(+) currents with the following potency: NcrambA2 > CrambC1 > CrambA2, while Cramb816 lacked an effect. Only CrambC1 and Cramb816 partially blocked Na(+) total current. However, Cramb816 partially blocked Ca(2+) , while NcrambA2 did not. Since the blocking effect of Cramb816 on calcium currents has not been previously reported in detail, we further pharmacologically isolated the two main fractions of HVA Ca(2+) channels in neurons and investigated the Cramb816 effect on them. Here, we revealed that Cav1 or L-type calcium channels are the main target for Cramb816. These two families of guanidine alkaloids clearly showed a structure-activity relationship with the crambescins acting on voltage-gated potassium channels, while Cramb816 blocks the voltage-gated calcium channel Cav1 with higher potency than nifedipine. The novel evidence that Cramb816 partially blocked Ca(V) and Na(V) channels in neurons suggests that this compound might be involved in decreasing the neurotransmitter release and synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. The findings presented here provide the first detailed approach on the different effects of crambescin and crambescidin compounds in voltage-gated sodium, potassium, and calcium channels in neurons and thus provide a basis for future studies.
12016548	Hepatotoxicity of commonly used drugs: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antihypertensives, antidiabetic agents, anticonvulsants, lipid-lowering agents, psychotropic drugs.	"Hepatotoxic adverse drug reactions have contributed to the decline of many promising therapies, even among mainstream medication classes (bromfenac and troglitazone are recent examples). The spectrum of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-related liver toxicity continues to expand, with reports in children, interactive toxicity in persons with hepatitis C, and recognition of the toxicity of both the preferential and selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors. Of the antihypertensive agents, methyldopa is now rarely prescribed and adverse effects are reported infrequently, whereas cases of liver injury associated with the angiotensin receptor and converting enzyme inhibitors are increasingly reported. Of the antidiabetic agents, acarbose, gliclazide, metformin, and human insulin have been implicated in causing liver injury. To date, the newer thiazolidinediones do not appear to share the hepatotoxic potential of troglitazone, although a few reports of acute hepatitis have accrued. Although liver injury has been associated with the ""statins,"" the frequency of such toxicity is lower than that of the background population and the value of biochemical monitoring remains unproved. Newer concepts in anticonvulsant hepatotoxicity have been the recognition of the reactive metabolite syndrome, delineation of the risk factors for valproic acid toxicity, the potential role of carnitine in preventing valproic acid hepatotoxicity, and the toxicity of second-line antiepileptic drugs. Liver injury associated with newer psychotropic agents, particularly the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, is also discussed. The focus of the review is the hepatotoxicity of commonly used drugs with particular reference to recent and novel reports of toxicity. Well-known causes of liver injury such as chlorpromazine, phenytoin, and methyldopa are not discussed."
8398139	A novel adenylyl cyclase-activating serotonin receptor (5-HT7) implicated in the regulation of mammalian circadian rhythms.	"We report the cloning and characterization of a novel serotonin receptor, designated as 5-HT7, which is coupled to the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. 5-HT7 mRNA is expressed discretely throughout the CNS, predominantly in the thalamus and hypothalamus. 5-HT7 has a unique pharmacological profile that redefines agonist and antagonist classification of ligands previously thought to be ""selective."" The circadian phase of spontaneous neuronal activity of the rat suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus advances in response to serotonin ligands with a pharmacological profile consistent exclusively with that of 5-HT7. These findings suggest a physiological role in the regulation of circadian rhythms for one subtype of serotonin receptor, 5-HT7, and provide a pharmacological test to evaluate its role in other neuronal systems."
20618322	Copy number variations of the human histamine H4 receptor gene are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus.	BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex genetic disease; the histamine H4 receptor (HRH4) has been shown to be related to different kinds of autoimmune disorders; and copy number variations (CNVs) have been found to be associated with various types of diseases. OBJECTIVES: To explore a possible association between HRH4 (formerly H4R) CNVs and the risk of SLE. METHODS: Genomic DNA and RNA from 340 patients with SLE and 392 healthy controls were extracted, and CNVs and mRNA levels of HRH4 were examined. RESULTS: The expression of HRH4 mRNA was significantly increased in patients with SLE compared with controls. Amplification of HRH4 copy numbers significantly increased the risk of SLE [P < 0.001, odds ratio (OR) 2.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.50-3.40]. HRH4 amplifications also positively correlated with the incidence of arthritis (P = 0.019, OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.11-3.47), and proteinuria (P < 0.001, OR 2.95, 95% CI 1.73-5.00) and antinuclear antibody abnormalities (P < 0.001, OR 2.97, 95% CI 1.66-5.33). Deletions of HRH4 copy numbers were protective against proteinuria (P = 0.03, OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.26-0.94). CONCLUSION: CNVs of the HRH4 gene are associated with SLE.
19057128	Captopril attenuates matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 in monocrotaline-induced right ventricular hypertrophy in rats.	Little is known about the influence of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) in right ventricular remodeling. We investigated the effect of captopril, an ACE inhibitor, on MMP-2 and MMP-9 in monocrotaline-induced right ventricular hypertrophy. Six-week-old male Wistar rats were injected intraperitoneally with monocrotaline (60 mg/kg) or saline. The rats were administrated captopril (30 mg/kg per day) or a vehicle orally for 24 days from the day of monocrotaline injection. At day 25, echocardiography was performed and hearts were excised. Expressions and activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were measured by Western blotting and by gelatin zymography, respectively. In monocrotaline-injected rats, right ventricular weight/tail length ratio increased significantly. Histological analysis revealed cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis in right ventricular sections. Echocardiography showed right ventricular dysfunction compared with saline-injected rats. The right ventricular hypertrophy, fibrosis, and dysfunction were inhibited by captopril. However, captopril did not attenuate an increase in pulmonary artery pressure. MMP-2 and MMP-9 expressions and activities in right ventricles increased significantly in monocrotaline-injected rats and captopril inhibited them. These findings indicate that captopril attenuates the development of monocrotaline-induced right ventricular hypertrophy in association with inhibition of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in rats.
23393216	Decreased serum concentrations of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol are associated with increased risk of progression to impaired fasting glucose and diabetes.	OBJECTIVE To study the association between vitamin D status and the risk of incident impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and diabetes in a population-based cohort of diabetes-free subjects. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In a historical prospective cohort study of subjects from the Clalit Health Services database, which includes information on nearly 4 million people, diabetes-free subjects aged 40-70 years with serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25-OHD) measurements available were followed for 2 years to assess the development of IFG and diabetes in five 25-OHD subgroups: ≥25, 25.1-37.5, 37.6-50, 50.1-75, and >75 nmol/L. RESULTS The baseline cohort included 117,960 adults: 83,526 normoglycemic subjects and 34,434 subjects with IFG. During follow-up, 8,629 subjects (10.3% of the normoglycemic group) developed IFG, and 2,162 subjects (1.8% of the total cohort) progressed to diabetes. A multivariable model adjusted for age, sex, population group, immigrant status, BMI, season of vitamin D measurement, LDL and HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, estimated glomerular filtration rate, history of hypertension or cardiovascular disease, Charlson comorbidity index, smoking, and socioeconomic status revealed an inverse association between 25-OHD and the risk of progression to IFG and diabetes. The odds of transitioning from normoglycemia to IFG, from normoglycemia to diabetes, and from IFG to diabetes in subjects with a 25-OHD level ≤25 nmol/L were greater than those of subjects with a 25-OHD level >75 nmol/L [odds ratio 1.13 (95% CI 1.03-1.24), 1.77 (1.11-2.83), and 1.43 (1.16-1.76), respectively]. CONCLUSIONS Vitamin D deficiency appears to be an independent risk factor for the development of IFG and diabetes.
23362262	Transforming growth factor β integrates Smad 3 to mechanistic target of rapamycin complexes to arrest deptor abundance for glomerular mesangial cell hypertrophy.	In many renal diseases, transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)-stimulated canonical Smad 3 and noncanonical mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) promote increased protein synthesis and mesangial cell hypertrophy. The cellular underpinnings involving these signaling molecules to regulate mesangial cell hypertrophy are not fully understood. Deptor has recently been identified as an mTOR interacting protein and functions as an endogenous inhibitor of the kinase activity for both TORC1 and TORC2. Prolonged incubation of mesangial cells with TGFβ reduced the levels of deptor concomitant with an increase in TORC1 and TORC2 activity. Sustained TGFβ activation was required to inhibit association of deptor with mTOR, whereas rapid activation had no effect. Using the mTOR inhibitor PP242, we found that TGFβ-induced both early and sustained activation of TORC1 and TORC2 was necessary for deptor suppression. PP242-induced reversal of deptor suppression by TGFβ was associated with a significant inhibition of TGFβ-stimulated protein synthesis and hypertrophy. Interestingly, expression of siRNA against Smad 3 or Smad 7, which blocks TGFβ receptor-specific Smad 3 signaling, prevented TGFβ-induced suppression of deptor abundance and TORC1/2 activities. Furthermore, overexpression of Smad 3 decreased deptor expression similar to TGFβ stimulation concomitant with increased TORC1 and TORC2 activities. Finally, knockdown of deptor reversed Smad 7-mediated inhibition of protein synthesis and mesangial cell hypertrophy induced by TGFβ. These data reveal the requirement of both early and late activation of mTOR for TGFβ-induced protein synthesis. Our results support that TGFβ-stimulated Smad 3 acts as a key node to instill a feedback loop between deptor down-regulation and TORC1/2 activation in driving mesangial cell hypertrophy.
23256441	Bamboo salt has in vitro anticancer activity in HCT-116 cells and exerts anti-metastatic effects in vivo.	Bamboo salt is a traditional food widely used in Korea. The in vitro anticancer effects of this salt were evaluated in HCT-116 human colon cancer cells using a 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. A 1% salt concentration of bamboo salt baked nine times (9×) inhibited the growth of HCT-116 cells by 53%, which was higher than salt baked three times (3×) or once (1×; 44% and 41%, respectively) and much higher than solar sea salt (Korean sea salt) and purified salt (22% and 18%, respectively). To elucidate the inhibitory mechanisms underlying the anticancer effect of the salt samples in cancer cells, expression of genes associated with apoptosis, inflammation, and metastasis was measured with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. Bamboo salt (9×) significantly induced apoptosis in cancer cells (P<.05) by upregulating Bax, caspase-9, and caspase-3, and downregulating Bcl-2. The expression of genes associated with inflammation (NF-κB, iNOS, and COX-2) was significantly downregulated (P<.05) by 9× bamboo salt, demonstrating its anti-inflammatory properties. The 9× bamboo salt also exerted a greater anti-metastatic effect on cancer cells than the other salts as demonstrated by decreased mRNA expression of MMP genes and increased expression of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, which was confirmed by the inhibition of tumor metastasis induced in colon 26-M3.1 cells in BALB/c mice. In contrast, purified and solar salts increased metastasis in the mice. Our results demonstrated that 9× bamboo salt had the most potent in vitro anticancer effect, induced apoptosis, had anti-inflammatory activities, and exerted in vivo anti-metastatic effects. Additionally, the anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and anti-metastatic effects of the 1× and 3× bamboo salts were stronger than those of the purified and solar salts.
16985933	Gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist in the management of prostate cancer.	"Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist therapy to induce medical castration has become the most common form of hormonal therapy for advanced and metastatic prostate cancer. When treatment is started, LHRH agonists initially stimulate the release of LH, causing a surge in serum testosterone that can precipitate a ""flare"" phenomenon or worsening of disease, particularly in patients with bone metastatic disease. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonism represents a newer approach to medical castration. Abarelix is a pure GnRH receptor antagonist that is devoid of any LHRH agonist activity. Results from 1 phase II and 3 phase III clinical trials demonstrate that abarelix produces medical castration more quickly and without causing testosterone surge, as compared with LHRH agonists with or without a nonsteroidal antagonist. The safety profile in terms of adverse events is comparable between the 2 types of treatment, but the lack of testosterone surge with abarelix might confer a safety advantage by abolishing the risk of a disease flare."
19302827	Novel signaling pathways promote a paracrine wave of prostacyclin-induced vascular smooth muscle differentiation.	The important athero-protective role of prostacyclin is becoming increasingly evident as recent studies have revealed adverse cardiovascular effects in mice lacking the prostacyclin receptor, in patients taking selective COX-2 inhibitors, and in patients in the presence of a dysfunctional prostacyclin receptor genetic variant. We have recently reported that this protective mechanism includes the promotion of a quiescent differentiated phenotype in human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Herein, we address the intriguing question of how localized endothelial release of the very unstable eicosanoid, prostacyclin, exerts a profound effect on the vascular media, often 30 cell layers thick. We report a novel PKA-, Akt-1- and ERK1/2-dependent prostacyclin-induced prostacyclin release that appears to play an important role in propagation of the quiescent, differentiated phenotype through adjacent arterial smooth muscle cells in the vascular media. Treating VSMC with the prostacyclin analog iloprost induced differentiation (contractile protein expression and contractile morphology), and also up-regulated COX-2 expression, leading to prostacyclin release by VSMC. This paracrine prostacyclin release, in turn, promoted differentiation and COX-2 induction in neighboring VSMC that were not exposed to iloprost. Using siRNA and pharmacologic inhibitors, we report that this positive feedback mechanism, prostacyclin-induced prostacyclin release, is mediated by cAMP/PKA signaling, ERK1/2 activation, and a novel prostacyclin receptor signaling pathway, inhibition of Akt-1. Furthermore, these pathways appear to be regulated by the prostacyclin receptor independently of one another. We conclude that prevention of de-differentiation and proliferation through a paracrine positive feedback mechanism is a major cardioprotective function of prostacyclin.
23274909	Nogo-a downregulation improves insulin secretion in mice.	Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterized by β-cell dysfunction and the subsequent depletion of insulin production, usually in a context of increased peripheral insulin resistance. T2D patients are routinely treated with oral antidiabetic agents such as sulfonylureas or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 antagonists, which promote glucose- and incretin-dependent insulin secretion, respectively. Interestingly, insulin secretion may also be induced by neural stimulation. Here we report the expression of Nogo-A in β-cells. Nogo-A is a membrane protein that inhibits neurite outgrowth and cell migration in the central nervous system. We observed that Nogo-A-deficient mice display improved insulin secretion and glucose clearance. This was associated with a stronger parasympathetic input and higher sensitivity of β-cells to the cholinergic analog carbachol. Insulin secretion was also improved in diabetic db/db mice treated with neutralizing antibody against Nogo-A. Together, these findings suggest that promoting the vagal stimulation of insulin secretion through the selective inhibition of Nogo-A could be a novel therapeutic approach in T2D.
12185406	Bupropion occupancy of the dopamine transporter is low during clinical treatment.	RATIONALE: Bupropion is thought to treat major depression by blocking the dopamine transporter (DAT) because bupropion appears to have a selective affinity for the DAT. The validity of this mechanism has been questioned because the affinity of bupropion for the DAT is quite low. OBJECTIVE: To determine the occupancy of bupropion for the DAT during clinical treatment of patients with depression. METHODS: Positron emission tomography with [(11)C]-RTI32 was used to determine the striatal DAT binding potential (BP) of eight depressed patients before and during treatment with bupropion. BP is proportional to available receptor density (receptors not blocked by drug). Occupancy is the percent change in BP. Eight healthy subjects were similarly studied in a test-retest design. RESULTS: No significant difference in DAT BP was found after bupropion treatment in comparison to the test-retest data. The occupancy after bupropion treatment was 14% (confidence interval 6-22%) as compared to 7% in the test-retest condition. CONCLUSIONS: Bupropion treatment occupies less than 22% of DAT sites. This raises the question as to whether a DAT occupancy of less than 22% is therapeutic or whether there is another mechanism involved during treatment with bupropion.
23395003	Fbxl10/Kdm2b recruits polycomb repressive complex 1 to CpG islands and regulates H2A ubiquitylation.	Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) catalyzes lysine 119 monoubiquitylation on H2A (H2AK119ub1) and regulates pluripotency in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). However, the mechanisms controlling the binding of PRC1 to genomic sites and its catalytic activity are poorly understood. Here, we show that Fbxl10 interacts with Ring1B and Nspc1, forming a noncanonical PRC1 that is required for H2AK119ub1 in mouse ESCs. Genome-wide analyses reveal that Fbxl10 preferentially binds to CpG islands and colocalizes with Ring1B on Polycomb target genes. Notably, Fbxl10 depletion causes a decrease in Ring1B binding to target genes and a major loss of H2AK119ub1. Furthermore, genetic analyses demonstrate that Fbxl10 DNA binding capability and integration into PRC1 are required for H2AK119 ubiquitylation. ESCs lacking Fbxl10, like previously characterized Polycomb mutants, cannot differentiate properly. These results demonstrate that Fbxl10 has a key role in regulating Ring1B recruitment to its target genes and H2AK119 ubiquitylation in ESCs.
23386248	Refining the UGT1A haplotype associated with irinotecan-induced hematological toxicity in metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with 5-fluorouracil/irinotecan-based regimens.	Despite the importance of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1*28 in irinotecan pharmacogenetics, our capability to predict drug-induced severe toxicity remains limited. We aimed at identifying novel genetic markers that would improve prediction of irinotecan toxicity and response in advanced colorectal cancer patients treated with folic acid (leucovorin), fluorouracil (5-FU), and irinotecan (camptosar)-based regimens. The relationships between UGT1A candidate markers across the gene (n = 21) and toxicity were prospectively evaluated in 167 patients. We included variants in the 3'untranscribed region (3'UTR) of the UGT1A locus, not studied in this context yet. These genetic markers were further investigated in 250 Italian FOLFIRI-treated patients. Several functional UGT1A variants, including UGT1A1*28, significantly influenced risk of severe hematologic toxicity. As previously reported in the Italian cohort, a 5-marker risk haplotype [haplotype II (HII); UGTs 1A9/1A7/1A1] was associated with severe neutropenia in our cohort [odds ratio (OR) = 2.43; P = 0.004]. The inclusion of a 3'UTR single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) permitted refinement of the previously defined HI, in which HIa was associated with the absence of severe neutropenia in combined cohorts (OR = 0.55; P = 0.038). Among all tested UGT1A variations and upon multivariate analyses, no UGT1A1 SNPs remained significant, whereas three SNPs located in the central region of UGT1A were linked to neutropenia grade 3-4. Haplotype analyses of these markers with the 3'UTR SNP allowed the identification of a protective HI (OR = 0.50; P = 0.048) and two risk haplotypes, HII and HIII, characterized by 2 and 3 unfavorable alleles, respectively, revealing a dosage effect (ORs of 2.15 and 5.28; P ≤ 0.030). Our results suggest that specific SNPs in UGT1A, other than UGT1A1*28, may influence irinotecan toxicity and should be considered to refine pharmacogenetic testing.
17353078	Fluvastatin ameliorates endotoxin induced multiple organ failure in conscious rats.	OBJECTIVES: Sepsis is a severe inflammatory disorder that may lead to multiple organ failure. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is associated with Gram-negative sepsis and can activate monocytes and macrophages to release pro-inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), nitric oxide (NO) and anti-inflammatory mediator such as interleukin-10 (IL-10). In this present study, we used fluvastatin, a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, to study its effects upon LPS-induced endotoxic shock in conscious rats. METHODS: The experiments were designed that rats received an intravenous injection of 1mg/kg fluvastatin followed 10min later, by an intravenous injection of 10mg/kg Klebsiella pneumoniae LPS, the latter inducing endotoxic shock amongst conscious rats. Subsequently, the levels of certain biochemical variables and cytokines in serum were then measured during the ensuing 48-h period following sepsis. These included total cholesterol (TCH), triglyceride (TG), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cre), creatine phosphokinase (CPK), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate transferase (GOT), alanine transferase (GPT), tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-10 and nitric oxide. RESULTS: LPS significantly increased blood TG, BUN, Cre, LDH, CPK, GOT, GPT, TNF-alpha, IL-10 and NO levels but decreased the blood TCH level. Pretreatment of test rats with fluvastatin decreased blood levels of certain markers of organ injury, suppressed the release of TNF-alpha and increased IL-10, and NO levels following LPS treatment. Fluvastatin did not affect the blood TCH and TG level subsequent to the development of sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-treatment with fluvastatin suppresses the release of plasma TNF-alpha, increases plasma IL-10, and NO production, and decreases the levels of markers of organ injury associated with endotoxic shock, so ameliorating LPS-induced organ damage amongst conscious rats.
17277115	Regulation of CD8+ T lymphocyte effector function and macrophage inflammatory cytokine production by retinoic acid receptor gamma.	Vitamin A and its derivatives regulate a broad array of immune functions. The effects of these retinoids are mediated through members of retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors. However, the role of individual retinoid receptors in the pleiotropic effects of retinoids remains unclear. To dissect the role of these receptors in the immune system, we analyzed immune cell development and function in mice conditionally lacking RARgamma, the third member of the RAR family. We show that RARgamma is dispensable for T and B lymphocyte development, the humoral immune response to a T-dependent Ag and in vitro Th cell differentiation. However, RARgamma-deficient mice had a defective primary and memory CD8(+) T cell response to Listeria monocytogenes infection. Unexpectedly, RARgamma-deficient macrophages exhibited impaired inflammatory cytokine production upon TLR stimulation. These results suggest that under physiological condition, RARgamma is a positive regulator of inflammatory cytokine production.
23230281	Increased oxidized low-density lipoprotein causes blood-brain barrier disruption in early-onset preeclampsia through LOX-1.	Early-onset preeclampsia (EPE) is a severe form of preeclampsia that involves life-threatening neurological complications. However, the underlying mechanism by which EPE affects the maternal brain is not known. We hypothesized that plasma from women with EPE increases blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability vs. plasma from women with late-onset preeclampsia (LPE) or normal pregnancy (NP) and investigated its underlying mechanism by perfusing cerebral veins from nonpregnant rats (n=6-7/group) with human plasma from women with EPE, LPE, or NP and measuring permeability. We show that plasma from women with EPE significantly increased BBB permeability vs. plasma from women with LPE or NP (P<0.001). BBB disruption in response to EPE plasma was due to a 260% increase of circulating oxidized LDL (oxLDL) binding to its receptor, LOX-1, and subsequent generation of peroxynitrite (P<0.001). A rat model with pathologically high lipid levels in pregnancy showed symptoms of preeclampsia, including elevated blood pressure, growth-restricted fetuses, and LOX-1-dependent BBB disruption, similar to EPE (P<0.05). Thus, we have identified LOX-1 activation by oxLDL and subsequent peroxynitrite generation as a novel mechanism by which disruption of the BBB occurs in EPE. As increased BBB permeability is a primary means by which seizure and other neurological symptoms ensue, our findings highlight oxLDL, LOX-1, and peroxynitrite as important therapeutic targets in EPE.
17197042	Development and validation of a non-radioactive DNA polymerase assay for studying cytomegalovirus resistance to foscarnet.	Phenotypic characterisation of the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) pUL54 DNA polymerase is a useful tool for testing for mutations in the UL54 gene thought to render HCMV resistant to foscarnet. In this study, an in-house non-isotopic method for assessing polymerase enzymatic activity in the presence and absence of foscarnet was developed and its utility for HCMV polymerase phenotyping evaluated. Polymerase activity was assessed by monitoring the incorporation of digoxigenin-labelled nucleotides into the growing DNA chain and foscarnet concentrations inhibiting enzymatic activity by 50% were determined. HCMV DNA polymerases were synthesised in vitro by expression of UL54 under the control of the T7 promoter. Mutations of interest were introduced into the wild-type UL54 gene by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutated polymerases and polymerases from HCMV reference strains were studied. The activity of polymerases containing mutations known to confer resistance to foscarnet (V715M, T700A and N495K) was inhibited by concentrations of foscarnet eight to 14 times higher than those required to inhibit wild-type polymerases. Our in-house non-radioactive phenotypic assay was sensitive and reproducible. It is also easy to perform and could provide a convenient method for characterising mutations conferring resistance to foscarnet in HCMV.
16014042	Cystine and glutamate transport in renal epithelial cells transfected with human system x(-) (c).	BACKGROUND: System x(-) (c) is a heterodimeric transporter, comprised of a light chain, xCT, and heavy chain, 4F2hc, which mediates the sodium-independent exchange of cystine and glutamate at the plasma membrane. In the current study we tested the hypothesis that stable transfection of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells with human xCT and 4F2hc results in the expression of functional system x(-) (c). METHODS: MDCK cells were transfected stably with human clones for xCT and 4F2hc. Analyses of time- and temperature-dependence, saturation kinetics, and substrate specificity of l-cystine and l-glutamate transport were carried out in control and xCT-4F2hc-transfected MDCK cells. We also measured the uptake of l-cystine in Xenopus oocytes expressing human xCT and/or 4F2hc or xCT and/or rBAT (a heavy chain homologous to 4F2hc). RESULTS: All of the different sets of data revealed that transport of l-cystine and l-glutamate increased significantly (twofold to threefold) in the MDCK cells subsequent to transfection with xCT-4F2hc. Moreover, uptake of l-cystine also increased (about tenfold) in Xenopus oocytes expressing hxCT and h4F2hc. Biochemical analyses of l-cystine uptake in oocytes verified our findings in the transfected MDCK cells. Interestingly, in oocytes injected with rBAT with or without xCT, uptake of l-cystine was significantly greater than that in water-injected oocytes. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that stable transfection of MDCK cells with xCT and 4F2hc results in a cell-line expressing a functional system x(-) (c) transporter that can utilize l-cystine and l-glutamate as substrates. This study apparently represents the first stable transfection of a mammalian cell line with system x(-) (c).
16897043	ABCC8 and ABCC9: ABC transporters that regulate K+ channels.	The sulfonylurea receptors (SURs) ABCC8/SUR1 and ABCC9/SUR2 are members of the C-branch of the transport adenosine triphosphatase superfamily. Unlike their brethren, the SURs have no identified transport function; instead, evolution has matched these molecules with K(+) selective pores, either K(IR)6.1/KCNJ8 or K(IR)6.2/KCNJ11, to assemble adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive K(+) channels found in endocrine cells, neurons, and both smooth and striated muscle. Adenine nucleotides, the major regulators of ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channel activity, exert a dual action. Nucleotide binding to the pore reduces the activity or channel open probability, whereas Mg-nucleotide binding and/or hydrolysis in the nucleotide-binding domains of SUR antagonize this inhibitory action to stimulate channel openings. Mutations in either subunit can alter this balance and, in the case of the SUR1/KIR6.2 channels found in neurons and insulin-secreting pancreatic beta cells, are the cause of monogenic forms of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and neonatal diabetes. Additionally, the subtle dysregulation of K(ATP) channel activity by a K(IR)6.2 polymorphism has been suggested as a predisposing factor in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Studies on K(ATP) channel null mice are clarifying the roles of these metabolically sensitive channels in a variety of tissues.
12927226	AT1 antagonism by eprosartan lowers heart rate variability and baroreflex gain.	INTRODUCTION: Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) by ACE inhibitors has been demonstrated to reduce total mortality in cardiovascular diseases. This advantage was attributed in part to changes of autonomic cardiovascular control, exemplified by an increase of heart rate variability (HRV) and baroreflex gain (BRG). We sought to assess the effects of the angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor blocker eprosartan on HRV and BRG. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a double-blind randomized cross-over design 25 young males took eprosartan (600 mg/day) and placebo each for a period of 7 days with a wash-out period of at least 4 weeks in between. At the end of the intake phases simultaneous recordings of arterial blood pressure (AP; Finapres) and electrocardiogram (ECG) were taken. Power spectra of HRV and arterial blood pressure variability (APV) were calculated by fast Fourier transform (FFT) and served to calculate BRG. Ang-II levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: Eprosartan tended to lower mean AP, it slightly increased heart rate (HR) (p<0.05), and markedly increased circulating Ang-II levels (p<0.01). Eprosartan diminished the total power of HRV (p<0.05) and the BRG (p<0.01). The low/high frequency (LF/HF) ratio of HRV and the APV were not altered. CONCLUSIONS: AT1 antagonism by eprosartan lowers heart rate variability and baroreflex gain. We speculate that these findings are due to the marked increase in circulating angiotensin II (Ang II). Further studies are needed to clarify whether angiotensin type 1 (AT1) blockers with potential actions inside the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may have different effects on HRV and BRG.
8836655	Epinastine (WAL 801CL) modulates the noncholinergic contraction in guinea-pig airways in vitro by a prejunctional 5-HT1-like receptor.	Electrical field stimulation (EFS) of guinea-pig airways, in vitro, evokes an excitatory nonadrenergic noncholinergic (eNANC) contraction mediated by release of tachykinins from sensory nerve endings. Epinastine (WAL 801CL) is an antihistaminic drug with binding affinity at certain other receptors, including alpha-adrenergic receptors and various serotonin (5-HT) receptor subtypes. It is used in asthma treatment; however, its mechanism of action remains to be fully defined. We have investigated whether epinastine could modulate the eNANC contraction in guinea-pig airways in vitro, and have tried to elucidate its receptor mechanism. Epinastine (0.1-100 microM) produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the noncholinergic contraction, with a maximum inhibition of 91 +/- 7% at 100 microM. Pretreatment of the tissues with combined 5-HT1/5-HT2 antagonists, methysergide (1 microM) or methiothepin (0.1 microM), significantly attenuated the inhibitory effect of epinastine on the noncholinergic contraction. Pretreatment with tropisetron (1 microM), a 5-HT3 antagonist, ketanserin (10 microM), a 5-HT2 antagonist, thioperamide (10 microM), a histamine H3 antagonist, or phentolamine (10 microM), an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, however, had no effect. Chlorpheniramine (10 microM), another histamine H1 receptor antagonist without significant 5-HT receptor binding affinity, did not produce any inhibition of the eNANC contraction. Epinastine (100 microM) did not displace the dose-response curve to exogenously applied substance P (0.01-10 microM). These results suggest that epinastine, although identified as a 5-HT antagonist, acts as a 5-HT1 agonist and that it inhibits the noncholinergic contraction in guinea-pig airways through stimulation of a prejunctional 5-HT1-like receptor, located to sensory nerves.
14654525	An innovative phase I clinical study demonstrates inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation by SU11248 in acute myeloid leukemia patients.	PURPOSE: Obtaining direct and rapid proof of molecular activity in early clinical trials is critical for optimal clinical development of novel targeted therapies. SU11248 is an oral multitargeted kinase inhibitor with selectivity for fms-related tyrosine kinase 3/Flk2 (FLT3), platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha/beta, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1/2, and KIT receptor tyrosine kinases. FLT3 is a promising candidate for targeted therapy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), because activating mutations occur in up to 30% of patients. We conducted an innovative single-dose clinical study with a primary objective to demonstrate inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation by SU11248 in AML. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Twenty-nine AML patients each received a single dose of SU11248, escalated from 50 to 350 mg, in increments of 50 mg and cohorts of three to six patients. FLT3 phosphorylation and plasma pharmacokinetics were evaluated at seven time points over 48 h after SU11248 administration, and FLT3 genotype was determined. Study drug-related adverse events occurred in 31% of patients, mainly grade 1 or 2 diarrhea and nausea, at higher dose levels. RESULTS: Inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation was apparent in 50% of FLT3-wild-type (WT) patients and in 100% of FLT3-mutant patients. FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutants showed increased sensitivity relative to FLT3-WT, consistent with preclinical predictions. The primary end point, strong inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation in >50% patients, was reached in 200 mg and higher dose cohorts. Downstream signaling pathways were also inhibited; signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) was reduced primarily in internal tandem duplication patients and at late time points in FLT3-WT patients, whereas extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity was reduced in the majority of patients, independent of FLT3 inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: This novel translational study bridges preclinical models to the patient setting and provides the first evidence of anti-FLT3 activity in patients. Proof of target inhibition accomplishes a crucial milestone in the development of novel oncology therapeutics.
23376407	Excessive ethanol consumption under exposure to lead intensifies disorders in bone metabolism: A study in a rat model.	It was investigated whether ethanol (Et) modifies the damaging impact of lead (Pb) on bone metabolism in a rat model reflecting excessive alcohol consumption by humans exposed to relatively high levels of this metal. For this purpose, markers of bone formation (osteocalcin, procollagen I, osteoprotegerin, alkaline phosphatase) and resorption (telopeptides of collagen I, soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand), calciotropic hormones (parathormone, calcitonin, 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) in the serum, and the femur content of mineral (including calcium - Ca and inorganic phosphorus - Pi) and organic components were estimated in the rats exposed to 500mg Pb/l (in drinking water) or/and Et (5g/kg b.wt./24h, by oral gavage) for 12weeks. Moreover, Ca and Pi in the serum and urine, alkaline phosphatase in the bone tissue and Pb in the blood and femur were determined. The exposure to Pb or/and Et decreased bone formation and increased its resorption resulting in the bone demineralization. These effects were accompanied by destroying the hormonal regulation of mineral metabolism, and Ca and Pi imbalance. The co-exposure to Pb and Et-induced disorders in bone metabolism were more advanced than those caused by Pb alone. Et co-administration increased Pb concentration in the blood and decreased its accumulation in the bone. This paper is the first report providing evidence that consumption of Et under exposure to Pb intensifies disorders in bone metabolism and that destroying of the receptor activator nuclear factor-κB (RANK)/RANK ligand/osteoprotegerin system is involved in the mechanisms of interactive action of these xenobiotics on the skeleton. The modifying impact of Et may be an effect of its independent osteotropic action and interaction with Pb. Based on the results it can be concluded that alcohol abuse by subjects excessively exposed to Pb considerably increases the risk of bone damage.
9643444	Investigation into the presence of insulin-degrading enzyme in cultured type II alveolar cells and the effects of enzyme inhibitors on pulmonary bioavailability of insulin in rats.	The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE, EC 3.4.22.11) in insulin degradation in alveolar epithelium. The primary culture of isolated rat type-II pneumocytes was used for the in-vitro characterization of IDE. Insulin was then administered intratracheally with various inhibitors to assess the improvement in its pulmonary bioavailability. In cultured type-II pneumocytes, the cytosolic insulin-degrading activity contributed 81% of total insulin degradation, reached a maximum at pH 7.5 and had an apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) of 135 nM. N-Ethylmaleimide, p-chloromercuribenzoic acid and 1,10-phenanthroline inhibited insulin-degrading activity almost completely in both crude homogenate and cytosol. An immunoprecipitation study showed that IDE contributed 74% of cytosolic insulin-degrading activity. Western blot analysis showing a single band of 110 kDa on reduced SDS (sodium dodecylsulphate) gels confirmed the presence of IDE in cultured type-II cells. When given intratracheally with insulin, inhibitors including N-ethylmaleimide, p-chloromercuribenzoic acid, and 1,10-phenanthroline significantly enhanced the absolute bioavailability of insulin and the compound's hypoglycaemic effects. These results suggest that IDE is present in alveolar epithelium and might be involved in limiting insulin absorption in the lung.
17652426	Bone growth retardation in mouse embryos expressing human collagenase 1.	Cellular growth and differentiation are readouts of multiple signaling pathways from the intercellular and/or extracellular milieu. The extracellular matrix through the activation of cellular receptors transmits these signals. Therefore, extracellular matrix proteolysis could affect cell fate in a variety of biological events. However, the biological consequence of inadequate extracellular matrix degradation in vivo is not clear. We developed a mouse model expressing human collagenase (matrix metalloproteinase-1, MMP-1) under the control of Col2a1 promoter. The mice showed significant growth retardation during embryogenesis and a loss of the demarcation of zonal structure and columnar array of the cartilage. Immunological examination revealed increased degradation of type II collagen and upregulation of fibronectin and alpha(5)-integrin subunit in the transgenic cartilage. The resting zone and proliferating zone of the growth plate cartilage exhibited a simultaneous increase in bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-incorporated proliferating cells and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated X-dUTP nick-end labeling-positive apoptotic cells, respectively. Chondrocyte differentiation was not disturbed in the transgenic mice as evidenced by normal expression of the Ihh and type X collagen expression. These data demonstrate that type II collagen proteolysis is an important determinant for the skeletal outgrowth through modulation of chondrocyte survival and cartilagenous growth.
15700891	Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of exenatide in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.	PURPOSE: The pharmacology and tolerability of exenatide in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were studied. METHODS: Two randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled studies were conducted. Treatment with oral antidiabetic agents was stopped 14 days before study initiation. In the first study (study A), eight subjects received placebo, 0.1-, 0.2-, 0.3-, and either 0.4-microg/kg exenatide or placebo five minutes before a meal combined with liquid acetaminophen (to assess the rate of gastric emptying) on days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. In the second study (study B), subjects received a single s.c. dose of exenatide or placebo on consecutive days. Part 1 of study B used exenatide doses of 0.01 and 0.1 microg/ kg; 0.02-, 0.05-, and 0.1-microg/kg doses were given in part 2. After an overnight fast, the study drug was injected 15 minutes before a meal (part 1) and before a meal and acetaminophen (part 2). Parts 1 and 2 of study B enrolled six and eight patients, respectively. RESULTS: In both studies, plasma exenatide pharmacokinetic profiles appeared dose proportional. Exenatide doses of 0.02-0.2 microg/kg dose-dependently lowered postprandial glucose excursions. Exenatide suppressed postprandial plasma glucagon and slowed gastric emptying. There were no serious adverse events and no patient withdrawals related to treatment. Nausea and vomiting were the most common adverse events and were mild to moderate in severity at doses ranging from 0.02 to 0.2 microg/kg. CONCLUSION: Administration of preprandial exenatide by s.c. injection resulted in dose-proportional exenatide pharmacokinetics and antidiabetic pharmacodynamic activity. At doses ranging from 0.02 to 0.2 microg/kg, exenatide dose-dependently reduced postprandial plasma glucose excursion by insulinotropism, suppression of plasma glucagon, and slowing of gastric emptying.
23601990	Synthesis and biological evaluation of phosphorylated flavonoids as potent and selective inhibitors of cholesterol esterase.	A series of phosphorylated flavonoids were synthesized and investigated in vitro as inhibitors of pancreatic cholesterol esterase (CEase) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The results showed that most of the synthesized compounds exhibited nanomolar potency against CEase, much better than the parent flavonoids. Furthermore, these phosphorylated flavonoids demonstrated good to high selectivity for CEase over AChE, which only showed micromolar potency inhibition of AChE. The most selective and potent inhibitor of CEase (3e) had IC50 value of 0.72 nM and 11800-fold selectivity for CEase over AChE. The structure-activity relationships revealed that the free hydroxyl group at position 5 and phosphate group at position 7 of the phosphorylated flavonoids are favorable to the inhibition of CEase. The inhibition mechanism and kinetic characterization studies indicated that they are irreversible competitive inhibitors of CEase.
14711372	Structural model of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I based on the carnitine acetyltransferase crystal.	CPT I (carnitine palmitoyltransferase I) catalyses the conversion of palmitoyl-CoA into palmitoylcarnitine in the presence of L-carnitine, facilitating the entry of fatty acids into mitochondria. We propose a 3-D (three-dimensional) structural model for L-CPT I (liver CPT I), based on the similarity of this enzyme to the recently crystallized mouse carnitine acetyltransferase. The model includes 607 of the 773 amino acids of L-CPT I, and the positions of carnitine, CoA and the palmitoyl group were assigned by superposition and docking analysis. Functional analysis of this 3-D model included the mutagenesis of several amino acids in order to identify putative catalytic residues. Mutants D477A, D567A and E590D showed reduced L-CPT I activity. In addition, individual mutation of amino acids forming the conserved Ser685-Thr686-Ser687 motif abolished enzyme activity in mutants T686A and S687A and altered K(m) and the catalytic efficiency for carnitine in mutant S685A. We conclude that the catalytic residues are His473 and Asp477, while Ser687 probably stabilizes the transition state. Several conserved lysines, i.e. Lys455, Lys505, Lys560 and Lys561, were also mutated. Only mutants K455A and K560A showed decreases in activity of 50%. The model rationalizes the finding of nine natural mutations in patients with hereditary L-CPT I deficiencies.
22867529	Synthesis, characterization, screening and docking analysis of 4-anilinoquinazoline derivatives as tyrosine kinase inhibitors.	We report here the design and synthesis of a series of 4-anilinoquinazoline derivatives, of which 7 compounds were crystallographically characterized, as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors by modifications on the aniline ring or at the 6-alkoxy site of the 6,7-dimethoxy-4-anilinoquinazoline pharmacophore. The relative inhibition efficiency on EGFR of all as-prepared compounds were measured and ordered, and the IC50 values of nine highly active compounds were determined by ELISA. Docking studies indicated that all 4-anilinoquinazoline derivatives could be inserted into the ATP-binding pocket of the EGFR via indirect docking, and that the modifications at the 3'-position of the anilino group and 6-alkoxy site of the quinazoline ring have little interference with the formation of the two essential H-bonds between the N3 of the quinazoline ring and Thr766 through a water molecule, and the N1 of the quinazoline ring and N-H of Met769. The displacing of the phenyl at 4-position with pyridinyl dramatically reduces the activity of the quinazoline pharmacophore, the resulting derivative (10) being the least active compound. The docking results also showed that the formation of new H-bonds between the N-H of the ethylenediamine group linked to the 6-alkoxy site and Asp776/Cys773 in the binding pocket of EGFR makes compounds 19 (IC50=12.1±1.6 nM) and 20 (IC50=13.6±0.8 nM) the most potent EGFR inhibitors in this class and worthy of further modification to obtain more potent anticancer compounds.
10901669	Effects of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin or 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl on vitamin K-dependent blood coagulation in male and female WAG/Rij-rats.	Newborns are susceptible to hemorrhages (hemorrhagic disease of the newborn or HDN) due to vitamin K deficiency. Induction of cytochrome P450 in the fetal liver by maternal anticonvulsant therapy such as phenobarbital or phenytoin is considered to be a major cause. An observed increase in late hemorrhagic disease (LHD) in breast fed neonates gave rise to the hypothesis that PCBs and dioxins, P450-inducing contaminants present in human milk, might effect vitamin K-dependent blood coagulation. This hypothesis was studied in rats. Administration of a single oral dose of 0.003, 0.03, 0.3, 3 or 30 nmol 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) per kg bodyweight or 0.75, 4, 20, 100 or 500 micromol 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl/kg bw (HxCB) to female and male rats resulted in dose-related reductions of the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor VII. The highest factor VII reduction in female rats was 44%, observed after TCDD exposure. The Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Level (LOAEL) of TCDD on female factor VII levels was 0.3 nmol/kg bw (96 ng/kg). There was a significant inverse correlation between Factor VII levels and induction of hepatic ethoxyresorufin O-deethylating (EROD) activity, reflecting CYP1A1, and total P450 content. HxCB had no effect on female coagulation factors. In contrast, in male rats only exposure to HxCB, which induces mainly CYP2B1 and 2B2, decreased both coagulation factors dramatically up to 88%. The LOAEL of HxCB on factor VII in male rats was 100 micromol/kg bw (36 mg/kg). In general, effects on coagulation factors in male rats exceeded those in females. In addition, sex-dependent differences of TCDD and HxCB were observed on the hepatic vitamin K cycle enzyme activities in female and male rats. Vitamin K-dependent (gamma-glutamyl carboxylase activity was mainly induced in female rats; 2.3-fold in the highest dose group of TCDD. In male rats only vitamin K 2,3-epoxide reductase (KO-reductase) activity was induced 1.7-fold by the highest dose of HxCB. KO-reductase activity in female rats was also increased by TCDD, however, less pronounced than the carboxylase activity. Concluding, the hepatic vitamin K cycle still functions and is not blocked by TCDD or HxCB, thus explaining the observed reduction in factor VII. Finally, the possible role of P450 in vitamin K deficiency is discussed. Based on these results it is suggested to investigate the possible role of PCBs and dioxin-like compounds in LHD in more detail.
23576111	Protective effects of green tea on antioxidative biomarkers in chemical laboratory workers.	Chemical materials are environmental contaminants, are extensively used in laboratories, and may cause various forms of health hazards in laboratory workers. Therefore, this toxicity most likely is a result of the oxidative metabolism of chemical to reactive products. As green tea (GT) possesses antioxidant effects, the objective of this study was to examine any amelioration oxidative stress in chemical laboratory workers drinking one cup (3 g/300 ml water) of freshly prepared tea once daily. Baseline characteristics including age, sex, smoking, fruit consumption, and duration of exposure were recorded via questionnaire to the subjects. Saliva level oxidative stress parameters such as total antioxidant capacity (TAC), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were estimated before and after consumption of GT in these workers. Treatment of subjects with GT induced a significant reduction in saliva GPx activity (406.61 ± 22.07 vs. 238.96 ± 16.26 U/l p = 0.001) and induction in TAC (0.46 ± 0.029 μmol/ml vs. 0.56 ± 0.031, p = 0.016). No statistically significant alteration was found for saliva SOD (0.080 ± 0.0019 vs. 0.079 ± 0.0014, p > 0.05) and CAT (20.36 ± 0.69 vs. 19.78 ± 0.71, p > 0.05) after 28 days treatment by GT. These results demonstrate that drinking GT during chemical exposure can reduce several parameters indicative of oxidative stress. In conclusion, using GT as a dietary supplement can be a rational protocol to control source of hazards in chemical laboratory workers.
9480923	Exogenous C2-ceramide activates c-fos serum response element via Rac-dependent signalling pathway.	Ceramide is an important regulatory molecule implicated in a variety of biological processes in response to stress and cytokines. To understand the signal transduction pathway of ceramide to the nucleus, in the present study, we examined whether C2-ceramide, a cell permeable ceramide, activates c-fos serum response element (SRE). Treatment of Rat-2 fibroblast cells with C2-ceramide caused the stimulation of c-fos SRE-dependent reporter gene activity in a dose- and time-dependent manner by transient transfection analysis. Next, we examined the role of Rho family GTPases in the ceramide-induced signalling to SRE activation. By reporter gene analysis following transient transfections with various plasmids expressing a dominant negative mutant form of Cdc42, Rac1 or RhoA, C2-ceramide-induced SRE activation was shown to be selectively repressed by pEXV-RacN17 encoding a dominant negative mutant of Rac1, suggesting that Rac activity is essential for the signalling cascade of ceramide to the nucleus. In a further study to analyse the downstream mediator of Rac in the ceramide-signalling pathway, we observed that either pretreatment with mepacrine, a potent and specific inhibitor of phospholipase A2, or co-transfection with antisense cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) oligonucleotide repressed the C2-ceramide-induced SRE activation selectively, implying a critical role of cPLA2 in C2-ceramide-induced signalling to nucleus. Consistent with these results, the translocation of cPLA2 protein as well as the release of arachidonic acid, a principal product of phospholipase A2, was rapidly induced by the addition of C2-ceramide in a Rac-dependent manner. Together, our findings suggest the critical role of 'Rac and subsequent activation of phospholipase A2' in ceramide-signalling to nucleus.
12488248	Organic anion transporter 3 (Slc22a8) is a dicarboxylate exchanger indirectly coupled to the Na+ gradient.	Basolateral uptake of organic anions in renal proximal tubule cells is indirectly coupled to the Na(+) gradient through Na(+)-dicarboxylate cotransport and organic anion/dicarboxylate exchange. One member of the organic anion transporter (OAT) family, Oat1, is expressed in the proximal tubule and is an organic anion/dicarboxylate exchanger. However, a second organic anion carrier, Oat3, is also highly expressed in the renal proximal tubule, but its mechanism is unclear. Thus we have assessed Oat3 function in Xenopus laevis oocytes and rat renal cortical slices. Probenecid-sensitive uptake of p-aminohippurate (PAH, an Oat1 and Oat3 substrate) and estrone sulfate (ES, an Oat3 substrate) in rat Oat3-expressing oocytes was significantly trans-stimulated by preloading the oocytes with the dicarboxylate glutarate (GA). GA stimulation of ES transport by oocytes coexpressing rabbit Na(+)-dicarboxylate cotransporter 1 and rat Oat3 was significantly inhibited when the preloading medium contained Li(+) or methylsuccinate (MS) or when Na(+) was absent. All these treatments inhibit the Na(+)-dicarboxylate cotransporter, but not rat Oat3. Li(+), MS, and Na(+) removal had no effect when applied during the ES uptake step, rather than during the GA preloading step. Concentrative ES uptake in rat renal cortical slices was also demonstrated to be probenecid and Na(+) sensitive. Accumulation of ES was stimulated by GA, and this stimulation was completely blocked by probenecid, Li(+), MS, taurocholate, and removal of Na(+). Thus Oat3 functions as an organic anion/dicarboxylate exchanger that couples organic anion uptake indirectly to the Na(+) gradient.
12023506	Interaction of human organic anion transporters 2 and 4 with organic anion transport inhibitors.	The organic anion transport system is involved in the tubular excretion and reabsorption of various drugs and substances. The purpose of this study was to characterize the effects of various organic anion transport inhibitors on renal organic anion transport using proximal tubule cells stably expressing human organic anion transporter 2 (hOAT2) and hOAT4. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that hOAT2 is localized to the basolateral side of the proximal tubule in the kidney. hOAT2 mediated a time- and concentration-dependent increase in prostaglandin F(2alpha) (PGF(2alpha)) uptake. The organic anion transport inhibitors used for this study were probenecid, 8-(noradamantan-3-yl)-1,3-dipropylxanthine (KW-3902), betamipron, and cilastatin. Probenecid, but not KW-3902, betamipron, and cilastatin, significantly inhibited hOAT2-mediated PGF(2alpha) uptake. In contrast, probenecid, KW-3902, and betamipron, but not cilastatin, inhibited hOAT4-mediated estrone sulfate (ES) uptake. Kinetic analyses revealed that these inhibitions were competitive. The K(i) value of probenecid for hOAT2 was 766 microM, whereas those of probenecid, KW-3902, and betamipron for hOAT4 were 54.9, 20.7, and 502 microM, respectively. These results suggest that probenecid, KW-3902, and betamipron could inhibit hOAT4-mediated ES uptake in vitro, whereas probenecid alone could inhibit the hOAT2-mediated PGF(2alpha) uptake. Comparing the K(i) values with the therapeutically relevant concentrations of unbound inhibitors in the plasma, probenecid alone was predicted to inhibit hOAT4-mediated organic anion transport in vivo.
23494481	Neuroprotection against neuroblastoma cell death induced by depletion of mitochondrial glutathione.	Mitochondrial glutathione pool is vital in protecting cells against oxidative stress as the majority of the cellular reactive oxygen species are generated in mitochondria. Oxidative stress is implicated as a causative factor in neuronal death in neurodegenerative disorders. We hypothesized that depletion of mitochondrial glutathione leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptotic death of SK-N-SH (human neuroblastoma) cells and investigated the neuroprotective strategies against GSH depletion. SK-N-SH cells were treated with two distinct inhibitors of glutathione metabolism: L-buthionine-(S, R)-sulfoximine (BSO) and ethacrynic acid (EA). EA treatment caused depletion of both the total and mitochondrial glutathione (while BSO had no effect on mitochondrial glutathione), enhanced rotenone-induced ROS production, and reduced the viability of SK-N-SH cells. Glutathione depletion by BSO or EA demonstrated positive features of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in neuroblastoma cell death. Prevention of apoptosis by Bcl2 overexpression or use of antioxidant ebselen did not confer neuroprotection. Co-culture with U-87 (human glioblastoma) cells protected SK-N-SH cells from the cell death. Our data suggest that depletion of mitochondrial glutathione leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. The study indicates that preventing mitochondrial glutathione depletion could become a novel strategy for the development of neuroprotective therapeutics in neurodegenerative disorders.
19498041	Exploring the mechanism of agonist efficacy: a relationship between efficacy and agonist dissociation rate at the muscarinic M3 receptor.	Although there are several empirical approaches that enable the comparison of relative agonist efficacy, the molecular basis that underlies differences in the ability of G protein-coupled receptor agonists to elicit a response is still largely unexplained. Several models have been described that incorporate the kinetics of receptor-mediated initiation of the G protein cycle, but these have not directly addressed the influence of agonist-binding kinetics. To test this, we investigated the relationship between the efficacy of seven M(3) muscarinic receptor agonists and their rate of dissociation (k(off)) from the M(3) receptor. The association and dissociation rate constants of the agonists were determined using a l-[N-methyl]-[(3)H]scopolamine methyl chloride competition binding assay in the presence of GTP. The agonists displayed a range of association and dissociation rates. Relative agonist efficacy was measured at two points after M(3) receptor activation: the stimulation of guanosine 5'-O-(3-[(35)S]thio)triphosphate binding to G alpha subunits, and the subsequent increase in intracellular calcium levels. These experiments revealed a range of intrinsic efficacy, from the low-efficacy pilocarpine and oxotremorine to high-efficacy acetylcholine. There was no relationship between agonist efficacy and the equilibrium binding affinity of each agonist (K(d)). When efficacy was compared with the dissociation rate constant, however, the two were highly correlated, suggesting a relationship between the duration of agonist binding at the receptor and the intrinsic efficacy. These data suggest that kinetic models incorporating the mean lifetime of specific complexes will be required to fully explain the nature of agonist efficacy.
16929463	Effects of vitamin K1 supplementation on vascular responsiveness and oxidative stress in a rat femoral osteotomy model.	The main function of vitamin K1 is to act a co-factor for gamma-glutamyl carboxylase. However, it has also been shown to lessen oxidative stress. This study was aimed to evaluate the effect of vitamin K1 supplementation on vascular responsiveness and oxidative status in rats that underwent femoral osteotomy. Twenty-four male rats were divided into three groups to serve as sham, osteotomy and vitamin K1 groups. Indices of oxidative stress (catalase), and oxidative damage (malondialdehyde) were analysed in erythrocytes. In order to evaluate vascular reactivity, concentration-response curves to phenylephrine, angiotensin II, 5-hydroxytryptamine, bradykinin and histamine were constructed. The findings of this study clearly show that oxidative stress clearly increases after femoral osteotomy in rats. Also, this operation causes a significant depression in vascular responsiveness to contracting agents and endothelium-dependent vasodilators. However, vitamin K1 supplementation prevents vascular hyporeactivity by reducing oxidative stress and may represent a novel approach during osteotomy healing.
23282998	Characterization of arsenic induced cytotoxicity in liver with stress in erythrocytes and its reversibility with Pleurotus florida lectin.	Arsenic is one of the most hazardous substances in the environment known to cause toxicity in multiple organs. Cell adhesion, morphological alterations, cell proliferation, terminal deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) and caspase-3/CPP32 fluorometric protease assay were important biomarkers to assess apoptosis in cells. This study aimed to evaluate arsenic-induced apoptosis in the hepatocytes of rat and its protective efficacy with coadministration of ascorbic acid (AA) and Pleurotus florida lectin (PFL) individually. Results of the present study also showed that arsenic caused cytotoxicity by elevating morphological alterations, TUNEL-positive nuclei, caspase-3 activity and DNA damage and reducing cell adhesion and cell proliferation in a time-dependent manner. The apoptosis in hepatocytes was reverted to normal value after coadministration of mushroom lectin in arsenic-exposed rat. The study provided significant evidence that PFL has antiapoptotic property against arsenic-induced toxicity. The beneficial effect of PFL was proportional to its duration of exposure. Retard activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase, enhanced lipid peroxidation as well as protein carbonyl in erythrocytes caused by arsenic could also be maintained toward normalcy by supplementation of AA and PFL. These antioxidative effects were exhibited in a time-dependant manner. In rat, treatment with AA and PFL prevented alteration of plasma enzyme activities caused by arsenic. The results concluded that treatment with PFL has significant role in protecting animals from arsenic-induced erythrocytic damage. This finding might be of therapeutic benefit in people suffering from chronic exposure to arsenic from natural sources, a global problem especially relevant to millions of people on the Indian subcontinent.
16905533	Phosphorylation and up-regulation of diacylglycerol kinase gamma via its interaction with protein kinase C gamma.	Diacylglycerol (DAG) acts as an allosteric activator of protein kinase C (PKC) and is converted to phosphatidic acid by DAG kinase (DGK). Therefore, DGK is thought to be a negative regulator of PKC activation. Here we show molecular mechanisms of functional coupling of the two kinases. gammaPKC directly associated with DGKgamma through its accessory domain (AD), depending on Ca2+ as well as phosphatidylserine/diolein in vitro. Mass spectrometric analysis and mutation studies revealed that gammaPKC phosphorylated Ser-776 and Ser-779 in the AD of DGKgamma. The phosphorylation by gammaPKC resulted in activation of DGKgamma because a DGKgamma mutant in which Ser-776 and Ser-779 were substituted with glutamic acid to mimic phosphorylation exhibited significantly higher activity compared with wild type DGKgamma and an unphosphorylatable DGKgamma mutant. Importantly, the interaction of the two kinases and the phosphorylation of DGKgamma by gammaPKC could be confirmed in vivo, and overexpression of the AD of DGKgamma inhibited re-translocation of gammaPKC. These results demonstrate that localization and activation of the functionally correlated kinases, gammaPKC and DGKgamma, are spatio-temporally orchestrated by their direct association and phosphorylation, contributing to subtype-specific regulation of DGKgamma and DAG signaling.
23536519	Resveratrol inhibits proliferation, angiogenesis and induces apoptosis in colon cancer cells: Calorie restriction is the force to the cytotoxicity.	The aim of this study was to examine the antitumour activity of resveratrol in human colorectal cancer cell lines (HCT116 and Caco2) and to explore its mechanism of action assuming that it is by calorie-restriction effect. Resveratrol inhibited the proliferation of colon cancer cells with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) equal to 50 and 130 μM for HCT116 and Caco2, respectively. Caco2 cells appeared with significant time-dependent increase in the glycolytic pathway, a behaviour that was absent in HCT116 cells. Resveratrol (100 μM) significantly decreased the glycolytic enzymes (pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase) in Caco2 cells, while an increase in citrate synthase activity and a decrease in glucose consumption were observed in both cell lines. Moreover, resveratrol downregulated the expressions of leptin and c-Myc, and decreased the content of vascular endothelial growth factor. The apoptotic markers, caspases 3 and 8, were activated and the Bax/BCl2 ratio was increased. The study suggested a promising anticancer activity of resveratrol, calorie-restriction pathway may be one of the driving forces for this activity.
23566269	4-Hydroxypyridazin-3(2H)-one Derivatives as Novel d-Amino Acid Oxidase Inhibitors.	d-Amino acid oxidase (DAAO) catalyzes the oxidation of d-amino acids including d-serine, a coagonist of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor. We identified a series of 4-hydroxypyridazin-3(2H)-one derivatives as novel DAAO inhibitors with high potency and substantial cell permeability using fragment-based drug design. Comparisons of complex structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank as well as those determined with in-house fragment hits revealed that a hydrophobic subpocket was formed perpendicular to the flavin ring by flipping Tyr224 in a ligand-dependent manner. We investigated the ability of the initial fragment hit, 3-hydroxy-pyridine-2(1H)-one, to fill this subpocket with the aid of complex structure information. 3-Hydroxy-5-(2-phenylethyl)pyridine-2(1H)-one exhibited the predicted binding mode and demonstrated high inhibitory activity for human DAAO in enzyme- and cell-based assays. We further designed and synthesized 4-hydroxypyridazin-3(2H)-one derivatives, which are equivalent to the 3-hydroxy-pyridine-2(1H)-one series but lack cell toxicity. 6-[2-(3,5-Difluorophenyl)ethyl]-4-hydroxypyridazin-3(2H)-one was found to be effective against MK-801-induced cognitive deficit in the Y-maze.
17565005	The impact of hypoxic treatment on the expression of phosphoglycerate kinase and the cytotoxicity of troxacitabine and gemcitabine.	beta-L-Dioxolane-cytidine (L-OddC, Troxacitabine, BCH-4556), a novel L-configuration deoxycytidine analog, is under clinical trials for treating cancer. The cytotoxicity of L-OddC is dependent on the amount of the triphosphate form (L-OddCTP) in nuclear DNA. Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), a downstream protein of hypoxia-inducible-factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), is responsible for the phosphorylation of the diphosphate to the triphosphate of L-OddC. In this study, we studied the impact of hypoxia on the metabolism and the cytotoxicity of L-OddC and beta-d-2',2'-difluorodeoxycytidine (dFdC) in several human tumor cell lines including HepG2, Hep3B, A673, Panc-1, and RKO. Hypoxic treatment induced the protein expression of PGK 3-fold but had no effect on the protein expression of APE-1, dCK, CMPK, and nM23 H1. Hypoxic treatment increased L-OddCTP formation and incorporation of L-OddC into DNA, but it decreased the uptake and incorporation of dFdC, which correlated with the reduction of hENT1, hENT2, and hCNT2 expression. Using a clonogenic assay, hypoxic treatment of cells made them 2- to 3-fold more susceptible to L-OddC but not to dFdC after exposure to drugs for one generation. Dimethyloxallyl glycine enhanced the cytotoxicity of L-OddC but not dFdC in Panc-1 cells under normoxic conditions. Overexpression or down-regulation of PGK using transient transfection of pcDNA5-PGK or inducible shRNA in RKO cells affected the cytotoxicity of L-OddC but not that of dFdC. The knockdown of HIF-1alpha in inducible shRNA in RKO cells reduced the cytotoxicity of L-OddC but not dFdC under hypoxic conditions. In conclusion, hypoxia is an important factor that may potentiate the activity of L-OddC.
23643730	Juglone, isolated from Juglans mandshurica Maxim, induces apoptosis via down-regulation of AR expression in human prostate cancer LNCaP cells.	Juglone is a natural compound which has been isolated from Juglans mandshurica Maxim. Recent studies have shown that juglone had various pharmacological effects such as anti-viral, anti-bacterial and anti-cancer. However, its anti-cancer activity on human prostate cancer LNCaP cell has not been examined. Thus, the current study was designed to elucidate the molecular mechanism of apoptosis induced by juglone in androgen-sensitive prostate cancer LNCaP cells. MTT assay was performed to examine the anti-proliferative effect of juglone. Occurrence of apoptosis was detected by Hoechst 33342 staining and flow cytometry in LNCaP cells treated with juglone for 24h. The result shown that juglone inhibited the growth of LNCaP cells in a dose-dependent manner. Morphological changes of apoptotic body formation after juglone treatment were observed by Hoechst 33342 staining. This apoptotic induction was associated with loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and caspase-3, -9 activation. Moreover, we found that juglone significantly inhibited the expression levels of androgen receptor (AR) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in a dose-dependent manner, as well as abrogated up-regulation of AR and PSA genes with and/or without dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Take together, our results demonstrated that juglone might induce the apoptosis in LNCaP cell via down-regulation of AR expression. Therefore, our results indicated that juglone may be a potential candidate of drug for androgen-sensitive prostate cancer.
7853212	Mepyramine, a histamine H1 receptor antagonist, inhibits the metabolic activity of rat and human P450 2D forms.	The interaction of antihistaminics, including mepyramine, with rat hepatic cytochrome P450s (P450s) was investigated. We first investigated mepyramine binding to eight forms of rat hepatic P450s. Mepyramine bound specifically to P450 2D1, which suggests that it inhibits P450 2D activity. Histamine H1 receptor antagonists (mepyramine, diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine and triprolidine) inhibited the lidocaine 3-hydroxylation activity catalyzed by P450 2D1 but did not inhibit the testosterone hydroxylation activities catalyzed by P450s other than P450 2D forms. The Ki values of these antagonists for the catalytic activity of P450 2D1 were low and were similar to those of quinine and quinidine, which are specific inhibitors of P450 2D forms. The Ki value of mepyramine was especially low, at 34 nM. Furthermore, the effects of mepyramine on human P450 2D6 were investigated. Among the ten forms of human P450 expressed in yeast, mepyramine bound specifically to P450 2D6 in a binding assay. In human hepatic microsomes, mepyramine inhibited the debrisoquine 4-hydroxylation activity catalyzed by P450 2D6. These results indicate that histamine H1 receptor antagonists such as mepyramine are potent inhibitors of P450 2D forms because of their high affinity for these enzymes.
23142558	The 17-β-oestradiol inhibits osteoclast activity by increasing the cannabinoid CB2 receptor expression.	Bone is a highly metabolically active tissue and its formation and resorption is at the base of bone remodelling. The critical importance of a balanced bone remodelling is demonstrated by human diseases, i.e. osteoporosis, in which a net increase in bone resorption is responsible of skeleton weakening and fracture risk. Oestrogens display anti-resorptive properties on bone metabolism. Indeed, the so-called post-menopausal osteoporosis occurs after interruption of gonad function and benefits from hormonal replacement treatment. Recently, an important role for the endocannabinoid system in the regulation of skeletal remodelling in human has also been shown. In particular, we showed that CB2 stimulation is able to reduce the number of human OCs in vitro. Here, we provide unprecedented evidence that 17-β-oestradiol administration inhibits activity and formation of human OCs in vitro, demonstrating that oestrogens are able to induce an increase of CB2 expression probably through the recruitment of a putative oestrogens responsive element in the CB2 encoding for gene.
23220413	Exposure of zebrafish embryos/larvae to TDCPP alters concentrations of thyroid hormones and transcriptions of genes involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis.	Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCPP) has been frequently detected in the environment and in various biota, including fish, and has been implicated in disruption of the thyroid endocrine system. In the present study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed to different concentrations of TDCPP (10, 50, 100, 300 and 600 μg/L) from 2 h post-fertilization (hpf) to 144 hpf. Developmental endpoints, and whole-body concentrations of thyroid hormones and transcriptional profiles of genes involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis were examined. Exposure to TDCPP caused a dose-dependent developmental toxicity, including decreased body weight, reduced hatching, survival and heartbeat rates, and increased malformation (spinal curvature). Treatment with the positive control chemical 3,3',5-triiodo-l-thyronine (T3) significantly decreased whole-body thyroxin (T4) concentrations, increased whole-body T3 concentrations, and upregulated mRNA expression involved in the HPT axis as a compensatory mechanism. These results suggested that the HPT axis in 144-hpf zebrafish larvae was responsive to chemical exposure and could be used to evaluate the effects of chemicals on the thyroid endocrine system. TDCPP exposure significantly decreased whole-body T4 concentrations and increased whole-body T3 concentrations, indicating thyroid endocrine disruption. The upregulation of genes related to thyroid hormone metabolism (dio1 and ugt1ab) might be responsible for decreased T4 concentrations. Treatment with TDCPP also significantly increased transcription of genes involved in thyroid hormone synthesis (tshβ, slc5a5 and tg) and thyroid development (hhex, nkx2.1 and pax8) as a compensatory mechanism for decreased T4 concentrations. Taken together, these results suggest that TDCPP alters the transcription of genes involved in the HPT axis and changes whole-body concentrations of thyroid hormones in zebrafish embryos/larvae, thus causing an endocrine disruption of the thyroid system.
16223973	SOM230 inhibits insulin-like growth factor-I action in mammary gland development by pituitary independent mechanism: mediated through somatostatin subtype receptor 3?	Somatostatin analogs (SAs) treat acromegaly by lowering pituitary GH secretion, which, in turn, lowers systemic IGF-I. The profound systemic effect is often greater than expected in the face of only partial GH suppression. Here we report that the SA SOM230 can also act by a nonpituitary-mediated inhibition of IGF-I action. SOM230 inhibited mammary development in intact and hypophysectomized female rats, a process requiring IGF-I. IGF-I overcame this inhibition. SOM230 also inhibited other actions of IGF-I (inhibition of apoptosis, phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1, and cell division). SOM230 did not reduce IGF-I mRNA abundance in mammary gland but did stimulate IGF binding protein 5 (IGFBP5). IGFBP5 was 3.75 times higher in mammary epithelium of SOM230 than in placebo animals (P < 0.001). Administration of IGFBP-5 also inhibited GH-induced mammary development (P < 0.001). Measurement of sstr(1-5) (somatostatin subtype receptor) by real-time RT-PCR revealed that the mammary glands had an abundance of sstr(3) and lower amounts of sstr(4) and sstr(5) but no sstr(1) or sstr(2.) That mammary development was also inhibited to a lesser degree than SOM230 by octreotide, whose main action is through sstr(2), strongly suggests that sstr(3) is at least in part mediating the effects of the SAs. We conclude that 1) SAs inhibit IGF-I action in the mammary gland through a novel nonpituitary mechanism; 2) IGFBP-5, here shown to inhibit pubertal mammary development, might mediate the effect; and 3) Measurement of available sstr receptors in the mammary gland suggests that sstr(3) mediates the SA activity, but sstr(5) is also a possible mediator.
2653642	Cysteamine and the endocrine pancreas: immunocytochemical, immunochemical, and functional aspects.	To evaluate the previously reported depletion of pancreatic somatostatin by cysteamine (beta-mercaptoethylamine), mice were injected subcutaneously with the drug at 300 mg/kg. Immunocytochemical analysis performed on sections from tissue taken at 4 h after the injection revealed an elimination of somatostatin-14-like immunoreactivity without alterations in the somatostatin-28(1-12)-like immunoreactivity. In sections from tissues taken at 24 h after injection, no differences between cysteamine-injected animals and controls were observed. Immunochemical analysis of somatostatin-14-like immunoreactivity in pancreatic extracts showed a significant reduction of the concentration (P less than 0.001). In contrast, no change in the insulin concentration was observed. Functionally, cysteamine lowered the plasma glucose levels at 1 h after injection; this effect persisted for 6 h. Plasma insulin levels were likewise reduced transiently by cysteamine. Concomitant administration of somatostatin did not influence these effects of cysteamine. The plasma glucose-lowering effect of cysteamine was seen also in alloxan-diabetic mice. We conclude that cysteamine alters the immunoreactive characteristics of pancreatic somatostatin without affecting the immunoreactivity of insulin, and that cysteamine transiently reduces plasma glucose and insulin levels.
12721093	Crosstalk between presynaptic angiotensin receptors, bradykinin receptors and alpha 2-autoreceptors in sympathetic neurons: a study in alpha 2-adrenoceptor-deficient mice.	1. In mouse atria, angiotensin II and bradykinin lose much or all of their noradrenaline release-enhancing effect when presynaptic alpha(2)-autoinhibition does not operate either because of stimulation with very brief pulse trains or because of treatment with alpha(2) antagonists. We now studied this operational condition in alpha(2)-adrenoceptor-deficient mice. Release of (3)H-noradrenaline was elicited by electrical stimulation. 2. In tissues from wild-type (WT) mice, angiotensin II and bradykinin increased the overflow of tritium evoked by 120 pulses at 3 Hz. This enhancement did not occur or was much reduced when tissues were stimulated by 120 pulses at 3 Hz in the presence of rauwolscine and phentolamine, or when they were stimulated by 20 pulses at 50 Hz. 3. In tissues from mice lacking the alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor (alpha(2A)KO) or the alpha(2B)-adrenoceptor (alpha(2B)KO), the concentration-response curves of angiotensin II and bradykinin (120 pulses at 3 Hz) were unchanged. In tissues from mice lacking the alpha(2C)-adrenoceptor (alpha(2C)KO) or both the alpha(2A)- and the alpha(2C)-adrenoceptor (alpha(2AC)KO), the concentration-response curves were shifted to the same extent downwards. 4. As in WT tissues, angiotensin II and bradykinin lost most or all of their effect in alpha(2A)KO and alpha(2AC)KO tissues when rauwolscine and phentolamine were present or trains consisted of 20 pulses at 50 Hz. 5. Rauwolscine and phentolamine increased tritium overflow evoked by 120 pulses at 3 Hz up to seven-fold in WT and alpha(2B)KO tissues, three-fold in alpha(2A)KO and alpha(2C)KO tissues, and two-fold in alpha(2AC)KO tissues. 6. Results confirm that angiotensin II and bradykinin require ongoing alpha(2)-autoinhibition for the full extent of their release-enhancing effect. Specifically, they require ongoing alpha(2C)-autoinhibition. The peptide effects that remain in alpha(2C)-autoreceptor-deficient mice seem to be because of alpha(2B)-autoinhibition. The results hence also suggest that in addition to alpha(2A)- and alpha(2C)- mouse postganglionic sympathetic neurons possess alpha(2B)-autoreceptors.
16901636	Reduction of cerebral infarct size by the AT1-receptor blocker candesartan, the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor rosuvastatin and their combination. An experimental study in rats.	Our purpose was to test the impact of single and/or combined treatment with the AT(1)-receptor blocker candesartan and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor rosuvastatin on infarct size and neuroscore in transient cerebral ischemia in rats. L-NAME was used to test whether any potential effect was due to activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Therefore, the middle cerebral artery was occluded for 1 h (MCAO) followed by 7 days reperfusion. Rats received candesartan 2h before and daily after MCAO (pretreatment) or daily after MCAO (posttreatment); rosuvastatin was given daily for 7 days before MCAO without or with candesartan pre- and posttreatment. In addition, candesartan and rosuvastatin were combined with L-NAME. Infarct size and neuroscore at day 7 were compared to those of controls. As result, compared to controls (109+/-12 mm(3)) infarct size with candesartan (pretreatment: 21+/-5 mm(3); posttreatment: 68+/-29 mm(3); P<0.05) or rosuvastatin (69+/-14 mm(3); P<0.05) was smaller. Combined treatment also reduced infarct size (pretreatment: 37+/-15 mm(3); posttreatment 57+/-20mm(3); P<0.05); but there was no benefit of combined treatment over candesartan pretreatment alone. Compared to controls (2.08+/-0.28) only candesartan pretreatment and combined treatment improved the neuroscore (0.97+/-0.05, 1.10+/-0.33; P<0.05). L-NAME abolished the reduction in infarct size and improvement in neuroscore. In conclusion, both, candesartan or rosuvastatin treatment alone reduced infarct size in transient cerebral ischemia, and the best result was achieved with candesartan pretreatment. Combined treatment was superior to rosuvastatin alone, but not to candesartan. The therapeutic benefit of both agents was at least in parts mediated by eNOS-activation.
23357361	β-Asarone induces senescence in colorectal cancer cells by inducing lamin B1 expression.	Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality with a complex carcinogenesis that includes reduced cellular senescence. Lamin proteins are decreased in senescing cells, and frequently decreased in malignancies. This study identified a new drug candidate for colorectal cancer that appears to target cell senescence via a lamin protein. β-Asarone (1-propenyl-2,4,5-methoxybenzol) is a compound from the traditional medical herb Acorus calamus Linn. This study tested the in vitro and in vivo effects of β-asarone on colorectal cancer cells by testing cell viability using human colorectal cell lines HT29 and SW480 in MTT assays; tumorigenesis using xenografts in nude mice and a mouse model of colorectal cancer; cell senescence using senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity; and expression of cancer and senescence-related proteins, specifically lamins, Oct-1, p53, p21, and p15, by Western blot. β-Asarone appeared to increase expression of lamin B1, p53, p21, but not lamin A/C. β-Asarone regulates p15 expression by regulation of Oct-1 binding. Collectively, the results suggested that β-asarone inhibits colon cancer formation in vivo and in vitro by inducing senescence. Since β-asarone induced lamin B1 expression, a model is proposed in which β-asarone inhibits colorectal cancer by inducing senescence through lamin B1.
11393267	Neuroparalysis and oxime efficacy in organophosphate poisoning: a study of butyrylcholinesterase.	The temporal profile of butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) and in vitro pralidoxime-reactivated BuChE was studied in a cohort of 25 organophosphate-poisoned patients to examine their relationship to the development of intermediate syndrome and to understand reasons for lack of efficacy of oxime treatment. The clinical severity of poisoning (assessed by the Namba Scale) correlated significantly with the severity of intermediate syndrome. BuChE activity increased significantly over time and showed significant relationship to muscle power. The temporal profile of the enzyme was correlated to the clinical severity of poisoning. Reactivation potentials of BuChE (the difference between oxime-reactivated and -unreactivated enzyme activity) declined significantly with time after organophosphate ingestion. The reactivation potential of the enzyme at admission decreased significantly with increasing severity of poisoning and was lower in patients who developed intermediate syndrome. Patients who received oxime prior to hospitalization had a higher rate of intermediate syndrome and lower levels of BuChE at admission than those who had not. The study suggests that (i) BuChE reflects the clinical course of poisoning, confirming earlier studies; (ii) intermediate syndrome may be associated with a persistent inhibition of BuChE; and (iii) the lack of oxime efficacy in our patients maybe due to their severity of poisoning and the timing of oxime treatment.
15562257	State-dependent mibefradil block of Na+ channels.	Mibefradil is a T-type Ca2+ channel antagonist with reported cross-reactivity with other classes of ion channels, including K+, Cl-, and Na+ channels. Using whole-cell voltage clamp, we examined mibefradil block of four Na+ channel isoforms expressed in human embryonic kidney cells: Nav1.5 (cardiac), Nav1.4 (skeletal muscle), Nav1.2 (brain), and Nav1.7 (peripheral nerve). Mibefradil blocked Nav1.5 in a use/frequency-dependent manner, indicating preferential binding to states visited during depolarization. Mibefradil blocked currents of all Na+ channel isoforms with similar affinity and a dependence on holding potential, and drug off-rate was slowed at depolarized potentials (k(off) was 0.024/s at -130 mV and 0.007/s at -100 mV for Nav1.5). We further probed the interaction of mibefradil with inactivated Nav1.5 channels. Neither the degree nor the time course of block was dependent on the stimulus duration, which dramatically changed the residency time of channels in the fast-inactivated state. In addition, inhibiting the binding of the fast inactivation lid (Nav1.5 ICM + MTSET) did not alter mibefradil block, confirming that the drug does not preferentially interact with the fast-inactivated state. We also tested whether mibefradil interacted with slow-inactivated state(s). When selectively applied to channels after inducing slow inactivation with a 60-s pulse to -10 mV, mibefradil (1 microM) produced 45% fractional block in Nav1.5 and greater block (88%) in an isoform (Nav1.4) that slow-inactivates more completely. Our results suggest that mibefradil blocks Na+ channels in a state-dependent manner that does not depend on fast inactivation but probably involves interaction with one or more slow-inactivated state(s).
23017389	Studies on the antioxidant potential of flavones of Allium vineale isolated from its water-soluble fraction.	The aim of this work was to examine the chemical constituents and antioxidant potential of water-soluble fractions from the commonly consumed vegetable, Allium vineale. The water-soluble fraction, containing phenolic compounds, was extracted with ethyl acetate to obtain flavonoids which were separated and purified by repeated column chromatography over Sephadex LH-20, RP C18 and silica gel. The isolated compounds were identified according to their physicochemical properties and spectral data (UV, HPLC-TOF/MS, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and 2D NMR). Three flavonoids were isolated and identified as chrysoeriol-7-O-[2″-O-E-feruloyl]-β-d-glucoside (1), chrysoeriol (2), and isorhamnetin-3-β-d-glucoside (3). Antioxidant studies of the aqueous extract and three isolated compounds, 1, 2, 3, were undertaken and they were found to have significant antioxidant activity. Antioxidant activities were evaluated for total antioxidant activity by the ferric thiocyanate method, ferric ion (Fe(3+)) reducing antioxidant power assay (FRAP), ferrous ion (Fe(2+)) metal chelating activity, and DPPH free radical-scavenging activity. The water-soluble ethyl acetate and methanol extraction methods were also compared using HPLC-TOF/MS.
17524933	An assay for the determination of sirolimus levels in the lymphocyte of transplant patients.	UNLABELLED: Both tacrolimus (TAC) and sirolimus (SRL) bind to the same immunophilin FKBP12; however, their mechanisms of action are distinct. SRL inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin (TOR), which is an enzyme critical to the immune function. TOR inhibition blocks the signal that mediates T-cell proliferation by preventing cell-cycle progression from G1 to S phase. Moreover, TOR inhibition results in a decrease in antibody production by blocking B-cell proliferation and maturation into antibody producing cells. The use of SRL has resulted in a decrease in the number of rejection episodes. As with other immunosuppressive agents, SRL can cause dose-related side effects, the most notable of which are hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Thus, therapeutic drug monitoring to assess efficacy and toxicity has became a necessity. SRL blood levels do not correlate with its bioactivity and are affected by the concomitant use of other immunosuppressive drugs. To determine the bioactivity of SRL we have developed an assay to determine the level of Sirolimus per lymphocyte of transplant patients. The levels were correlated with lymphocyte count. METHODS: Whole blood samples from patients on SRL were collected in Ethylene Diamine Tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) vacutainer tubes. Immediately the lymphocytes from 2 mL of blood were separated using 1.5 mL of Ficoll gradient, by centrifugation for 30 minutes at 2500 RPM. The lymphocytes were washed three times with phosphate-bufferd saline and the pellet suspended in 150 microL of Middle East research institute (MERI) drug extraction solution (Beirut, Lebanon), which was then added to 300 microL of IMx solublizing reagent. The cytoplasmic SRL concentrations in lymphocytes were measured using kits supplied from Abbott diagnostics or by high-performance liquid tomography. A corresponding whole blood sample from each patient was used to measure blood levels. To determine the level per lymphocyte, the value obtained was divided by the number of lymphocytes and expressed as Pg/cell. A pharmacokinetic profile for both blood and lymphocytes was constructed for each patient using data corresponding to predose C(0), 1 hour (C(1)) and 2 hours (C(2)) after the dose. The lymphocyte enumeration for C(0), C(1), and C(2) was performed using the FACS Calibur Flow Cytometer from Becton Dickinson. The average dose was 2.86 +/- 1.27 mg/d with a C(0) = 8.05 +/- 4.24, C(1) = 21.9 +/- 8.9 ng/mL, and C(2) = 23 +/- 0.03 ng/mL. Although there was a significant correlation (P=.0975) between the dose and C(0), there was no correlation between the dose and C(0) level on the lymphocyte count P=.897. However, there was a strong correlation between SRL lymphocyte levels (pg/cell) and the lymphocyte count (r(2)=.6.06). The higher the concentration of the drug the lower the lymphocyte counts. The assay is sensitive to within 0.45 pg/cell, reproducible with a coefficient of variance (CV) of 6.4% within assay and 7.5% for intraassay.
19281809	Sergliflozin etabonate, a selective SGLT2 inhibitor, improves glycemic control in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats and Zucker fatty rats.	The low-affinity sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT2) is responsible for most of the glucose reabsorption in the kidney and has been highlighted as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of diabetes. We discovered sergliflozin etabonate, a novel selective SGLT2 inhibitor, and found that selective inhibition of SGLT2 increased urinary glucose excretion and consequently decreased plasma glucose levels. In this report, we examined the antihyperglycemic effects of sergliflozin etabonate in normal and diabetic rats in comparison with those of a sulfonylurea (gliclazide) and an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor (voglibose). Sergliflozin etabonate increased urinary glucose excretion in a dose-dependent manner, and inhibited the increase in plasma glucose after sucrose loading independently of insulin secretion in normal rats. Sergliflozin etabonate also improved postprandial hyperglycemia in neonatal streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats; whereas gliclazide did not improve it. In rats with mild or moderate streptozotocin-induced diabetes, the degree of the antihyperglycemic effects of sergliflozin etabonate correlated with the severity of the diabetic condition. Sergliflozin etabonate did not affect the plasma glucose level of normal rats as seen with gliclazide. Chronic treatment with sergliflozin etabonate reduced the levels of glycated hemoglobin and fasting plasma glucose, and improved the glycemic response after glucose loading in Zucker fatty rats. In addition, sergliflozin etabonate did not affect the body weight or food intake. These data indicate that sergliflozin etabonate could improve glycemic control without its use resulting in insulin secretion, hypoglycemia, and body weight gain, and may provide a unique approach to the treatment of diabetes.
23234313	Influence of surface groups on poly(propylene imine) dendrimers antiprion activity.	Prion diseases are characterized by the accumulation of PrP(Sc), an aberrantly folded isoform of the host protein PrP(C). Specific forms of synthetic molecules known as dendrimers are able to eliminate protease-resistant PrP(Sc) in both an intracellular and in vitro setting. The properties of a dendrimer which govern this ability are unknown. We addressed the issue by comparing the in vitro antiprion ability of numerous modified poly(propylene-imine) dendrimers, which varied in size, structure, charge, and surface group composition. Several of the modified dendrimers, including an anionic glycodendrimer, reduced the level of protease resistant PrP(Sc) in a prion strain-dependent manner. This led to the formulation of a new working model for dendrimer/prion interactions which proposes dendrimers eliminate PrP(Sc) by destabilizing the protein and rendering it susceptible to proteolysis. This ability is not dependent on any particular charge of dendrimer, but does require a high density of reactive surface groups.
12565907	In situ and in vitro evidence for DCoH/HNF-1 alpha transcription of tyrosinase in human skin melanocytes.	Human epidermal melanocytes hold the full capacity for autocrine de novo synthesis/regulation/recycling of the essential cofactor 6-tetrahydrobiopterin (6BH(4)) for conversion of L-phenylalanine via phenylalanine hydroxylase to L-tyrosine and for production of L-Dopa via tyrosine hydroxylase to initiate both pigmentation and catecholamine synthesis in these neural crest-derived cells. Earlier we have demonstrated pterin-4a-carbinolamine dehydratase (PCD) mRNA and enzyme activities in epidermal melanocytes and keratinocytes. This protein dimerises also the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF-1), leading to activation of multiple genes. This study demonstrates for the first time DCoH/HNF-1 alpha expression and transcriptional activity in human epidermal melanocytes in vitro and in situ and identified tyrosinase, the key enzyme for pigmentation, as a new transcriptional target. Specific binding of DCoH/HNF-1 complex to the human tyrosinase promoter was confirmed by gel shift analysis. These results provide a novel mechanism in the regulation of skin pigmentation.
17853709	[Lipoprotein(a): a link between thrombogenesis and atherogenesis].	"INTRODUCTION: It is well known that numerous mechanisms of thrombogenesis can participate in every stage of atherosclerotic disease. The discovery of Lp(a) lipoprotein and its structural similarity with plasminogen suggests another pathogenic link between atherogenesis and thrombogenesis. SOME CHARACTERISTICS OF LP(A) LIPOPROTEIN: This lipoprotein is present in the whole human population in a wide range of plasma concentrations. It has numerous different isoforms. Its synthesis occurs in the liver, but it is practically metabolically independent from other lipoproteins. Today, Lp(a) lipoprotein is considered to be an independent risk factor for heart and brain ischemic disease. FIBRINOLYTIC MECHANISMS: The primary role of the fibrinolytic mechanism is to prevent thrombus Jormation during circulation and to remove already formed ones. Plasmin has a central role in this process, due to the inactive proenzyme plasminogen. Its basic activators are tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and urokinase plasminogen activator (u-PA). The most important inhibitors of plasminogen are alpha2-antiplasmin and plasminogen activator inhibitors 1 and 2 (PA-1 and PAI-2). Structural similarity of Lp(a) and plasminogen The apo(a) and plasminogen genes are very closely linked on the long arm of chromosome 6. Because of that they are structuraly very similar and they have a cross immunological reactivity. Their common elements are so-called ""kringle"" structures. The key difference in structure of Lp(a) and plasminogen is replacement of Arg with Ser at position 560. This prevents splitting of apo(a) by plasminogen activators. LP(A) AND FIBRINOLYSIS: Lp(a) lipoprotein inhibits activation of plasminogen by streptokinase. It is also a competitive inhibitor of plasminogen for its binding to plasminogen receptors. Furthermore, it successfully achieves competitive inhibition of plasminogen for binding to tetranectin and thrombospondin. Also, Lp(a) inhibits activation of transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha). It positively correlates with PAI-1 and it is assumed that it promotes release of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (17FPI) from endothelial cell surfaces. CONCLUSION: In regulation of the hemostatic system via apolipoprotein(a) antifibrinolytic effects, Lp(a) lipoprotein ojfers a molecular solution to the link between thrombogenesis and atherogenesis."
12398910	MDMA- and p-chlorophenylalanine-induced reduction in 5-HT concentrations: effects on serotonin transporter densities.	"Low levels of serotonin may reduce the density of the serotonin transporter (SERT) by either increasing trafficking or reducing synthesis; a ""neuroadaptive response"". To determine whether 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-induced reductions in SERT density could be related to such a mechanism, p-chlorophenylalanine or MDMA was administered to rats, and brain serotonin and SERT density were measured. As expected, both treatments led to serotonin depletion 1, 7 and 14 days later. However, only MDMA reduced SERT density. This observation suggests that MDMA-induced reductions in SERT density do not represent neuroadaptive responses to decreased levels of brain serotonin, but may occur in response to some other stimulus or to the neurotoxic effects of MDMA."
23611338	Reaction between peroxynitrite and triphenylphosphonium-substituted arylboronic acid isomers - Identification of diagnostic marker products and biological implications.	</i>Aromatic boronic acids react rapidly with peroxynitrite (ONOO<sup>-</sup>) to yield phenols as major products. This reaction was used to monitor ONOO<sup>-</sup> formation in cellular systems. Previously, we proposed that the reaction between ONOO<sup>-</sup> and arylboronates (PhB(OH)<sub>2</sub>) yields a phenolic product (major pathway) and a radical pair PhB(OH)<sub>2</sub>O<sup>•-</sup>…<sup>•</sup>NO<sub>2</sub> (minor pathway). [Sikora A. <i>et al., Chem Res Toxicol</i> 24, 687-97]. In this study, we investigated the influence of a bulky triphenylphosphonium (TPP) group on the reaction between ONOO<sup>-</sup> and mitochondria-targeted arylboronate isomers (<i>o</i>-, <i>m</i>-, and <i>p</i>-MitoPhB(OH)<sub>2</sub>). Results from the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin-trapping experiments unequivocally showed the presence of a phenyl radical intermediate from <i>meta</i> and <i>para</i> isomers, and not from the <i>ortho</i> isomer. The yield of <i>o</i>-MitoPhNO<sub>2</sub> formed from the reaction between <i>o</i>-MitoPhB(OH)<sub>2</sub> and ONOO<sup>-</sup> was not diminished by phenyl radical scavengers, suggesting a rapid fragmentation of the <i>o</i>-MitoPhB(OH)<sub>2</sub>O<sup>•-</sup> radical anion with subsequent reaction of the resulting phenyl radical with <sup>•</sup>NO<sub>2</sub> in the solvent cage. The DFT quantum mechanical calculations showed that the energy barrier for the dissociation of <i>o</i>-MitoPhB(OH)<sub>2</sub>O<sup>•-</sup> radical anion is significantly lower than that of <i>m</i>-MitoPhB(OH)<sub>2</sub>O<sup>•-</sup> and <i>p</i>-MitoPhB(OH)<sub>2</sub>O<sup>•-</sup> radical anions. We conclude that the reaction of ONOO<sup>-</sup> with <i>ortho</i>-MitoPhB(OH)<sub>2</sub> forming the minor nitrated product, <i>o</i>-MitoPhNO<sub>2</sub>, and the corresponding major phenolic product (<i>o</i>-MitoPhOH) can be employed as a diagnostic tool to specifically detect ONOO<sup>-</sup> in biological systems.
11102491	NMDA and glutamate evoke excitotoxicity at distinct cellular locations in rat cortical neurons in vitro.	The development of cortical neurons in vivo and in vitro is accompanied by alterations in NMDA receptor subunit expression and concomitant modifications in the pharmacological profile of NMDA-activated ionic currents. For example, we observed that with decreasing NR2B/NR2A subunit expression ratio, the block of NMDA receptor-mediated whole-cell responses by the NR2B-selective antagonist haloperidol was also decreased. In mature cultures (>22 d in vitro), however, NMDA responses obtained from excised nucleated macropatches, which comprised a large portion of the soma, remained strongly antagonized by haloperidol. These results suggest that in more mature neurons NR1/NR2B receptors appear to be preferentially expressed in the cell body. As predicted from the whole-cell recording pharmacological profile, NMDA-induced toxicity was largely unaffected by haloperidol in mature cultures. However, haloperidol effectively blocked glutamate toxicity in the same cultures, suggesting that the neurotoxic actions of this amino acid were mostly due to the activation of somatic NMDA receptors. In experiments in which the potency of glutamate toxicity was increased by the transport inhibitor l-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid, the neuroprotective effects of haloperidol were significantly diminished. This was likely because of the fact that glutamate, now toxic at much lower concentrations, was able to reach and activate dendritic receptors under these conditions. These results strongly argue that exogenous glutamate and NMDA normally induce excitotoxicity at distinct cellular locations in mature mixed neuronal cultures and that NR1/NR2B receptors remain an important component in the expression of glutamate, but not NMDA-induced excitotoxicity.
17141733	The pH-dependent distribution of the photosensitizer chlorin e6 among plasma proteins and membranes: a physico-chemical approach.	Decrease in interstitial pH of the tumor stroma and over-expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors by several types of neoplastic cells have been suggested to be important determinants of selective retention of photosensitizers by proliferative tissues. The interactions of chlorin e6 (Ce6), a photosensitizer bearing three carboxylic groups, with plasma proteins and DOPC unilamellar vesicles are investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy. The binding constant to liposomes, with reference to the DOPC concentration, is 6 x 10(3) M(-1) at pH 7.4. Binding of Ce6 to LDL involves about ten high affinity sites close to the apoprotein and some solubilization in the lipid compartment. The overall association constant is 5.7 x 10(7) M(-1) at pH 7.4. Human serum albumin (HSA) is the major carrier (association constant 1.8 x 10(8) M(-1) at pH 7.4). Whereas the affinity of Ce6 for LDL and liposomes increases at lower pH, it decreases for albumin. Between pH 7.4 and 6.5, the relative affinities of Ce6 for LDL versus HSA, and for membranes versus HSA, are multiplied by 4.6 and 3.5, respectively. These effects are likely driven by the ionization equilibria of the photosensitizer carboxylic chains. Then, the cellular uptake of chlorin e6 may be facilitated by its pH-mediated redistribution within the tumor stroma.
20512624	A possible role of the non-GAT1 GABA transporters in transfer of GABA from GABAergic to glutamatergic neurons in mouse cerebellar neuronal cultures.	Cultures of dissociated cerebellum from 7-day-old mice were used to investigate the mechanism involved in synthesis and cellular redistribution of GABA in these cultures consisting primarily of glutamatergic granule neurons and a smaller population of GABAergic Golgi and stellate neurons. The distribution of GAD, GABA and the vesicular glutamate transporter VGlut-1 was assessed using specific antibodies combined with immunofluorescence microscopy. Additionally, tiagabine, SKF 89976-A, betaine, beta-alanine, nipecotic acid and guvacine were used to inhibit the GAT1, betaine/GABA (BGT1), GAT2 and GAT3 transporters. Only a small population of cells were immuno-stained for GAD while many cells exhibited VGlut-1 like immuno-reactivity which, however, never co-localized with GAD positive neurons. This likely reflects the small number of GABAergic neurons compared to the glutamatergic granule neurons constituting the majority of the cells. GABA uptake exhibited the kinetics of high affinity transport and could be partly (20%) inhibited by betaine (IC(50) 142 microM), beta-alanine (30%) and almost fully (90%) inhibited by SKF 89976-A (IC(50) 0.8 microM) or nipecotic acid and guvacine at 1 mM concentrations (95%). Essentially all neurons showed GABA like immunostaining albeit with differences in intensity. The results indicate that GABA which is synthesized in a small population of GAD-positive neurons is redistributed to essentially all neurons including the glutamatergic granule cells. GAT1 is not likely involved in this redistribution since addition of 15 microM tiagabine (GAT1 inhibitor) to the culture medium had no effect on the overall GABA content of the cells. Likewise the BGT1 transporter cannot alone account for the redistribution since inclusion of 3 mM betaine in the culture medium had no effect on the overall GABA content. The inhibitory action of beta-alanine and high concentrations of nipecotic acid and guvacine on GABA transport strongly suggests that also GAT2 or GAT3 (HUGO nomenclature) could play a role.
8384226	Inhibition of cytokine-primed eosinophil chemotaxis by nedocromil sodium.	BACKGROUND: Eosinophil influx into the lung tissue is considered to be relevant for the pathogenesis of asthma. Various chemotactic factors may be responsible for this influx. Recently it has been demonstrated that the cytokines granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-3 (IL-3), and interleukin-5 (IL-5) are present in the circulation of individuals with allergic asthma. These cytokines have the capacity to modulate chemotactic responses of eosinophils toward platelet-activating factor, formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, (FMLP) and neutrophil-activating factor (NAF)/IL-8, but not toward complement fragment C5a (C5a). Here the effect of nedocromil sodium on the chemotactic response of eosinophils from allergic asthmatic individuals and from normal donors preincubated with GM-CSF or IL-3 toward FMLP, NAF/IL-8 was evaluated. RESULTS: Nedocromil sodium inhibited the chemotactic response toward FMLP and NAF/IL-8 of GM-CSF primed eosinophils approximately 60% (inhibitory concentration of 50% [IC50] approximately 1 to 10 nmol/L), whereas these responses of IL-3 primed eosinophils was completely inhibited (IC50 approximately 1 nmol/L). CONCLUSIONS: The chemotactic responses toward C5a were inhibited by nedocromil sodium at higher concentrations than were required in the priming studies (IC50 approximately 10 to 100 nmol/L). Nedocromil sodium (0.1 mumol/L) was also effective in inhibiting the chemotactic response toward FMLP (10 nmol/L) of eosinophils isolated from the circulation of patients with allergic asthma 3 hours after allergen challenge. These findings might explain in part the antiinflammatory action of nedocromil sodium.
16437532	Cholinesterase inhibitors for Alzheimer's disease.	"BACKGROUND: Since the introduction of the first cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI) in 1997, most clinicians and probably most patients would consider the cholinergic drugs, donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine, to be the first line pharmacotherapy for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.The drugs have slightly different pharmacological properties, but they all work by inhibiting the breakdown of acetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter associated with memory, by blocking the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. The most that these drugs could achieve is to modify the manifestations of Alzheimer's disease. Cochrane reviews of each ChEI for Alzheimer's disease have been completed (Birks 2005, Birks 2005b and Loy 2005). Despite the evidence from the clinical studies and the intervening clinical experience the debate on whether ChEIs are effective continues. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine in people with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register was searched using the terms 'donepezil', 'E2020' , 'Aricept' , galanthamin* galantamin* reminyl, rivastigmine, exelon, ""ENA 713"" and ENA-713 on 12 June 2005. This Register contains up-to-date records of all major health care databases and many ongoing trial databases. SELECTION CRITERIA: All unconfounded, blinded, randomized trials in which treatment with a ChEI was compared with placebo or another ChEI for patients with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted by one reviewer (JSB), pooled where appropriate and possible, and the pooled treatment effects, or the risks and benefits of treatment estimated. MAIN RESULTS: The results of 13 randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trials demonstrate that treatment for periods of 6 months and one year, with donepezil, galantamine or rivastigmine at the recommended dose for people with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease produced improvements in cognitive function, on average -2.7 points (95%CI -3.0 to -2.3), in the midrange of the 70 point ADAS-Cog Scale. Study clinicians blind to other measures rated global clinical state more positively in treated patients. Benefits of treatment were also seen on measures of activities of daily living and behaviour. None of these treatment effects are large. There is nothing to suggest the effects are less for patients with severe dementia or mild dementia, although there is very little evidence for other than mild to moderate dementia.More patients leave ChEI treatment groups, approximately 29 %, on account of adverse events than leave the placebo groups (18%). There is evidence of more adverse events in total in the patients treated with a ChEI than with placebo. Although many types of adverse event were reported, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, were significantly more frequent in the ChEI groups than in placebo. There are four studies, all supported by one of the pharmaceutical companies, in which two ChEIs were compared, two studies of donepezil compared with galantamine, and two of donepezil compared with rivastigmine. In three studies the patients were not blinded to treatment, only the fourth, DON vs RIV/Bullock is double blind. Two of the studies provide little evidence, they are of 12 weeks duration, which is barely long enough to complete the drug titration. There is no evidence from DON vs GAL/Wilcock of a treatment difference between donepezil and galantamine at 52 weeks for cognition, activities of daily living, the numbers who leave the trial before the end of treatment, the number who suffer any adverse event, or any specific adverse event. There is no evidence from DON vs RIV/Bullock of a difference between donepezil and rivastigmine for cognitive function, activities of daily living and behavioural disturbance at two years. Fewer patients suffer adverse events on donepezil than rivastigmine. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The three cholinesterase inhibitors are efficacious for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. It is not possible to identify those who will respond to treatment prior to treatment. There is no evidence that treatment with a ChEI is not cost effective. Despite the slight variations in the mode of action of the three cholinesterase inhibitors there is no evidence of any differences between them with respect to efficacy. There appears to be less adverse effects associated with donepezil compared with rivastigmine. It may be that galantamine and rivastigmine match donepezil in tolerability if a careful and gradual titration routine over more than three months is used. Titration with donepezil is more straightforward and the lower dose may be worth consideration."
12401318	Chemical responsiveness and histochemical phenotype of electrophysiologically classified cells of the adult rat dorsal root ganglion.	Whole cell patch recordings were obtained from medium diameter (35-45 microm) dorsal root ganglion neurons. Using electrophysiological parameters, we were able to subclassify acutely dissociated dorsal root ganglion cells into three uniform (types 5, 6 and 9) and one mixed class (type 8) of neurons. All subtypes (types 5, 6, 8 and 9) had broad action potentials (7.0+/-0.2, 5.2+/-0.4, 7.3+/-0.5 and 6.0+/-0.4 ms) and exceptionally long afterhyperpolarizations (112+/-9, 178+/-19, 124+/-31 and 204+/-33 ms). Long afterhyperpolarizations have been linked to mechanically insensitive (silent) nociceptors by other laboratories [Djouhri et al., J. Physiol. 513 (1998) 857-872]. Chemosensitivity varied among cell classes. Cell types 5, 8 and 9 were capsaicin sensitive (45+/-13, 87+/-30 and 28+/-13 pA/pF; 5 microM) groups, while the type 6 cell was capsaicin insensitive. All cell types expressed ASIC-like (acid sensing ion channel) amiloride sensitive, proton-activated currents with a threshold of pH 6.8 and a peak near pH 5.0. All medium sized cells were sensitive to ATP (50 microM) and exhibited the 'mixed' form of ATP-gated current [Burgard et al., J. Neurophysiol. 82 (1999) 1590-1598; Grubb and Evans, Eur. J. Neurosci. 11 (1999) 149-154]. Immunohistochemistry performed on individual cells indicated the expression of both P2X(1) and P2X(3) subunits. Electrophysiologically defined classes were histochemically uniform. All types were examined for the presence of substance P (SP), calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) and binding of isolectin B4 (IB4). All subtypes expressed CGRP immunoreactivity. Types 5 and 8 co-expressed SP and CGRP immunoreactivity and also bound IB4. Subtypes 6 and 9 were positive for neurofilament m. It is likely that these cells represent major classes of myelinated and unmyelinated peptide expressing nociceptors.
23229509	Regions on adenylyl cyclase VII required for selective regulation by the G13 pathway.	Regulation of multiple adenylyl cyclases (AC) provides unique inputs to mediate the synthesis of cAMP, a ubiquitous second messenger that controls many aspects of cellular function. On stimulation by G(s), the activities of ACs can be further selectively modulated by other pathways to ensure precise control of intracellular cAMP responses to specific stimuli. Recently, we reported that one of the AC isoforms, AC7, is uniquely regulated by the G(13) pathway. To understand more fully the molecular mechanism of this regulation, we compared the regulation of AC7 with that of AC2 in bone marrow-derived macrophages devoid of AC7. Although both enzymes could fully restore regulation of cAMP by Gβγ, activation of the G(13) pathway preferentially synergized with AC7. Exchange of domains between the two isoforms indicates that the C1b domain and the N-terminus of the C1a domain are important for directing selective regulation of AC7 by the G(13) pathway. A mutagenesis screen identified more specific regions of AC7 that differentially mediate its regulation by distinct pathways.
22849656	NT, NPY and PGP 9.5 presence in myomeytrium and in fibroid pseudocapsule and their possible impact on muscular physiology.	The uterine myoma pseudocapsule is a neurovascular bundle surrounding fibroid, containing neuropeptides, probably involved in uterine scar healing. We studied neurotensin (NT), neuropeptide tyrosine (NPY), and protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) nerve fibres in the pseudocapsule neurovascular bundle of intramural uterine fibroids on 67 no pregnant women by intracapsular myomectomy sparing the neurovascular bundle, sampling full thickness specimens of the pseudocapsule of uterine fibroids (PUF) and normal myometrium (NM) obtained from the fundus uteri (FU) and the uterine body (UB). The samples were sent for histological and immunofluorescent analyses and compared by morphometrical quantification. The Conventional Unit (C.U.) difference of NT, NPY, and PGP 9.5 nerve fibres was statistically analyzed. Our results showed that NT, NPY, and PGP 9.5 neurofibers are almost equally present in PUF as in NM of a no pregnant uterus. As all of these neuropeptides are present in the uterine muscle and can affect muscle contractility, uterine peristalsis and muscular healing. A myomectomy respecting the pseudocapsule neurofibers should facilitate smooth muscle scarring and promote restoration of normal uterine peristalsis with a possible positive influence on fertility.
16546990	Sulindac independently modulates extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase signaling pathways.	Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States. Substantial human and animal data support the ability of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to cause regression of existing colon tumors and prevent new tumor formation. The mechanism by which the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug sulindac prevents tumor growth is poorly understood and seems complex as sulindac can modulate several growth-related signaling pathways. Sulindac metabolites simultaneously (a) increase cellular cyclic GMP and subsequently activate cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG); (b) activate c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK); (c) inhibit extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2); and (d) decrease beta-catenin protein expression at times and doses consistent with apoptosis. The purpose of this study was to determine if PKG, ERK1/2, JNK, and beta-catenin are independent targets for sulindac in vitro. Pharmacologic activation of PKG with YC-1 increases JNK phosphorylation and induces apoptosis in colon cancer cells without modulating ERK1/2 phosphorylation or beta-catenin protein expression. Inhibition of ERK1/2 with U0126 induces apoptosis but fails to activate JNK phosphorylation or down-regulate beta-catenin protein expression. Cotreatment with U0126 and YC-1 synergistically increases apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells and recapitulates the effects of sulindac treatment on ERK1/2, JNK, and beta-catenin. These results indicate that sulindac metabolites modulate ERK1/2 and PKG pathways independently in colon cancer cells and suggest that the full apoptotic effect of sulindac is mediated by more than one pathway. Using similar combinatorial approaches in vivo may provide more effective, less toxic chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic strategies. Such therapies could dramatically reduce the incidence and death rate from colorectal cancer.
1712335	Studies on the mechanism of arterial vasodilation produced by the novel antihypertensive agent, carvedilol.	The mechanism(s) responsible for arterial vasodilation observed following acute administration of racemic carvedilol, a novel vasodilator/beta adrenoceptor antagonist, has been investigated in rats. In conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats, carvedilol (0.03-3.0 mg/kg, iv) produced a dose-dependent reduction in blood pressure with no significant effect on heart rate. Because cardiac output was relatively unaffected, the antihypertensive response of carvedilol was associated with a dose-dependent reduction in total peripheral vascular resistance. Submaximal antihypertensive doses of carvedilol were chosen for mechanism of action studies in pithed rats. Carvedilol (0.3 mg/kg, iv) produced a significant inhibition of the beta 1 adrenoceptor mediated positive chronotropic response to isoproterenol. This same dose of carvedilol also inhibited, but to a lesser degree, the beta 2 adrenoceptor mediated vasodepressor response to salbutamol in pithed rats whose blood pressure was elevated by a constant intravenous infusion of angiotensin II. Thus, carvedilol blocks both beta 1 and beta 2 adrenoceptors at antihypertensive doses, with modest selectivity being observed for the beta 1 adrenoceptor subtype. Carvedilol produced significant inhibition of the alpha 1 adrenoceptor mediated pressor response to cirazoline in the pithed rat, but had no effect on the alpha 2 adrenoceptor mediated pressor response to B-HT 933, suggesting that carvedilol is also an alpha 1 adrenoceptor antagonist at antihypertensive doses. Carvedilol had no effect on the pressor response elicited by angiotensin II, indicating a lack of nonspecific vasodilator activity. The vasopressor response to the calcium channel activator, BAY-K-8644, which is mediated through the opening of voltage dependent calcium channels and the subsequent translocation of extracellular calcium, was significantly inhibited by carvedilol (1 mg/kg, iv), suggesting that carvedilol is also a calcium channel antagonist, consistent with our previous in vitro studies. In anesthetized spontaneously hypertensive rats, the antihypertensive activity of carvedilol was nearly abolished by combined pretreatment of the rats with high doses of the alpha 1 adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin (1 mg/kg, iv), and the nonselective beta adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol (3 mg/kg, iv), suggesting that the majority of the antihypertensive response produced by carvedilol may be accounted for by blockade of beta and alpha 1 adrenoceptors. We therefore conclude that carvedilol, at antihypertensive doses, is an antagonist of beta 1, beta 2, and alpha 1 adrenoceptors, and also of calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
23200253	Further exploration of M₁ allosteric agonists: subtle structural changes abolish M₁ allosteric agonism and result in pan-mAChR orthosteric antagonism.	This letter describes the further exploration of two series of M(1) allosteric agonists, TBPB and VU0357017, previously reported from our lab. Within the TPBP scaffold, either electronic or steric perturbations to the central piperidine ring led to a loss of selective M(1) allosteric agonism and afforded pan-mAChR antagonism, which was demonstrated to be mediated via the orthosteric site. Additional SAR around a related M(1) allosteric agonist family (VU0357017) identified similar, subtle 'molecular switches' that modulated modes of pharmacology from allosteric agonism to pan-mAChR orthosteric antagonism. Therefore, all of these ligands are best classified as bi-topic ligands that possess high affinity binding at an allosteric site to engender selective M(1) activation, but all bind, at higher concentrations, to the orthosteric ACh site, leading to non-selective orthosteric site binding and mAChR antagonism.
23411172	Apple polyphenols suppress antigen presentation of ovalbumin by THP-1-derived dendritic cells.	Apple polyphenol extract (AP) and procyanidin contained in AP were investigated for their immunomodulatory effects using THP-1-derived human dendritic cells (TDDCs). The expression levels of HLA-DR (MHC class II) and CD86 (costimulatory molecule) were measured as an indicator of antigen presentation in TDDCs. A significant decrease in HLA-DR expression was observed in the AP and fractionated procyanidin-treated cells in the presence of ovalbumin (OVA), but no effect on CD86 expression was observed. The uptake of OVA was not inhibited by AP treatment, and the gene expression of membrane-associated RING-CH ubiquitin E3 ligase, MARCH1, was up-regulated by AP treatment. It can therefore be presumed that AP suppresses HLA-DR expression via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Furthermore, the up-regulation of IL-12 and TNF-α was found in the procyanidin trimers-treated cells in the presence of OVA. These results suggest that apple polyphenols would be an effective factor for the development of immunomodulatory agents with suppressive effects of antigen presentation.
23597099	2-Methoxyjuglone Induces Apoptosis in HepG2 Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells and Exhibits in Vivo Antitumor Activity in a H22 Mouse Hepatocellular Carcinoma Model.	In order to discover anticancer agents from natural sources, an ethanol-soluble extract of the root bark of Juglans cathayensis was investigated and showed cytotoxic effects against various human cancer cell lines. A subsequent phytochemical study on the EtOAc-soluble fraction determined 2-methoxyjuglone (1) as one of the main active constituents. Compound 1 was shown to be cytotoxic against HepG2 cells. Morphological features of apoptosis were observed in 1-treated HepG2 cells, including cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation, and apoptotic body formation. Cell cycle analysis with propidium iodide staining showed that 1 induced cell cycle arrest at the S phase in HepG2 cells. Flow cytometric analysis with annexin V and propidium iodide staining demonstrated that 1 induced HepG2 cell apoptotic events in a dose-dependent manner (0-8 μg/mL). Western blot analysis of apoptosis-related proteins revealed that 1 induces HepG2 cell apoptosis through mitochondrial cytochrome c-dependent activation of the caspase-9 and caspase-3 cascade pathway (intrinsic pathway). An in vivo experiment using tumor-bearing mice showed that treatment with 1 at 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg per day decreased the tumor mass by 56% and 67%, respectively.
23276627	Methylation damage to RNA induced in vivo in Escherichia coli is repaired by endogenous AlkB as part of the adaptive response.	Cytotoxic 1-methyladenine (1-meA) and 3-methylcytosine (3-meC) lesions induced in DNA and RNA in vitro and in pre-damaged DNA and RNA bacteriophages in vivo are repaired by the Escherichia coli (E. coli) protein AlkB and a human homolog, ALKBH3. However, it is not known whether endogenous RNA is repaired in vivo by repair proteins present at physiological concentrations. The concept of RNA repair as a biologically relevant process has therefore remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate AlkB-mediated repair of endogenous RNA in vivo by measuring differences in lesion-accumulation in two independent AlkB-proficient and deficient E. coli strains during exposure to methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). Repair was observed both in AlkB-overproducing strains and in the wild-type strains after AlkB induction. RNA repair appeared to be highest in RNA species below 200 nucleotides in size, mainly comprising tRNAs. Strikingly, at least 10-fold more lesions were repaired in RNA than in DNA. This may be a consequence of some 30-fold higher levels of aberrant methylation in RNA than in DNA after exposure to MMS. A high primary kinetic isotope effect (>10) was measured using a deuterated methylated RNA substrate, D3-1me(rA), demonstrating that it is the catalytic step, and not the search step that is rate-limiting. Our results demonstrate that RNA repair by AlkB takes place in endogenous RNA as part of an adaptive response in wild-type E. coli cells.
16449355	Overexpression of kidney neutral endopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.11) and renal function in experimental cirrhosis.	Neutral endopeptidase degrades atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and bradykinin and may generate endothelin-1 from big-endothelin. In advanced cirrhosis, sodium retention is accompanied by elevated plasma ANP levels, and infusion of ANP causes hypotension, but in normal humans increasing the concentration of ANP through the inhibition of neutral endopeptidase, localized in renal proximal tubule cells, causes natriuresis without any arterial pressure drop. The purpose of this study was the assessment of kidney neutral endopeptidase expression and responses to candoxatrilat (a specific inhibitor of this enzyme) in rats with CCl4-induced cirrhosis. Two groups of control rats (n = 5) were injected with vehicle or 3 mg/kg candoxatrilat. Three groups of cirrhotic rats with ascites (n = 10) received vehicle alone or 3 or 10 mg/kg candoxatrilat. In cirrhotic rats, Western blot analysis revealed a 170% increase in renal neutral endopeptidase protein content (P < 0.03), mainly in the proximal nephron and macula densa, and both candoxatrilat dosages increased plasma ANP levels, urinary volume, and urinary excretion of sodium, ANP, and cGMP compared with vehicle alone (all P < 0.03). Candoxatrilat (10 mg/kg) also reduced tubular solute-free water reabsorption (P < 0.03) in cirrhotic rats, but renal blood flow, arterial pressure, and plasma renin activity were unaffected. Neutral endopeptidase inhibition has natriuretic and aquaretic actions in cirrhosis without any effect on blood pressure and kidney perfusion due to a significant overexpression of this enzyme in renal cortex.
23589462	(13) C-Detected Through-Bond Correlation Experiments for Protein Resonance Assignment by Ultra-Fast MAS Solid-State NMR.	"We present two sequences which combine ((1) H,(15) N) and ((15) N,(13) C) selective cross-polarization steps with an efficient variant of the J-based homonuclear transfer scheme, in which a spin-state-selective (S(3) E) block is incorporated to improve both resolution and sensitivity in the direct (13) C dimension. We propose these two sequences as a part of a suite of four N-C correlation experiments allowing for the assignment of protein backbone resonances in the solid state. We illustrate these experiments under ultra-fast magic angle spinning conditions on two samples of microcrystalline dimeric human superoxide dismutase (SOD, 153×2 amino acids), in its diamagnetic (""empty"", Zn(II) ) and paramagnetic (Cu(II) , Zn(II) ) states."
23248236	Inhibition of bacterial thioredoxin reductase: an antibiotic mechanism targeting bacteria lacking glutathione.	Increasing antibiotic resistance makes the identification of new antibacterial principles an urgent task. The thioredoxin system including thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), thioredoxin (Trx), and NADPH plays critical roles in cellular DNA synthesis and defense against oxidative stress. Notably, TrxR is very different in structure and mechanism in mammals and bacteria. Ebselen [2-phenyl-1,2 benzisoselenazol-3(2H)-one], a well-known antioxidant and a substrate for mammalian TrxR and Trx, is rapidly bacteriocidal for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus by an unknown mechanism. We have discovered that ebselen is a competitive inhibitor of Escherichia coli TrxR with a Ki of 0.52 ± 0.13 μM, through reaction with the active site dithiol of the enzyme. Bacteria lacking glutathione (GSH) and glutaredoxin, in which TrxR and Trx are essential for DNA synthesis, were particularly sensitive to ebselen. In growth-inhibited E. coli strains, Trx1 and Trx2 were oxidized, demonstrating that electron transfer via thioredoxin was blocked. Ebselen and its sulfur analog ebsulfur were bactericidal for GSH-negative pathogens. Ebsulfur inhibited a clinically isolated Helicobacter pylori strain with a minimum inhibitory concentration value as low as 0.39 μg/ml. These results demonstrate that bacterial Trx and TrxR are viable antibacterial drug targets using benzisoselenazol and benzisothiazol derivates.-Lu, J., Vlamis-Gardikas, A., Kandasamy, K., Zhao, R., Gustafsson, T. N., Engstrand, L., Hoffner, S., Engman, L., Holmgren, A. Inhibition of bacterial thioredoxin reductase: an antibiotic mechanism targeting bacteria lacking glutathione.
15236843	Site-directed mutagenesis of the rat beta1-adrenoceptor. Involvement of Tyr356 (7.43) in (+/-)cyanopindolol but not (+/-)[125Iodo]cyanopindolol binding.	"To determine the role played by Tyr(356 (7.43)) in the rat beta(1)-adrenoceptor in binding the antagonists (+/-)cyanopindolol (4-[3-(t-butylamino]-3-(2'-cyano-indoloxy)-2-propanolol) and its iodinated analogue (+/-)[(125)Iodo]cyanopindolol (1-(t-butylamino]-3-(2'-cyano-3'-iodo-indoloxy)-2-propanolol), Tyr(356 (7.43)) was mutated to either Phe or Ala and binding affinities determined for wild type and mutant rat beta(1)-adrenoceptors. Our results indicate that Tyr(356 (7.43)) is important for (+/-)cyanopindolol, but not (+/-)[(125)Iodo]cyanopindolol, binding and that (+/-)cyanopindolol adopts a ""reverse"" binding orientation whereas (+/-)[(125)Iodo]cyanopindolol cannot be accommodated in this binding mode. We define a ""reverse"" antagonist binding mode as one where the aryloxy moiety interacts with residues on transmembrane helices 1, 2, 3 and 7. The beta(1)-adrenoceptor site-directed mutagenesis results are the first to support a ""reverse"" antagonist binding orientation and the involvement of Tyr(356 (7.43)) in this binding mode."
23231808	Acetazolamide impairs fear memory consolidation in rodents.	Acetazolamide (AZ) is an carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, which has been used in the treatment of seizures, mountain sickness and glaucoma. Memory impairment by AZ has been reported in patient interviews; however, the related mechanism is unclear. We applied two fear conditioning paradigms, shuttle avoidance and passive avoidance, in both rats and mice to investigate this clinical anecdote. Adult Wistar rats receiving AZ 1 h before the shuttle avoidance test showed decreased avoidance rates, especially at high dosage. Adult ICR mice receiving AZ both before and after acquisition trials showed the decreased step-through latencies during the passive avoidance test. This impairment of fear memory was corroborated with decreased LTP by AZ in the amygdala. AZ only inhibited fear conditioning-induced ERK phosphorylation and had no effect on Akt phosphorylation. In conclusion, our study confirmed the adverse cognitive effect of AZ in animal and electrophysiological studies. In clinical practice, clinicians should be aware of this side effect in patients taking AZ. In addition, this inhibition of fear memory by AZ could potentially be applied to patients with posttraumatic stress disorder.
17315049	Sitagliptin: Profile of a novel DPP-4 inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.	Novel therapeutic strategies for type 2 diabetes are needed, since the current treatment options neither address all pathophysiological mechanisms nor achieve the glycemic target goals. A general islet-cell dysfunction including insulin- and glucagon-secretion defects contributes to the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes. Improving islet function by incretin hormone action is a novel therapeutic approach. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) are important incretin hormones contributing to 50-70% of the stimulation of insulin secretion after a meal. Dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (DPP-4) inhibitors inhibit the degradation of GLP-1 and GIP as well as that of other regulatory peptides. Sitagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor, is orally active and has been shown to be efficacious and safe in clinical studies. Sitagliptin has received approval in Mexico, the United States and other countries. Like other DPP-4 inhibitors, sitagliptin reduces hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting and postprandial glucose by glucose-dependent stimulation of insulin secretion and inhibition of glucagon secretion. Sitagliptin is weight neutral. Indirect measures show a possible improvement of beta-cell function. Sitagliptin does not cause a higher rate of hypoglycemia in comparison to metformin or placebo. This article gives an overview of the mechanisms of action, pharmacology and clinical trial results of sitagliptin.
